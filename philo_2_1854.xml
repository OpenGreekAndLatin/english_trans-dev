            <title type="main">A TREATISE ON THE CONFUSION OF LANGUAGES.</title>
          </head>
          <p>I. As to the preceding topics, what has been already said will <lb/>
            be sufficient. We must next proceed to consider, and that in <lb/>
            no slight or cursory manner, the philosophical account which <lb/>
            Moses gives us of the confusion of languages ; for he speaks in <lb/>
            the following manner: “ And all the earth had one pronuncia­ <lb/>
            tion, and there was one language among all men. And it came <lb/>
            to pass, as they were moving from the east, that they found a <lb/>
            plain in the land of Shinar, and dwelt there. And one man <lb/>
            said to his neighbour, Come, let us make bricks, and let us burr <lb/>
            them with fire; and they had bricks for stone, and asphalt for <lb/>
            mortar. And they said, Come, let us build ourselves a city, and <lb/>
            a tower whose head shall reach to heaven ; and let us make for <lb/>
            ourselves a name, before we are scattered over the face of all <lb/>
            the earth. And the Lord came down to see the city, and the <lb/>
            tower, which the sons of men had builded. And the Lord said, <lb/>
            Behold, all mankind is one race, and there is but one language <lb/>
            among them all; and they have begun to do this thing, and now <lb/>
            there will not fail unto them anything of all the things which <lb/>
            they desire to do. Come, let us go down and confuse their <lb/>
            language there, so that each may not understand the voice A <lb/>
            his neighbour. And the Lord scattered them from thence <lb/>
            over the face of all the earth, and they desisted from building <lb/>
            the city, and the tower. On this account, the name of it was <lb/>
            called Confusion, because there the Lord confused the languages <lb/>
            of all the earth, and from thence the Lord scattered them over <lb/>
            the face of all the earth."*</p>
          <p>IT. Those who are discontented at the constitution under <lb/>
            which their fathers have lived, being always eager to blame and <lb/>
            to accuse the laws, being impious men, use these and similar <lb/>
            instances as foundations for their impiety, saying, .. Are ye even <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xi 1. </note> <note type="footnote"> VOL. II. </note> <note type="footnote"> B </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="2"/>
            now speaking boastfully concerning your precepts, as if they <lb/>
            contained the rules of truth itself? For, behold, the books <lb/>
            which you call the sacred scriptures do also contain fables, at <lb/>
            which you are accustomed to laugh, when you hear others re­ <lb/>
            lating them." And what is the use of devoting our leisure to <lb/>
            collecting the fables interspersed in so many places throughout <lb/>
            the history of the giving of the law, as if we had especial leisure <lb/>
            for the consideration of calumnies, and as if it were not better <lb/>
            to attend merely to what is under our hands and before us ? <lb/>
            Certainly, this one fable resembles that which is composed <lb/>
            about the Aloadæ, who the greatest and most glorious of all <lb/>
            poets, Homer, says, had in contemplation to heap the three <lb/>
            loftiest mountains on one another, and to build them into one <lb/>
            mass, hoping that by this means there would be a road for <lb/>
            them, as they were desirous to mount up to heaven, and that <lb/>
            by these mountains it would be easy for them to be raised to <lb/>
            the height of the sky. And the verses of Homer on this sub­ <lb/>
            ject are these :— <lb/>
            High on Olympus' top they strove to raise <lb/>
            Gigantic Ossa; and on Ossa's heights <lb/>
            To place the leafy Pelion, that heaven <lb/>
            Might thus become accessible. <lb/>
            But Olympus and Ossa and Pelion are the names of moun­ <lb/>
            tains. But instead of these mountains the lawgiver represents <lb/>
            a tower as having been built by these men, who, out of igno­ <lb/>
            rance and wicked ambition, were desirous to reach the heaven. <lb/>
            Every alienation of mind, then, is grievous; for even if every <lb/>
            portion of the whole earth could he built over, a slight founda­ <lb/>
            tion being first laid, and then if a superstructure could be <lb/>
            raised in the fashion of a single pillar, it would still be an <lb/>
            enormous distance removed from the heavenly sphere, and <lb/>
            above all would it be so according to the tenets of those curious <lb/>
            philosophers who have affirmed that the earth is the centre of <lb/>
            the universe.</p>
          <p>III. And there is also another story akin to this, related by <lb/>
            the devisers of fables, concerning the sameness of language <lb/>
            existing among animals: for they say that formerly, all the <lb/>
            animals in the world, whether land animals, or aquatic ones. or <lb/>
            winged ones, had but one language, and that, just as among <lb/>
            men Greeks speak the same language as Greeks, and the <lb/>
            present race of barbarians speak the same language as barba­ <lb/>
             <pb n="3"/>
            flans, exactly in the same manner every animal was able to <lb/>
            converse with every other animal with which it might meet, <lb/>
            and with which it did anything, or from which it suffered any­ <lb/>
            thing. so that they sympathised with one another at their <lb/>
            mutual misfortunes, and rejoiced whenever any of them met <lb/>
            with any good fortune; for they could impart their pleasures <lb/>
            and their annoyances to one another by their sameness of lan­ <lb/>
            guage. so that they felt pleasure together and pain together; <lb/>
            and this similarity of manners and union of feelings lasted, <lb/>
            until being sated with the great abundance of good things <lb/>
            which they enjoyed, as often happens, they were at last drawn <lb/>
            on to a desire of what was unattainable, and even sent an em­ <lb/>
            bassy to treat for immortality, requesting to be released from <lb/>
            old age, and to be always endowed with the vigour of youth, <lb/>
            saying, that already one animal of their body, and that a rEp­ <lb/>
            tile, the serpent, bad received this gift; for he, having put off <lb/>
            old age. was allowed again to grow young; and that it was <lb/>
            absurd for the more important animals to be left behind by an <lb/>
            inferior one, or for their whole body to be distanced by one. <lb/>
            However, they suffered the punishment suitable to their auda­ <lb/>
            city, for they immediately were separated in their language, so <lb/>
            that, from that time forth, they have not been able to under­ <lb/>
            stand one another, by reason of the difference in the dialects <lb/>
            into which the one common language of them all had been <lb/>
            divided.</p>
          <p>IV. But he who brings his account nearer the truth, has dis­ <lb/>
            tinguished between the rational and irrational animals, so that <lb/>
            lie testifies that identity of language belonged to men alone : <lb/>
            and this also, as they say, is a fabulous story. And indeed <lb/>
            they affirm, that the separation of language into an infinite <lb/>
            variety of dialects, which Moses calls the confusion of tongues. <lb/>
            was effected as a remedy for sins, in order that men might not <lb/>
            be able to co-operate in common for deeds of wickedness through <lb/>
            understanding one another; and that they might not, when <lb/>
            they were in a manner deprived of all means of communica­ <lb/>
            tion with one another, be able with united energies to apply <lb/>
            themselves to the same actions. But this precaution does not <lb/>
            appear to have turned out of any use; for since that time, <lb/>
            though men have been separated into different nations, and <lb/>
            have no longer used one language, nevertheless, land and sea <lb/>
            have been repeatedly filled with unspeakable evils. <note type="footnote"> B 2 </note> <pb n="4"/>
            </p>
          <p>For it was -.t the languages which were the causes of men's <lb/>
            uniting for evil objects, but the emulation and rivalry of their <lb/>
            souls in wrong-doing. For even those who have had their <lb/>
            tongues cut out can intimate what they wish by nods and <lb/>
            looks, and other positions and motions of the body, not less <lb/>
            than by a distinct utterance of words. And besides this con­ <lb/>
            sideration, there is the fact that, very often, one nation by it­ <lb/>
            self, having not merely one language, but one code of laws, and <lb/>
            one system of manners, has arrived at such a pitch of iniquity <lb/>
            that, as to a superfluity of wickedness, it may counterbalance <lb/>
            the sins of all the men in the world put together. And again, <lb/>
            through ignorance of foreign languages, many persons, having <lb/>
            no foreknowledge of the future, have been anticipated and <lb/>
            overwhelmed by those who were plotting against them; as, on <lb/>
            the other hand, by knowledge of foreign languages, men have <lb/>
            been able to repel fears and dangers with which they have been <lb/>
            threatened ; so that a community of language is an advanta­ <lb/>
            geous thing rather than an injurious one : since, even at the <lb/>
            present day, nothing contributes so greatly to the safety and <lb/>
            protection of the people of each country, and particularly of the <lb/>
            natives, as their being of one language. For if a man has learnt <lb/>
            many dialects, he immediately is looked upon with considera­ <lb/>
            tion and respect by those who are also acquainted with them, <lb/>
            as being already a friendly person, and contributing no small <lb/>
            introduction and means of friendship by reason of his famili­ <lb/>
            arity with words which they too understand ; which familiarity <lb/>
            very commonly imparts a feeling of security, that one is not <lb/>
            likely to suffer any great evil at the hands of such a man. <lb/>
            Why, then, did God remove sameness of language from among <lb/>
            men as a cause of evils, when it seems it should rather have <lb/>
            been established as a most useful thing ?</p>
          <p>V. Those, then, who put these things together, and cavil at <lb/>
            them, and raise malicious objections, will be easily refuted <lb/>
            separately by those who can produce ready solutions of all such <lb/>
            questions as arise from the plain words of the law, arguing in a <lb/>
            spirit far from contentious, and not encountering them by <lb/>
            sophisms drawn from any other source, but following the con­ <lb/>
            nection of natural consequences, which does not permit them to <lb/>
            stumble, but which easily puts aside any impediments that <lb/>
            arise, so that the course of their arguments proceeds without <lb/>
            any interruption or mishap.</p><pb n="5"/>
            
          <p>We say then that by the expression, that an the earth had <lb/>
            but one pronunciation and one language," is intimated a sym­ <lb/>
            phony of great and unspeakable evils, which cities have in­ <lb/>
            flicted upon cities, nations upon nations, and countries upon <lb/>
            countries, and through which men not only wrong one another, <lb/>
            but also behave with impiety towards God, and yet these <lb/>
            things are the iniquities of many ; but let us consider the in­ <lb/>
            enable multitude of evils which proceed from each individual <lb/>
            man, and especially when he is under the influence of that <lb/>
            ill-timed, and inharmonious, and unmusical agreement.</p>
          <p>VI. Now who is there who does not know the great in­ <lb/>
            fluence of fortune, when men, in addition to the diseases or <lb/>
            mutilations of the body, are attacked also by poverty and want <lb/>
            of reputation ? And again, when these things are further <lb/>
            united to diseases of the soul, in consequence of moody <lb/>
            melancholy, driving men beside themselves, or of extreme <lb/>
            old age, or of any other severe calamity which presses upon <lb/>
            them ? For even one of these evils here mentioned by itself, <lb/>
            when it opposes a man with violence, is sufficient to overthrow <lb/>
            and to crush even one who is very proud and haughty; but <lb/>
            when all these evils, to wit, the evils of the body, and the <lb/>
            evils of the soul, and external misfortunes, all come together as <lb/>
            if in one regular battalion, moving by previous arrangement <lb/>
            at the same time, so as to attack him in one body, what reso­ <lb/>
            lution is there which they will not overpower? For when the <lb/>
            guards are slain, it follows of necessity that he who relies on <lb/>
            his guards must fall. Now the guards of the body are wealth, <lb/>
            glory, and honours, which set it up and raise it on high, and <lb/>
            make it proud, just as the contrary things, dishonour, want <lb/>
            of reputation, and poverty, throw it down like so many <lb/>
            enemies.</p>
          <p>Again, the body-guards of the soul are hearing, and seeing, <lb/>
            and smelling, and taste, and the whole band of the outward <lb/>
            senses, and also health, and strength, and vigour, and energy. <lb/>
            For the mind, when walking among and living in the company <lb/>
            of these things, as between well-fortified boundaries firmly <lb/>
            standing and solidly established, triumphs and rejoices, <lb/>
            meeting with no hindrance on any side to prevent it from <lb/>
            exerting its own impulses, but having its road in every direc­ <lb/>
            tion easy, and level, and open, and easy to be travelled. But <lb/>
            the things which are set in opposition and hostility to these <lb/>
             <pb n="6"/>
            guards are mutilation of the organs of the outward senses, and <lb/>
            disease, as I have said before, by which the mind is often pre­ <lb/>
            cipitated into disaster; and these things are all the results of <lb/>
            fortune, very grievous and intrinsically miserable, but still, if <lb/>
            compared with those which are brought on ourselves by our <lb/>
            own deliberate will, they are far lighter.</p>
          <p>VII. Let us now again in its turn consider what is the <lb/>
            united body of evils voluntarily incurred. Our soul being <lb/>
            capable of being divided into three divisions, one division is <lb/>
            said to have fallen to the lot of the mind and of reason, the <lb/>
            second to passion, and the third to appetite ; and each sepa­ <lb/>
            rate one of these has its own peculiar evils, and also they have <lb/>
            all common and mutual diseases. Since the mind reaps the <lb/>
            harvest which folly, and cowardice, and intemperance, and in­ <lb/>
            justice sow; and passion brings forth frantic and insane strife <lb/>
            and conflict, and all the other numerous evils with which it is <lb/>
            pregnant; and appetite disseminates in every direction the <lb/>
            impetuous and fickle loves of youth which descend upon every <lb/>
            object, animate or inanimate, which it chances to meet with. <lb/>
            For then, as if in any vessel, the sailors, and the passengers, <lb/>
            and the pilots, had all, under the influence of insanity, agreed <lb/>
            to destroy it, those who have joined in the plot against it are <lb/>
            none the less involved in the same destruction.</p>
          <p>For the heaviest of all evils, and almost the only one that is <lb/>
            incurable, is the unanimous energy of all the parts of the soul <lb/>
            agreeing to commit sin, not one of the parts being able to act <lb/>
            with soundness (just as is the case in an evil affecting the <lb/>
            whole people), so as to heal those that are sick ; but even the <lb/>
            physicians being diseased as well as their patients, whom the <lb/>
            pestilential disease has overwhelmed and weighs down under a <lb/>
            confessed calamity.</p>
          <p>Of this great evil, that great deluge described by the law­ <lb/>
            giver is an image; for the torrents from heaven continually <lb/>
            pouring down cataracts of wickedness itself with impetuous <lb/>
            violence, and springs from the ground (by which I mean the <lb/>
            body) continually bursting up and pouring forth streams of <lb/>
            every passion in great numbers and vast size, which, uniting <lb/>
            and being mingled in the same stream with the other <lb/>
            waters, are thrown into confusion, and overthrow the whole <lb/>
            region of the soul which has received them with incessant <lb/>
            eddies and whirlpools. "For," says Moses, "the Lord God, <lb/>
             <pb n="7"/>
            seeing that the wickedness of men were multiplied upon the <lb/>
            earth, and that every one did think continually in his heart <lb/>
            nothing but evil all his days, determined to punish mail " <lb/>
            (and here by man I understand the mind, together with all <lb/>
            the reptiles and winged creatures, and all the rest of the <lb/>
            multitude of wild animals which surround him), by reason of <lb/>
            his incurable wickedness; and the punishment which God <lb/>
            decided upon was the deluge. For there was unbounded free­ <lb/>
            dom in sinning, and unlimited licence in doing wrong, no one <lb/>
            hindering it, but all restraints being shamelessly broken down <lb/>
            in such a way that there was no fear left behind to restrain those <lb/>
            who were thoroughly ready to snatch at abundant supplies for <lb/>
            enjoyment of every kind. And may we not say that this was <lb/>
            natural ? For it was not only one portion of the soul which <lb/>
            was corrupted in such a way that it could still be preserved by <lb/>
            the sound condition of the other parts ; but there was no part <lb/>
            whatever of it which was left free from disease or from cor­ <lb/>
            ruption. For the incorruptible Judge, says Moses, seeing that <lb/>
            every thought of man's heart (not one single idea by itself) <lb/>
            was evil continually, inflicted upon him a deserved punishment.</p>
          <p>VIII. These are they who made a treaty with one another <lb/>
            in the valley of Salt."* For the region of the vices and of <lb/>
            the passions is a hollow valley, rough, and full of ravines; <lb/>
            truly salt, and producing bitter pains ; and their treaty, as one <lb/>
            that was not worthy of being confirmed by any oath or by any <lb/>
            libation, the wise Abraham, who knew the character of it, an­ <lb/>
            nulled. For it is said in the scripture that, " All these men <lb/>
            made a treaty at the valley of Salt, that is the sea of Salt." <lb/>
            Do you not perceive that they who are barren of wisdom and <lb/>
            blinded as to the intellect which it would be natural to expect <lb/>
            should be sharp-sighted, having the name of Sodomites from <lb/>
            their real character," did, with all their people united together, <lb/>
            from young to old, surround the house in a circle "t (that is <lb/>
            to say, the house of the soul), in order to pollute and con­ <lb/>
            taminate those strangers from a foreign land, who had been <lb/>
            received in hospitality, namely, sacred and holy reasons, the <lb/>
            guards and defenders of the soul; no one whatever attempting <lb/>
            either to resist those wrong doers, or to avoid doing wrong him­ <lb/>
            self? For Moses does not speak of some as having consented <lb/>
            and of others having stood aloof; but, as he says, “ The whole <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xiv. 3. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Genesis XIX. 4. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="8"/>
            people surrounded the house all together, both old and young," <lb/>
            having entered into a conspiracy against all those holy actions <lb/>
            and words which it is customary to call angels.</p>
          <p>IX. But Moses, the prophet of God, will meet them and <lb/>
            check them though they come on with exceeding boldness; <lb/>
            even though, placing in the front him who is the boldest and <lb/>
            the most forward and able speaker among them as their king, <lb/>
            namely speech, they rush on with one impulse, hoping to <lb/>
            increase their strength as they go on, and overflowing like a <lb/>
            river; " For behold," says Moses, " the king of Egypt is <lb/>
            coming to the water; but do thou go to meet him, and stand on <lb/>
            the bank of the river."* Therefore the wicked man goes <lb/>
            forth to the stream of iniquities and passions, and all collected <lb/>
            evils, which are here likened to water ; but the wise man first <lb/>
            obtains from God, who always stands firm, an honour akin to <lb/>
            his undeviating, and in all respects and under all circumstances, <lb/>
            unchangeable power; for we read in the scripture. “ But do <lb/>
            thou stand here with me, ”† that having laid aside doubt and <lb/>
            vacillation, the dispositions of an infirm soul, he may put on <lb/>
            that most steadfast and trustworthy disposition, faith. In the <lb/>
            next place, even while standing still, he (which seems a most <lb/>
            extraordinary thing) goes forward to meet him; for it is said <lb/>
            to him, .. Thou shalt stand meeting him," and yet to go to <lb/>
            meet is a part of motion, while to stand still is regarded as <lb/>
            characteristic of tranquillity.</p>
          <p>But the prophet does not here say things which are incon <lb/>
            sistent, but rather such as are exceedingly in accordance with <lb/>
            nature; for the man whose mind is naturally disposed to be <lb/>
            tranquil, and is established undeviatingly, must necessarily <lb/>
            be at variance with all those who delight in disorder and con­ <lb/>
            fusion, and who by artificial storms seek to disturb him who <lb/>
            is capable of enjoying tranquillity.</p>
          <p>X. It is very appropriately said that the meeting took place <lb/>
            on the bank of the river; but the banks are also called the <lb/>
            lips, and the lips are the boundaries of the mouth, and are a <lb/>
            sort of fence to the tongue, through which the stream of <lb/>
            discourse is borne, when it begins to be uttered ; but those <lb/>
            who hate virtue and who love learning, use speech as their ally <lb/>
            for the exposition of doctrines which are disapproved; and <lb/>
            again on the other hand, virtuous men employ it for the <note type="footnote"> * Exodus vii. 15. </note><note type="footnote"> t Deuteronomy v. 31. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="9"/>
            refutation of such doctrines, and for establishing the irresistible <lb/>
            strength of the better and true wisdom. When then, after <lb/>
            having had recourse to every expedient of contentious doctrines, <lb/>
            men are destroyed, being overwhelmed by the opposing violence <lb/>
            of contrary arguments, then the wise man will very justly and <lb/>
            suitably establish a most sacred chorus, and melodiously sing <lb/>
            a triumphal song; " For," says Moses, " Israel saw the <lb/>
            Egyptians," not dead in any other place, but "on the bank <lb/>
            (<foreign xml:lang="grc">χε̃ιλος</foreign>) of the river;"* meaning here by death, not the <lb/>
            separation of the soul from the body, but the impetuous onset <lb/>
            of unholy doctrines and assertions, which men utter by the <lb/>
            mouth, and tongue, and the other organs of speech.</p>
          <p>But the death of speech is silence, not that silence which <lb/>
            well-bred people cultivate, making it a symbol of modesty­ <lb/>
            for this silence is itself a faculty and a sister of that one which <lb/>
            is developed in speech, arranging what is to be said with <lb/>
            reference to time-but that silence which the sick and the <lb/>
            weary against their will endure, on account of the strength of <lb/>
            their antagonists, because they cannot find any handle to answer <lb/>
            them ; for whatever they touch slips away from them, and <lb/>
            whatever thing they seek to take their stand on does not <lb/>
            remain, so that they of necessity fall before they stand, like <lb/>
            that hydrostatic machine called the helix; for in the middle <lb/>
            of that engine there are some steps, which the husbandman <lb/>
            when he desires to water his fields mounts up upon, but is <lb/>
            rolled round of necessity, and in order to avoid falling he is <lb/>
            continually catching at the nearest firm thing that he can lay <lb/>
            his hands on, which he takes hold of and so supports his whole <lb/>
            body; for instead of his hands he uses his feet, and instead <lb/>
            of his feet he uses his hands; for he stands on his hands, <lb/>
            by means of which, actions are usually done, and he acts with <lb/>
            his feet on which it is natural to stand.</p>
          <p>XI. But many, who are not able vigorously to refute the <lb/>
            plausible inventions of the sophists, because they have not <lb/>
            very much practised discussion by reason of their continued <lb/>
            application to action, have taken refuge in the alliance of the <lb/>
            only wise Being, and have besought him to become their <lb/>
            defender. As one of the friends of Moses, when praying, says <lb/>
            in his hymns, " Let the treacherous lips become mute ;”† and <lb/>
            how can they become mute if they are not curbed by the only <note type="footnote"> * Exodus xiv. 30. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Psalm xxx. 19. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="10"/>
            being who has speech itself as his subject ? We must therefore <lb/>
            flee, without ever turning back, from all associations entered <lb/>
            into for the purposes of sin ; but the alliance made with the <lb/>
            companions of wisdom and knowledge must be confirmed. In <lb/>
            reference to which I admire those who say, " We are all one <lb/>
            man's sons, we are men of peace,"* because of their well-adapted <lb/>
            agreement; since how, I should say, could you, 0 excellent men, <lb/>
            avoid being grieved at war, and delighted in peace, being the <lb/>
            sons of one and the same father, and he not mortal but im­ <lb/>
            mortal, the man of God, who being the reason of the ever­ <lb/>
            lasting God, is of necessity himself also immortal ?</p>
          <p>For they who make out many beginnings of the origin of <lb/>
            the soul, being devoted to the evil which is called polytheism, <lb/>
            and turning each individual of them, to the honour of different <lb/>
            beings, have caused great confusion and dissension both at <lb/>
            home and abroad, from the beginning of their birth to the end of <lb/>
            their life, filling life with irreconcilable quarrels; but they <lb/>
            who rejoice in one kind alone, and who honour one as their <lb/>
            father, namely right reason, admiring the well-arranged and <lb/>
            all-musical harmony of the virtues, live a tranquil and peaceful <lb/>
            life, not an inactive and ignoble one, as some persons think, <lb/>
            but one of great manliness, and sharpened, and vigorous <lb/>
            against those who endeavour to break the confederacy which <lb/>
            they have formed, and who are always studying to bring about <lb/>
            a violation of the oaths which have been taken; for it has come <lb/>
            to pass that the men of peace have become men of war, sitting <lb/>
            down to attack and to oppose those who seek to overturn the <lb/>
            firmness of the soul.</p>
          <p>XII. And there is testimony in support of this assertion of <lb/>
            mine ; first of all, in the disposition of every lover of virtue <lb/>
            which acknowledges these inclinations; and secondly, in that <lb/>
            comrade of the band of the prophets, who being inspired with <lb/>
            it sacred frenzy, spoke thus, “ 0 my mother, how hast thou <lb/>
            brought me forth, a man of war, and a mail of disquietude to all <lb/>
            the earth! I have not benefited them, and they have not <lb/>
            benefited me; nor is my strength free from their curses."t <lb/>
            But is not every wise man of necessity an irreconcilable <lb/>
            enemy to all wicked men, not indeed using the apparatus of <lb/>
            triremes or warlike engines, or arms, or soldiers, for his defence, <lb/>
            but reasons ? For when he sees war stirred up in the midst <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xlii. 11. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Jeremiah xv. 10. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="11"/>
            of tranquil peace, so as to be continued and incessant among <lb/>
            all men, both public and private, not existing only among <lb/>
            nations and countries, and cities and villages, but also in every <lb/>
            house, and between each particular individual; who is there <lb/>
            who does not reproach and admonish and seek to correct the <lb/>
            foolish men whom lie sees, and not by day only. but also by <lb/>
            night, his soul being unable to remain tranquil by reason of <lb/>
            the hatred of wickedness implanted in his nature ?</p>
          <p>For they do in peace every thing that is done in war ; they <lb/>
            plunder, they ravage, they drag into slavery, they carry oil <lb/>
            booty, they lay waste, they behave insolently, they assault, they <lb/>
            destroy, they pollute, they murder treacherously, they murder <lb/>
            openly if they are the more powerful; for every one of them, <lb/>
            proposing to himself riches or glory as his object, aims all <lb/>
            the actions of his life as so many arrows at it, and neglects <lb/>
            equality, and pursues inequality, and repudiates associations, <lb/>
            and labours to acquire to himself all the possessions together <lb/>
            properly belonging to every one; he is a misanthrope and a <lb/>
            hater of all his fellows, making a hypocritical pretence of <lb/>
            benevolence, being a companion of a bastard kind of flattery, <lb/>
            an enemy of genuine friendship, a foe to truth, a champion of <lb/>
            falsehood, slow to do good, swift to do injury, very ready to <lb/>
            calumniate, very slow to defend, clever at deceiving, most per­ <lb/>
            jured, most faithless, a slave of anger, yielding to pleasure, a <lb/>
            guardian of all that is evil, a destroyer of all that is good.</p>
          <p>XIII. These and other similar gifts are the most desirable <lb/>
            treasures of peace, that blessing so celebrated and so admired, <lb/>
            which the mind of each individual among the foolish men sets <lb/>
            up for itself as an image, and admires and worships; at <lb/>
            whom, very naturally, every wise man is grieved, and is accus­ <lb/>
            tomed to say to his mother and nurse, wisdom, " 0 mother, <lb/>
            what a person hast thou brought me forth!" not in strength <lb/>
            of body, but in energy and courage, a determined hater of <lb/>
            wickedness, a man of disquietude and battle, by nature peace­ <lb/>
            ful, and, on this very account, an enemy to those who pollute <lb/>
            the desirable beauty of peace. " I have done no good to them, <lb/>
            nor have they done any good to me ;” nor have they even de­ <lb/>
            rived any advantage from my good things, nor have I from <lb/>
            their evil things; but according to the word of Moses, " I <lb/>
            have received no desirable thing from any one of them,"* iu­ <note type="footnote"> * Numbers xvi. 15. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="12"/>
            asmuch as I look upon as exceedingly pernicious every object <lb/>
            of their desire, which they treasure up in their hearts as the <lb/>
            greatest possible advantage; " Nor has my strength failed by <lb/>
            reason of the curses which they laid upon me;"* but em­ <lb/>
            bracing the divine doctrines with my most earnest power, I <lb/>
            was not wearied so as to give up, but rather I vigorously re­ <lb/>
            proached those who cursed me from their hearts.</p>
          <p>For God made us to be a contradiction to our neighbours, <lb/>
            as is said In my hymns, meaning all of us who aim at right <lb/>
            reason: but are not all those people naturally fond of contra­ <lb/>
            dictiou who have a zeal for knowledge and virtue, being always <lb/>
            at variance with the neighbours of their soul, reproving the <lb/>
            pleasures which live in union with them, and reproving the <lb/>
            appetites which have the same abode, and looking morosely at <lb/>
            acts of cowardice and fear, and the whole body of passions and <lb/>
            vices ?</p>
          <p>Reproving then every outward sense, the eyes for what they <lb/>
            saw, and the ears for what they heard, and the sense of smell <lb/>
            for the smells that presented themselves to it, the taste for <lb/>
            the flavours which were subjected to it, aud moreover the <lb/>
            touch for its various powers developed in the body, with refer­ <lb/>
            ence to the peculiarities which come under its notice; and <lb/>
            even uttered speech for the matters which it may have chosen <lb/>
            to discuss; for what the outward seuse has perceived, or how <lb/>
            it has done so, or why, or what speech has uttered, or how or <lb/>
            why, or in what manner, and how and why passion has dis­ <lb/>
            posed men, it is worth while to investigate in no superficial <lb/>
            manner, and to examine each of the errors iuto which they <lb/>
            fall; but he who contradicts none of these things, but who <lb/>
            assents to every one of them iu succession, without being <lb/>
            aware of it, is deceiving himself, and building up troublesome <lb/>
            neighbours for his soul, which he had better have as subjects <lb/>
            than as rulers; for as rulers they will do him manifold and <lb/>
            great injury, since folly reigns among them; but as subjects <lb/>
            they will serve him obediently in suitable matters, and will <lb/>
            not at all raise their heads in arrogauce, as they will if they <lb/>
            are rulers.</p>
          <p>Thus, indeed, while some are learning to be subjects, and <lb/>
            others are obtaining authority, not by knowledge only but also <lb/>
            by power, all the body-guards and champions of the soul, that <note type="footnote"> Psalm lxxix. 7. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="13"/>
            is to say, its reasonings will keep them in order, and coming <lb/>
            to that which is most important among them will say, " Thy <lb/>
            children have taken the sum of the men that are warriors <lb/>
            among us, and there is not one of them who has disagreed;"* <lb/>
            but like musical instruments, skilfully tuned in all their tones, <lb/>
            so we sound in harmony in all our explanations, neither utter­ <lb/>
            ing any word nor doing any action which shall be unmelodious <lb/>
            or discordant, that we may by the contrast show, that' the <lb/>
            other company of unlettered men is, in all respects, voiceless <lb/>
            and dead, and an object of deserved ridicule, namely, that <lb/>
            nourishment of the corporeal parts, Midian, and that his off­ <lb/>
            spring too, that mass of skins, whose name is Belphegor, is <lb/>
            asleep; “ for we are of the race of picked men of Israel, that <lb/>
            sees God, of whom not one has disagreed; ”† that the instru <lb/>
            ment of the universe, the whole world, may be melodiously <lb/>
            sounded in musical harmony.</p>
          <p>On this account Moses says that the " reward of peace ” ‡ was <lb/>
            given to the very war-like reason, which is called Phinehas; <lb/>
            because, having received a zeal for virtue, and having taken <lb/>
            up war against vice, he cut up the whole of generation; and <lb/>
            in the second place, to all those who are willing, after a careful <lb/>
            examination and investigation, using their eyes in preference <lb/>
            to their ears as a trustworthy witness, to believe that the human <lb/>
            race is full of infidelity, depending solely on opinion. There­ <lb/>
            fore the afore-mentioned agreement is admirable; and most <lb/>
            admirable of all is that common one which exceeds all the <lb/>
            harmonies of all the others, according to which the whole <lb/>
            people is represented as saying with one accord, “ All the <lb/>
            things which God has spoken, we will obey and do.”§ For <lb/>
            these men no longer obey reason as their ruler, but God, the <lb/>
            governor of the universe, by whom they are assisted so as to <lb/>
            display their energies in actions rather than in words. For <lb/>
            when they hear of others doing such and such things, these <lb/>
            men, which is a thing most contrary to what one would expect, <lb/>
            say that, from some inspiration of God, they will act first and <lb/>
            obey afterwards; in order that they may seem to have advanced <lb/>
            to good actions, not in consequence of instruction and admoni­ <lb/>
            tion, but by their own spontaneous and self-taught mind. And <lb/>
            then, when they have accomplished these actions, they say <note type="footnote"> * Numbers xxxi. 49. </note><note type="footnote"> I Numbers xxv. 12. </note> <note type="footnote"> + Exodus xxiv. 11. </note><note type="footnote"> § Deuteronomy v. 27. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="14"/>
            that they will obey in order that they may form an opinion of <lb/>
            what they have done, as to whether their actions are consistent <lb/>
            with the divine injunctions and the sacred admonitions of scrip­ <lb/>
            ture.</p>
          <p>XIV. But those who conspired to commit injustice, he says, <lb/>
            “ having come from the east, found a plain in the land of <lb/>
            Shinar, and dwelt there ; "* speaking most strictly in accord­ <lb/>
            ance with nature. For there is a twofold kind of dawning in <lb/>
            the soul, the one of a better sort, the other of a worse. That <lb/>
            is the better sort, when the light of the virtues shines forth like <lb/>
            the beams of the sun ; and that is the worse kind, when they <lb/>
            are overshadowed, and the vices show forth. Now, the follow­ <lb/>
            ing is an example of the former kind: " And God planted a <lb/>
            paradise in Eden, toward the east," t not of terrestrial but of <lb/>
            celestial plants, which the planter caused to spring up from <lb/>
            the incorporeal light which exists around him, in such a way <lb/>
            as to be for ever inextinguishable.</p>
          <p>I have also heard of one of the companions of Moses having <lb/>
            uttered such a speech as this : " Behold, a nail whose name is <lb/>
            the East! " ‡ A very novel appellation indeed, if you consider <lb/>
            it as spoken of a man who is compounded of body and soul; <lb/>
            but if you look upon it as applied to that incorporeal being who <lb/>
            in no respect differs from the divine image, you will then agree <lb/>
            that the name of the east has been given to him with great <lb/>
            felicity. For the Father of the universe has caused him to <lb/>
            spring up as the eldest son, whom, in another passage, he calls <lb/>
            the firstborn ; and he who is thus born, imitating the ways of <lb/>
            his father, has formed such and such species, looking to his <lb/>
            archetypal patterns.</p>
          <p>XV. But an example of the worse kind of dawning is <lb/>
            afforded by the words used by the man who was willing “to <lb/>
            curse the people who were blessed by God.” § For he also is <lb/>
            represented as dwelling in the east. And this dawning, having <lb/>
            the same name as the former one, has nevertheless an opposite <lb/>
            nature to it, and is continually at war with it. For Balaam <lb/>
            says, " Balak sent for me out of Mesopotamia, from the <lb/>
            mountains of the east, saying, Come, curse me the people <lb/>
            whom God doth not curse." But the name of Balak, being <lb/>
            interpreted means, " void of sense; " a very felicitous name. <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xi. 2. </note><note type="footnote"> ‡ Zechariah vi. 12. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Genesis ii. S. </note><note type="footnote"> § Numbers xxiii. 7. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="15"/>
            For how can it be otherwise than shocking to hope to deceive <lb/>
            the living God, and to turn aside his most enduring and firmly <lb/>
            established counsels by the sophistical devices of men ? On <lb/>
            this account he is represented as living in Mesopotamia, for <lb/>
            his mind is overwhelmed as in the middle of the depth of the <lb/>
            river, and is not able to emerge and to swim away. And this <lb/>
            condition is the dawning of folly and the setting of sound <lb/>
            reason.</p>
          <p>They, then, who are tuned in an inharmonious symphony <lb/>
            are said to be moved from the east. Is this, then, the east <lb/>
            according to wickedness ? But the dawning in accordance <lb/>
            with virtue is described as a complete separation, and the <lb/>
            motion from the dawning according to vice is a united one, as <lb/>
            when the hands are moved, not separately and disjunctively, <lb/>
            but in a certain harmony and connection with the whole body. <lb/>
            For folly is to the wicked man the beginning of his energy in <lb/>
            the works which are contrary to nature, that is, of his approach <lb/>
            to the region of wickedness. But all those who have quitted <lb/>
            the region of virtue, and have set forth to go over to folly, <lb/>
            have found a most appropriate place in which they dwell, <lb/>
            which is called in the Hebrew language Shinar. And Shinar <lb/>
            in Greek, is called " shaking ;” for the whole life of the wicked <lb/>
            is shaken, and agitated, and torn to pieces, being always kept <lb/>
            in a state of commotion and confusion, and having no trace of <lb/>
            any genuine good laid up in itself. For as everything which <lb/>
            is not held together by close union, falls out of what'is <lb/>
            violently shaken, in the very same manner, it seems to me, <lb/>
            that the soul is shaken of every man who associates with <lb/>
            others for the purpose of doing wrong; for he casts away <lb/>
            every appearance of good, so that no shadow or image of it <lb/>
            ever appears.</p>
          <p>XVI. Accordingly, the body-loving race of the Egyptians <lb/>
            is represented as fleeing, not from the water, but " under the <lb/>
            water," that is to say, beneath the impetuous speed of the <lb/>
            passions. And when it has once placed itself under the power <lb/>
            of the passions, it is shaken and agitated; it casts away the <lb/>
            stable and peaceful qualities of virtue, and takes up in their <lb/>
            stead the turbulent and confused character of wickedness; for <lb/>
            it is said that " God shook the Egyptians in the middle <lb/>
            of the sea, fleeing under the water." * These are they who <note type="footnote"> * Exodus xiv. 27. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="16"/>
            neither knew Joseph—the diversified pride of life — but <lb/>
            who, having their sins revealed, have not received any trace, or <lb/>
            shade, or image of goodness and excellence. For, says Moses, <lb/>
            “ Another king arose over the Egyptians who knew not <lb/>
            Joseph,"* the latest and most modern good perceptible by the <lb/>
            outward senses, who utterly destroyed not only the perfections <lb/>
            but even all improvements, and all the energy which can be <lb/>
            exerted by the sight, and all the teaching which can be im­ <lb/>
            planted by means of the hearing, saying, " Come, curse me <lb/>
            Jacob ; and come, defy Israel for me t an expression which is <lb/>
            equivalent to, Destroy both these things, the sight and the <lb/>
            hearing of the soul, that it may neither see nor hear any true <lb/>
            and genuine good thing; for Israel is the emblem of seeing <lb/>
            and Jacob of hearing. Accordingly the mind of such persons <lb/>
            rejects the whole nature of good, being in some degree shaken; <lb/>
            and, on the other hand. the mind of good persons, setting up <lb/>
            a claim to the unmingled and unalloyed ideas of good things, <lb/>
            shakes off and discards all that is evil.</p>
          <p>Consider, therefore, what the practiser of virtue says : <lb/>
            " Take up the foreign gods that are among you from out of <lb/>
            the midst of you, and purify yourselves, and change your <lb/>
            garments, and rise up and let us go to Bethel; ”‡ in order that, <lb/>
            even if Laban should demand a power of examining, the <lb/>
            images might not be found in his whole house, but only such <lb/>
            things as have a real subsistence and essence, being fixed like <lb/>
            pillars in the mind of the wise man, which the self-taught <lb/>
            offspring Isaac has received as his inheritance ; for he alone <lb/>
            receives his father's substance as his inheritance.” §</p>
          <p>XVII. And take notice that Moses does not say that they <lb/>
            came unto a plain in which they remain, but that they “ found ’ <lb/>
            one, having searched around in every direction, and having <lb/>
            considered what might be the most suitable region for folly; <lb/>
            for in reality every foolish mail does not take from another for <lb/>
            himself, but he seeks for and finds evils, not being content <lb/>
            only with those which wicked nature proceeds towards of its <lb/>
            own accord, but also adding thereto such perfect skill in evil <lb/>
            as arises from constant practice in contriving wrong. And I <lb/>
            wish indeed that after he had remained there a brief time he <lb/>
            had changed his abode ; but even now he thinks fit to remain, <note type="footnote"> * Exodus i. 8. </note><note type="footnote"> t Genesis XXXV. 2. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Numbers xxiii. 7 </note><note type="footnote"> § Genesis xxv. 5. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="17"/>
            for it is said that having found the plain they dwelt there; <lb/>
            having settled there as if in their own country and not as if in <lb/>
            a foreign land; for it would have been less terrible for men <lb/>
            who had fallen in with wicked actions to look upon them as <lb/>
            strange and foreign to them, and not to consider that they had <lb/>
            any kindred or connection with them. For if they had looked <lb/>
            upon themselves as sojourners among them, they would have <lb/>
            changed their abode at a subsequent time, but now having <lb/>
            settled fixedly among them they were likely to dwell there for <lb/>
            ever.</p>
          <p>For this reason all the wise men mentioned in the books of <lb/>
            Moses are represented as sojourners, for their souls are sent <lb/>
            down from heaven upon earth as to a colony; and on account <lb/>
            of their fondness for contemplation, and their love of learning, <lb/>
            they are accustomed to migrate to the terrestrial nature. Since <lb/>
            therefore having taken up their abode among bodies, they <lb/>
            behold all the mortal objects of the outward senses by their <lb/>
            means, they then subsequently return back from thence to <lb/>
            the place from which they set out at first, looking upon the <lb/>
            heavenly country in which they have the rights of citizens as <lb/>
            their native land, and as the earthly abode in which they dwell <lb/>
            for a while as in a foreign land.</p>
          <p>For to those who are sent to be the inhabitants of a colony, the <lb/>
            country which has received them is in place of their original <lb/>
            mother country ; but still the land which has sent them forth <lb/>
            remains to them as the house to which they desire to return. <lb/>
            Therefore, very naturally, Abraham says to the guardians of <lb/>
            the dead and to the arrangers of mortal affairs, after he has <lb/>
            forsaken that life which is only dead and the tomb, " I am a <lb/>
            stranger and a sojourner among you, "* but ye are natives of <lb/>
            the country, honouring the dust and earth more than the soul, <lb/>
            thinking the name Ephron worthy of precedence, for Ephron, <lb/>
            being interpreted, means " a mound " and naturally, Jacob, the <lb/>
            practiser of virtue, bewails his being a sojourner in the body, <lb/>
            saying, “ The days of the years of my life which I spend here as <lb/>
            a sojourner have been few and evil; they have not come up to <lb/>
            the days of my fathers which they spent as sojourners.”† <lb/>
            But to him who was self-taught the following injunction of <lb/>
            scripture was given, " Do not go down, " says the scripture, " to <lb/>
            Egypt," that is to say to passion; "but dwell in this land <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xxiii. 4. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Genesis xlvii. 9. </note> <note type="footnote"> VOL. II. </note> <note type="footnote"> c </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="18"/>
            land which I will tell thee of, "* namely, in the incorporeal <lb/>
            wisdom which cannot be pointed out to the eye; and be a <lb/>
            sojourner in this land, the substance which can be pointed out <lb/>
            and appreciated by the external sense. And this is said with a <lb/>
            view to show, that the wise man is a sojourner in a foreign <lb/>
            land, that is to say in the body perceptible by the outward <lb/>
            senses, who dwells among the virtues appreciable by the <lb/>
            intellect as in his native land, which virtues God utters as in <lb/>
            no way differing from the divine word. But Moses says, " I <lb/>
            am a sojourner in a foreign land ; " speaking with peculiar <lb/>
            fitness, looking upon his abode in the body not only as a <lb/>
            foreign land, as sojourners do, but also as a land from which <lb/>
            one ought to feel alienated, and never look upon it as one's <lb/>
            home.</p>
          <p>XVIII. But the wicked man, desiring to exhibit the fact that <lb/>
            identity of language, and the sameness of dialect does not consist <lb/>
            more in names and common words than in his participation in <lb/>
            iniquitous actions, begins to build a city and a tower as a <lb/>
            citadel for sovereign wickedness; and he invites all his fellow <lb/>
            revellers to partake in his enterprise, preparing beforehand <lb/>
            abundance of suitable materials. For, " Come, " says he, “ let <lb/>
            us make bricks, and let us bake them in the fire," an expression <lb/>
            equivalent to, Now we have all the parts of the soul mingled <lb/>
            together and in a state of confusion, so that there is no species <lb/>
            whatever the form of which is evident to be seen. Therefore it <lb/>
            will be consistent with these beginnings that, as we have <lb/>
            assumed a certain essence destitute of all particular species; <lb/>
            and of all distinctive qualities, and have also taken up with <lb/>
            passion and vice, we should also divide it into suitable qualities, <lb/>
            and keep on reducing the proximate to the ultimate species ; <lb/>
            and with a view to the more distinct comprehension of them, <lb/>
            and also to this employment and enjoyment of them combined <lb/>
            with experience, which appears to produce many pleasures and <lb/>
            delights.</p>
          <p>Come, therefore, all ye reasonings of counsellors, in some way <lb/>
            or the other to the assembly of the soul; come, all ye who <lb/>
            meditate the destruction of justice and of all virtue, and let us <lb/>
            consider carefully how we may attain to the end which we <lb/>
            desire. Now of success in this matter these will be the most <lb/>
            established foundations: to give to things without form shape <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xxvi. 9 </note> <note type="footnote">t Exodus ii. 29. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="19"/>
            and character, and to distinguish each thing separately with <lb/>
            distinct outlines, lest, if they become shaken and lame (though <lb/>
            fixed on firm foundations.) and if they have assumed a con­ <lb/>
            nection with the nature of a quadrangular shape, (for this is a <lb/>
            nature always unshaken), they may then, being established <lb/>
            steadily like a building of brick, support even those things which <lb/>
            are built upon them.</p>
          <p>XIX. Of such a structure as this every mind adverse to <lb/>
            God, which we call the king of Egypt (that is to say of the <lb/>
            body), is found to be the maker. For Moses represents the <lb/>
            mind as rejoicing in the buildings made of brick; for after <lb/>
            some being or other made the two substances of water and <lb/>
            earth to be the one dry and the other solid, and mingling the <lb/>
            two together, for they were easily dissoluble and corruptible, <lb/>
            made a third substance to be on the confines of the two, which <lb/>
            is called clay, he has never ceased from dissecting this into <lb/>
            small portions, giving its own appropriate figure to each of the <lb/>
            fragments, in order that they might be very well compacted <lb/>
            together, and very suitable to the objects for which they were <lb/>
            intended. For in this way what was being made was sure to <lb/>
            be very easily perfected.</p>
          <p>Imitating this work, those men who are wicked in their <lb/>
            natures, when they mingle the irrational and extravagant im­ <lb/>
            pulses of the passions with the most grievous vices, are, in <lb/>
            reality, dissecting that which has been combined into various <lb/>
            species, and unhappy that they are fashioning them again and <lb/>
            reducing them into shape, by means of which the blockade of <lb/>
            the soul will be raised on high; these being, in fact, the divi­ <lb/>
            sions of the outward sense into seeing, and hearing, and taste, <lb/>
            and smell, and touch. Passion, again, is divided into pleasure. <lb/>
            and appetite, and fear, and grief; and the universal genus of <lb/>
            vices is divided into folly, and intemperance, and cowardice, <lb/>
            and injustice, and all the other vices which are akin to or closely <lb/>
            connected with them.</p>
          <p>XX. And before now some persons, even more excessively <lb/>
            extravagant in wickedness than these, have not only prepared <lb/>
            their own souls for such actions, but have also put a force upon <lb/>
            those of a superior class and of the genus which is endowed <lb/>
            with acuteness of vision, and have " compelled them to make <lb/>
            bricks and to build strong cities" * for the mind, which has ap­ <note type="footnote"> * Exodus i. 11. </note> <note type="footnote"> c 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="20"/>
            peared to occupy the place of king, wishing to point out this fact, <lb/>
            that what is good is the slave of what is evil, and that subjec­ <lb/>
            tion to the passions is more powerful than tranquillity of soul, and <lb/>
            prudence, and all virtue is, but, as it were, a subject of folly and <lb/>
            all wickedness, so as of necessity to minister in all the matters <lb/>
            which the master power enjoins ; for behold, says Moses, the <lb/>
            most pure, and brilliant, and far-sighted eye of the soul, to <lb/>
            which alone it is permitted to behold God, by name Israel, <lb/>
            being formerly bound in the corporeal nets of Egypt, endures <lb/>
            severe commands, so as to be compelled to make bricks and all <lb/>
            sorts of things of clay with the most grievous and intolerable <lb/>
            labours, at which it is very naturally pained, and at which it <lb/>
            groans, having laid up this, as it were, to be its only treasure <lb/>
            amid its evils, the power of bewailing its present distresses.</p>
          <p>For it is said, very correctly, that " the children of Israel <lb/>
            groaned by reason of their tasks."* And what man in his <lb/>
            senses is there who, if he saw the tasks of the generality of <lb/>
            men, and the exceeding earnestness with which they labour at <lb/>
            the pursuits to which they are accustomed to devote them­ <lb/>
            selves, whether it be the acquisition of money, or glory, or the <lb/>
            enjoyment of pleasure, would not be greatly concerned and cry <lb/>
            out to God, the only Saviour, that he would lighten their <lb/>
            labours, and pay a ransom and price for the salvation of the <lb/>
            soul, so as to emancipate and deliver it?</p>
          <p>What, then, is the surest freedom ? The service of the only <lb/>
            wise God, as the scriptures testify, in which it is said, " Send <lb/>
            forth the people, that they may serve me.”† But it is a pecu­ <lb/>
            liar property of those who serve the living God neither to <lb/>
            regard the works of cup-bearers, or bakers, or cooks, or any <lb/>
            other earthly employments, nor to trouble themselves about <lb/>
            arranging or adorning their bodies like bricks, but to mount up <lb/>
            with their reason to the height of heaven, having elected Moses, <lb/>
            the type of the race which loves God, to be the guide of their <lb/>
            path ; for then they will see the place which is visible,”‡ on <lb/>
            which the unchangeable and unalterable God stands; and the <lb/>
            footstool beneath his feet, which is, as it were, a work of <lb/>
            sapphire stone, and, as it were, a resemblance to the firmament <lb/>
            of heaven, namely, the world perceptible by the outward <lb/>
            senses, which he describes allegorically by these figures. For <lb/>
            it is very suitable for those who have made an association for <note type="footnote"> * Exodus ii. 23. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Exodus viii. 1. </note> <note type="footnote"> ‡ Exodus xxiv. 10. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="21"/>
            the purpose of learning to desire to see him; and, if they are <lb/>
            unable to do that, at least to see his image, the most sacred <lb/>
            word, and, next to that, the most perfect work of all the things <lb/>
            perceptible by the outward senses, namely, the world ? For to <lb/>
            philosophise is nothing else but to desire to see these things <lb/>
            accurately.</p>
          <p>XXI. But he says that the world perceptible to the outward <lb/>
            senses is, as it were, the footstool of God on this account: <lb/>
            first of all, that he may show that there is no efficient cause in <lb/>
            the creatures; secondly, for the purpose of displaying that <lb/>
            even the whole world has not a free and unrestrained sponta­ <lb/>
            neous motion of its own, hut God, the ruler of the universe, <lb/>
            takes his stand upon it, regulating it and directing everything <lb/>
            in a saving manner by the helm of his wisdom, using, in truth, <lb/>
            neither hands nor feet, nor any other part whatever such as <lb/>
            belongs to created objects; for God is not as man, but the <lb/>
            reason why we at times represent him as such, for the sake of <lb/>
            instruction, is because we are unable to advance out of our­ <lb/>
            selves, but derive our apprehension of the uncreate God from <lb/>
            the circumstances with which we ourselves are surrounded.</p>
          <p>And it is very beautifully said by Moses, in the form of a <lb/>
            parable, when he speaks of the world as if it resembled a brick; <lb/>
            for the world appears to stand and to be firmly fixed like a <lb/>
            brick in a house, as far as the vision of the sight of the outward <lb/>
            senses can inform us, but- it has a very swift motion, and one <lb/>
            which is able to outstrip all particular motions. For the eyes <lb/>
            of our body look upon the appearance of the sun by day and of <lb/>
            the moon by night as standing still, and yet who is there who <lb/>
            does not know that the rapidity of movements of these two <lb/>
            bodies is incomparable, since they go round the whole heaven <lb/>
            in one day ? Thus, indeed, the universal heaven itself also, <lb/>
            while appearing to stand still, revolves in a circle ; its move­ <lb/>
            ment being detected and comprehended by the invisible and <lb/>
            more divine eye which is placed in our mind.</p>
          <p>XXII. And they are represented as baking the bricks in the <lb/>
            fire, for the purpose of intimating by this symbolical expression <lb/>
            that they are strengthened and hardened as to their vices and <lb/>
            their passions by warm and most energetic reason, so that they <lb/>
            can never be overthrown by the body-guards of wisdom, by <lb/>
            whom engines for their defeat are being continually put in <lb/>
            operation. Oil which account we have this further statement <lb/>
             <pb n="22"/>
            also made, " Their brick was to them for stone;" for the weak <lb/>
            and lax character of that impetuosity which is not in company <lb/>
            with reason, when it is closely pressed and condensed so as to <lb/>
            assume a nature capable of solidity and resistance, owes this <lb/>
            change to powerful reasons and most convincing demonstrations ; <lb/>
            the comprehension of such speculations being, in a manner, <lb/>
            endowed with manliness and vigour, which comprehensions, <lb/>
            while in a tender age, melt away by reason of the mixture of <lb/>
            the soul, which is not as yet able to consolidate and preserve <lb/>
            the character impressed upon it.</p>
          <p>" And they had slime for mortar;" not, on the contrary, <lb/>
            mortar for slime. For the wicked appear to strengthen and <lb/>
            fortify what is weak against what is more powerful, and from <lb/>
            their own resources to consolidate and preserve what melts and <lb/>
            flows away from such things, in order that they may aim and <lb/>
            shoot at virtue from a safe place. But the merciful God and <lb/>
            father of the good will not permit their buildings to be esta. <lb/>
            blished in indissoluble safety, their work of melting zeal not <lb/>
            being able to withstand, but becoming like soft mud.</p>
          <p>For, if their clay had become mortar, then perchance that <lb/>
            earthy thing perceptible by the outward senses, which is for <lb/>
            ever and ever in a continued state of flux, would have been <lb/>
            able to arrive at a safe and unalterable power; but since, on <lb/>
            the contrary, their mortar became mere slime, we must not <lb/>
            despair, for there is in this, certain hope that the strong forti­ <lb/>
            fications of vice may be overthrown by the might of God. <lb/>
            Therefore the just man, even in the great and incessant deluge <lb/>
            of life, while lie is not as yet able to see things really as they <lb/>
            are by the energy of his soul alone without the assistance of the <lb/>
            outward sense, will anoint " the ark," by which I understand <lb/>
            the body, "both within and without with pitch,"* strength­ <lb/>
            ening his imaginations and energies by his own resources ; but <lb/>
            when the danger has ceased and the violence of the flood <lb/>
            abated, then he will come forth, availing himself of his incor­ <lb/>
            poreal mind for the comprehension of truth.</p>
          <p>For the good disposition being from the very birth of the <lb/>
            man planted in virtue, and being spoken of as such, its name <lb/>
            being Moses, dwelling in the whole world as his native city <lb/>
            and country, becoming, as it were, a cosmopolite, being bound <lb/>
            up in the body, smeared over as with " bitumen and pitch,”† <note type="footnote"> * Genesis vi. 14. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Exodus ii. 3. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="23"/>
            and appearing to be able to receive and to contain in security <lb/>
            all the imaginations of all things which might be subjected to <lb/>
            the outward senses, weeps* at being so bound up, being over­ <lb/>
            whelmed with a desire for an incorporeal nature. And he <lb/>
            weeps over the miserable mind of men in general as being <lb/>
            wandering and puffed up with pride, inasmuch as, being elated <lb/>
            with false opinion, it thinks that it has in itself something <lb/>
            firm and safe, and, as a general fact, that there something im­ <lb/>
            mutable in some creature or other, though the example of <lb/>
            perpetual stability, which is at all times the same, is set up in <lb/>
            God alone.</p>
          <p>XXIII. And the expression, " Come, and let us build our­ <lb/>
            selves a city and a tower, the top of which shall reach to <lb/>
            heaven," has such a meaning as this concealed beneath it: the <lb/>
            lawgiver does not conceive that those only are cities which are <lb/>
            built upon the earth, the materials of which are wood and <lb/>
            stone, but he thinks that there are other cities also which <lb/>
            men bear about with them, being built in their souls ; and <lb/>
            these are, as is natural, the archetypes and models of the <lb/>
            others, inasmuch as they have received a more divine building, <lb/>
            and the others are but imitations of them, as consisting of <lb/>
            perishable substances.</p>
          <p>But there are two species of cities, the one better, the <lb/>
            other worse. That is the better which enjoys a democratic <lb/>
            government, a constitution which honours equality, the rulers <lb/>
            of which are law and justice; and such a constitution as this <lb/>
            is a hymn to God. But that is the worse kind which adulte <lb/>
            rates this constitution, just as base and clipped money is <lb/>
            adulterated in the coinage, being, in fact, ochlocracy, which <lb/>
            admires inequality, in which injustice and lawlessness bear <lb/>
            sway. Now good men are enrolled as citizens in the consti­ <lb/>
            tution of the first-mentioned kind of city; but the multitude <lb/>
            of the wicked clings to the other and worse sort, loving dis­ <lb/>
            order more than orderliness, and confusion rather than well­ <lb/>
            established steadiness.</p>
          <p>And the wicked man seeks for coadjutors in his practice of <lb/>
            wickedness, not looking upon himself as sufficient by himself. <lb/>
            And he exhorts the sight, and he exhorts the hearing, and he <lb/>
            exhorts every outward sense in succession, to range itself on <lb/>
            his side without delay, and every one of th em to bring to him <note type="footnote"> it Exodus ii. 6. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="24"/>
            all things necessary for his service. And he raises up and <lb/>
            sharpens all the rest of the company of the passions, which are <lb/>
            by their own nature unmanageable, in order that by the ad­ <lb/>
            dition of practice and care they may become irresistible. The <lb/>
            mind, therefore, having called in these allies, says, " Let us <lb/>
            build ourselves a city an expression equivalent to, Let us <lb/>
            fortify our own things ; let us fence them around to the best <lb/>
            of our power, so that we may not be easily taken by those <lb/>
            who attack us; let us divide and distribute, as into tribes and <lb/>
            boroughs, each of the powers existing in the soul, allotting <lb/>
            some to the rational part, and some to the irrational part; <lb/>
            let us choose competent rulers, wealth, glory, honour, pleasure. <lb/>
            by means of which we may be able to become masters of every­ <lb/>
            thing ; banishing to a distance justice, the invariable cause <lb/>
            of poverty and ingloriousness ; and let us enact laws, which <lb/>
            shall confirm the chief power and advantage to those who are <lb/>
            always able to get the better of others.</p>
          <p>And let a tower be built in this city as a citadel, to be a <lb/>
            strong palace for the tyrant vice, whose feet shall walk upon <lb/>
            the earth, and its head shall, through pride, be raised to such <lb/>
            a height as to reach even to heaven ; for, in good truth, it <lb/>
            rests not only upon human sins, but it also hastens forward <lb/>
            as far as heaven, pushing up its words of impiety and ungod­ <lb/>
            liness, since it either speaks of God so as to assert that he has <lb/>
            no existence, or that, though he exists, he has no providence, <lb/>
            or to affirm that the world had no beginning of creation, or <lb/>
            that, admitting that it has been created, it is borne on by <lb/>
            unsteady causes, just as chance may direct, at one time wrongly, <lb/>
            at another time in an irreproachable manner, just as often <lb/>
            happens in the case of chariots or ships. For sometimes the <lb/>
            voyage of a ship, or the course of a chariot, goes on properly <lb/>
            even without charioteers or pilots; but success is not only now <lb/>
            and then owing to providences, but very often to human pru­ <lb/>
            dence and invariably to divine, since error is admitted to be <lb/>
            altogether incompatible with divine power. Now what object <lb/>
            can the- foolish men have who, speaking figuratively, build up <lb/>
            the reasonings of wickedness like a tower, except the desire of <lb/>
            leaving behind them a name which shall be far from a good name?</p>
          <p>XXIV. For they say, " Let us make for ourselves a name." <lb/>
            0, the excessive and profligate impudence of such a <lb/>
            saying! What say ye ? When ye ought to seek to bury <lb/>
             <pb n="25"/>
            your iniquities under night and profound darkness, and to <lb/>
            assume as a veil for them, shame, if not genuine, at all events <lb/>
            pretended shame, whether for the sake of gaining favour in the <lb/>
            eyes of the moderate and virtuous, or for that of avoiding <lb/>
            punishment for admitted wickedness; do ye, nevertheless, <lb/>
            proceed to such a pitch of audacity, as all but to come forth and <lb/>
            display yourselves in the light and in the most brilliant beams <lb/>
            of the sun, and to fear neither the threats of better men, nor <lb/>
            the implacable justice of God, which impends over such un­ <lb/>
            godly and desperate men ? But ye think fit even to send <lb/>
            around in every direction reports, to carry intelligence of your <lb/>
            domestic iniquities, in order that no one may be uninformed of <lb/>
            or unacquainted with your deeds of daring wickedness, wretched <lb/>
            and infamous men that ye are.</p>
          <p>What name, therefore, do ye wish to assume ? Is it the one <lb/>
            which is most suitable to your actions ? But is there not one <lb/>
            name only which is suited to them ? It may, perhaps, be one <lb/>
            in genus; but there are ten thousand such names in species, <lb/>
            which you will hear from others, even if ye keep silence your­ <lb/>
            selves. The names adapted to your conduct are, rashness <lb/>
            united with shamelessness, insolence combined with violence, <lb/>
            violence in union with homicide, corruption in combination <lb/>
            with adultery, undefined appetite accompanied by unmeasured <lb/>
            indulgence in pleasures, folly joined with impudence, injustice <lb/>
            united to crafty wickedness, theft combined with rapine, per­ <lb/>
            jury united with lying, impiety combined with utter lawless­ <lb/>
            ness. Such, and similar to these, are the names of such <lb/>
            actions. And it is well for them to boast over and pride <lb/>
            themselves, upon seeking for reputation from actions which it <lb/>
            would be more seemly to hide and to be ashamed of.</p>
          <p>And, indeed, some persons do pride themselves on these <lb/>
            things, thinking that in consequence of them they do derive a <lb/>
            certain irresistible degree of power among men from this idea <lb/>
            being entertained respecting them ; but they will not escape the <lb/>
            divine vengeance for their enormous audacity, and very soon <lb/>
            they will have occasion not only to anticipate at a distance, but <lb/>
            even to see immediately impending their own death. For they <lb/>
            say, “ Before we are dispersed, let us have a care for our <lb/>
            name and our glory." Should I not then say to them, Ye know <lb/>
            that ye will be dispersed ? Why, then, do ye commit iniquity ?</p>
          <p>But perhaps he is here placing before us the manner of <lb/>
             <pb n="26"/>
            foolish men who, even when the very greatest punishments are <lb/>
            not obscurely impending over them, but are often visibly <lb/>
            threatening them, nevertheless do not hesitate to commit <lb/>
            iniquity. And the punishments, however they may seem to be <lb/>
            concealed, are in reality most notorious, which are inflicted by <lb/>
            God. For all the most wicked of men adopt ideas that they <lb/>
            can never escape the knowledge of the deity when doing <lb/>
            wrong, and that they shall never be able to ward off alto­ <lb/>
            gether the day of retribution. Since otherwise, how do they <lb/>
            know that they will be dispersed ? And yet they say, " Before <lb/>
            we are dispersed." But their conscience, which is within, con­ <lb/>
            victs them, and pricks them vehemently, when devoting them­ <lb/>
            selves to ungodliness, so as to draw them against their will to <lb/>
            a confession that all the circumstances affecting men are over­ <lb/>
            looked by a superior nature, and that justice is watching above, <lb/>
            as an incorruptible chastiser, hating the unjust actions of the <lb/>
            impious, and the reasonings and speeches which undertake <lb/>
            their defence.</p>
          <p>XXV. But all these men are the offspring of that wicked­ <lb/>
            ness which is always dying but which never dies, the name of <lb/>
            which is Cain. Is not Cain represented as having begotten a <lb/>
            son whom he called Enoch,* and as building a city to which he <lb/>
            gave the same name, and as after a fashion building up created <lb/>
            and mortal things to the destruction of those things which <lb/>
            have received a more divine formation ? For the name Enoch, <lb/>
            being interpreted, means "thy grace." But every impious man <lb/>
            supposes that what he thinks and understands is owing to the <lb/>
            bounty of his intellect towards him; that what he sees is the <lb/>
            gift of his eyes to him, what he hears of his ears, what he <lb/>
            smells of his nostrils, and so that each of his outward senses <lb/>
            bestows on him those perceptions which are in accordance with <lb/>
            them. Again, that it is the organs of the voice which endow <lb/>
            him with the capacity of speaking, and that there is actually <lb/>
            no such thing as a God at all, or at all events that he is not <lb/>
            the primary cause of things.</p>
          <p>Because of these views he assigns to himself the first fruits <lb/>
            of the fruits which he extracts from the earth by his husbandry, <lb/>
            being contented afterwards to offer to God some of the fruit, <lb/>
            and that too though he has a sound example at hand ; for <lb/>
            his brother offers a sacrifice of the offspring of the flock, offer­ <note type="footnote"> * Genesis iv. 17. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="27"/>
            ing the firstborn, and not those which are of secondary value ; <lb/>
            confessing that the eldest causes of all existing things are <lb/>
            suited to the eldest and first cause. But the impious man <lb/>
            thinks exactly the contrary, namely, that the mind is endowed <lb/>
            with absolute power to do whatever it desires, and that the <lb/>
            outward senses have absolute power as to all that they feel, <lb/>
            for that both the mind and the outward senses decide in an <lb/>
            irreproachable and unerring manner, the one on bodies, and <lb/>
            the other on everything. Now what can be more open to <lb/>
            blame, or more capable of conviction by truth, than such ideas <lb/>
            as these ? Has not the mind been repeatedly convicted of <lb/>
            innumerable acts of folly ? And have not all the outward <lb/>
            senses been convicted of bearing false witness, and that too <lb/>
            not by irrational judges who, it is natural to suppose, may be <lb/>
            deceived, but before the tribunal of nature herself, which it is <lb/>
            impossible to corrupt or to pervert ?</p>
          <p>And indeed as the criteria both of our mind and of our <lb/>
            outward senses are liable to error respecting even ourselves, <lb/>
            it follows of necessity that we must make the corresponding <lb/>
            confession that God sheds upon the mind the power of intel­ <lb/>
            lect, and on the outward senses the faculty of apprehension, <lb/>
            and that these benefits are conferred upon us not by our <lb/>
            own members but by him to whom also we owe our existence.</p>
          <p>XXVI. The children who have received from their father <lb/>
            the inheritance of self-love are eager to go on increasing up to <lb/>
            heaven, until justice, which loves virtue and hates iniquity, <lb/>
            coming destroys their cities which they have built up by the <lb/>
            side of their miserable souls, and the tower the name of which <lb/>
            is displayed in the book which is entitled the Book of Judg­ <lb/>
            ment. And the name is, as the Hebrews say, Phanuel, which <lb/>
            translated into our language means, “ turning away from <lb/>
            God." For any strong building which is erected by means of <lb/>
            plausible arguments is not built for the sake of any other <lb/>
            object except that of averting and alienating the mind from <lb/>
            the honour due to God, than which object what can be more <lb/>
            iniquitous? But for the destruction of this strong fortifica­ <lb/>
            tion a ravager and an enemy of iniquity is prepared who is <lb/>
            always full of hostility towards it; whom the Hebrews call <lb/>
            Gideon; which name being interpreted means, " a retreat for <lb/>
            robbers." "For," says Moses, " Gideon swore to the men of <lb/>
            Phanuel, saying, On the day when I return victorious in peace, <lb/>
             <pb n="28"/>
            I will overthrow this tower." * A very beautiful and most <lb/>
            becoming boast for the soul which hates wickedness and is <lb/>
            sharpened against the impious, namely, that it is resolved to <lb/>
            overthrow every reasoning which by its persuasions seeks to <lb/>
            turn the mind away from holiness, and this indeed is the <lb/>
            natural result. For when the mind turns round, then that <lb/>
            which turns away from it, and rejects it is again dissolved, <lb/>
            and this is the opportunity for destroying it which (a most <lb/>
            wonderful thing) he calls not war but peace. For, owing to <lb/>
            the stability and firmness of the mind which piety is accus­ <lb/>
            tomed to produce, every reasoning which impiety has formed <lb/>
            is overturned.</p>
          <p>Many also have even erected the outward senses after the <lb/>
            fashion of a tower, raising them to such a height as to be able <lb/>
            to reach the very borders of heaven. But the term heaven <lb/>
            is here used symbolically to signify our mind, according to which <lb/>
            the best and most divine natures revolve. But they who dare <lb/>
            such deeds prefer the outward senses to the intellect, and <lb/>
            desire by means of the outward senses forcibly to destroy all <lb/>
            the objects of intellect, compelling those things which are, at <lb/>
            present masters to descend into the rank of servants, and rais­ <lb/>
            ing those things which are by nature slaves to the rank of <lb/>
            masters.</p>
          <p>XXVII. And the statement, " The Lord went down to see <lb/>
            that city and that tower " must be listened to altogether as if <lb/>
            spoken in a figurative sense. For to think that the divinity <lb/>
            can go towards, or go from, or go down, or go to meet, or, in <lb/>
            short, that it has the same positions and motions as particular <lb/>
            animals, and that it is susceptible of real motion at all, is, to <lb/>
            use a common proverb, an impiety deserving of being <lb/>
            banished beyond the sea and beyond the world. But these <lb/>
            things are spoken, as if of man, by the lawgiver, of God who <lb/>
            is not invested with human form, for the sake of advantage to <lb/>
            us who are to be instructed, as I have often said before with <lb/>
            reference to other passages. Since who is there who does not <lb/>
            know that it is indispensable for a person who goes down, to <lb/>
            leave one place and to occupy another ? But all places are <lb/>
            filled at once by God, who surrounds them all and is not <lb/>
            surrounded by any of them, to whom alone it is possible to be <lb/>
            everywhere and also nowhere. Nowhere, because he himself <note type="footnote"> * Judges viii. 9. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="29"/>
            created place and space at the same time that he created <lb/>
            bodies, and it is impious to say that the Creator is contained in <lb/>
            anything that he has created.</p>
          <p>Again, he is everywhere, because, having extended his powers <lb/>
            so as to make them pervade earth, and water, and air, and <lb/>
            heaven, he has left no portion of the world desolate, but, hav­ <lb/>
            ing collected everything together, he has bound them with <lb/>
            chains which cannot be burst,* so that they are never eman­ <lb/>
            cipated, on which account he is especially to be praised with <lb/>
            hymns.</p>
          <p>For that which is higher than all powers is understood to <lb/>
            exceed them, not merely in the fact of its existence. But the <lb/>
            power of this being which made and arranged everything is <lb/>
            with perfect truth called God, and it contains everything in its <lb/>
            bosom, and pervades every portion of the universe. But the <lb/>
            divine being, both invisible and incomprehensible, is indeed <lb/>
            everywhere, but still, in truth, he is nowhere visible or com­ <lb/>
            prehensible. But when he says, " I am he who stands before <lb/>
            thee, ”† he appears indeed to be displayed and to be compre­ <lb/>
            hended, though before any exhibition or conception he was <lb/>
            superior to all created things. Therefore, no one of the words <lb/>
            which implies a motion from place to place is appropriate to <lb/>
            that God who exists only in essence ; such expressions, I mean, <lb/>
            as going upwards or downwards, to the right or to the left, <lb/>
            forwards or backwards. For he is not conceived of in any <lb/>
            one of the above mentioned ideas, inasmuch as he never <lb/>
            turns round or changes his place.</p>
          <p>But, nevertheless, he is said to have come down and to have <lb/>
            seen, he who by his foreknowledge comprehends everything, <lb/>
            not only that has happened, but even before it happens; and <lb/>
            this expression is used for the sake of exhortation and instruc­ <lb/>
            'tion, in order that no man, indulging in uncertain conjectures <lb/>
            about matters which he is not present to behold may, while <lb/>
            standing afar off, be too prompt to believe idle fancies, but that <lb/>
            every one may come close to the facts, and examining each <lb/>
            one separately, may carefully and thoroughly consider them. <lb/>
            For certain sight is more deserving to be looked upon as a <note type="footnote"> * The text has <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀοράτοις</foreign>, “ invisible," but I have followed Mangey'd <lb/>
            translation, who reads <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀῤῤήκτοις</foreign>. The remainder of the sentence is <lb/>
            exceedingly corrupt. </note><note type="footnote"> t Exodus xvii. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ε</foreign>. </note> <lb/>

            trustworthy witness than fallacious hearing. On which account <lb/>
            a law has been enacted among those nations which have the <lb/>
            most excellent constitution, that one must not give evidence <lb/>
            on hearsay, because by its own nature the tribunal of the sense <lb/>
            of hearing is liable to be corrupted. And Moses indeed says <lb/>
            in the prohibitory part of his law, “Thou shalt not receive vain <lb/>
            hearing.''* Meaning not only this, that one ought not to <lb/>
            receive false or silly reports by hearsay, but that, as far as the <lb/>
            clear comprehension of the truth is concerned, the hearing is <lb/>
            a long way behind the sight, being full of vanity.</p>
          <p>XXVIII. We say that this is the reason why it is said that <lb/>
            God went down to see the city and the tower ; and the addition, <lb/>
            " Which the sons of men had built," is not a mere superfluity. <lb/>
            For perhaps some profanely disposed person may mock and <lb/>
            say, " The lawgiver is here teaching us a very novel kind of <lb/>
            lesson, when he says that no one else but the sons of men <lb/>
            build cities and towers ; for who, even of the most crazy <lb/>
            people is ignorant of what is so evident and notorious as that ?” <lb/>
            But we must not suppose that such a plain and unquestionable <lb/>
            fact as that, is what is intended to be conveyed by the mention <lb/>
            of it in the holy scriptures, but rather there is some hidden <lb/>
            meaning concealed under these apparently plain words which <lb/>
            we must trace out. What then is this hidden meaning ?</p>
          <p>Those who, as it were, attribute many fathers to existing <lb/>
            things, and who represent the company of the gods as nume­ <lb/>
            rous, displaying great ignorance of the nature of things and <lb/>
            causing great confusion, and making pleasure the proper object <lb/>
            of the soul, are those who are, if we must tell the plain truth, <lb/>
            spoken of as the builders of the aforesaid city, and of the <lb/>
            citadel in it; having increased the efficient causes of the <lb/>
            desired end, building them up like houses, being, as I imagine, <lb/>
            in no respect different from the children of the harlot whom <lb/>
            the law expels from the assembly of God, where it says, " The <lb/>
            offspring of a harlot shall not come into the assembly of the <lb/>
            Lord." t</p>
          <p>Because, like archers shooting at random at many objects, <lb/>
            and not aiming skilfully or successfully at any one mark, so <lb/>
            these men, putting forward ten thousand principles and causes <lb/>
            for the creation of the universe, every one of which is false, <lb/>
            display a perfect ignorance of the one Creator and Father of <note type="footnote"> * Exodus xxiii. 1. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Deuteronomy xxiii. 2. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="31"/>
            all things; but they who have real knowledge, are properly <lb/>
            addressed as the sons of the one God, as Moses also entitles <lb/>
            them, where he says, “ Ye are the sons of the Lord God." * <lb/>
            And again, " God who begot thee; ” † and in another place, <lb/>
            " Is not he thy father?"</p>
          <p>Accordingly, it is natural for those who have this disposition <lb/>
            of soul to look upon nothing as beautiful except what is good, <lb/>
            which is the citadel erected by those who are experienced in <lb/>
            this kind of warfare as a defence against the end of pleasure, <lb/>
            and as a means of defeating and destroying it. And even if <lb/>
            there be not as yet any one who is worthy to be called a son of <lb/>
            God, nevertheless let him labour earnestly to be adorned ac­ <lb/>
            cording to his first-born word, the eldest of his angels, as the <lb/>
            great archangel of many names ; for he is called, the authority, <lb/>
            and the name of God, and the Word, and man according to <lb/>
            God's image, and he who sees Israel. For which reason I was <lb/>
            induced a little while ago to praise the principles of those who <lb/>
            said, "We are all one man's sons." ‡ For even if we are not <lb/>
            yet suitable to be called the sons of God, still we may deserve <lb/>
            to be called the children of his eternal image, of his most <lb/>
            sacred word; for the image of God is his most ancient <lb/>
            word.</p>
          <p>And, indeed, in many passages of the law, the children of <lb/>
            Israel are called hearers of him that seeth, since hearing is <lb/>
            honoured with the second rank next after the sense of sight, <lb/>
            and since that which is in need of instruction is at all times <lb/>
            second to that which can receive clear impressions of the sub­ <lb/>
            jects submitted to it without any such information. And I <lb/>
            also admire the things which are spoken under divine inspira­ <lb/>
            tion in the books of Kings, according to which those who <lb/>
            flourished many generations afterwards and lived in a blame­ <lb/>
            less manner, are spoken of as the sons of David who wrote <lb/>
            hymns to God; § though, during his lifetime, even their great <lb/>
            grandfathers had not yet been born. The truth is, that the <lb/>
            birth here spoken of is that of souls made immortal by their <lb/>
            virtues, not of perishable bodies, and this birth is naturally <lb/>
            referred to the leaders of virtue, as its parents and progeni­ <lb/>
            tors.</p>
          <p>XXIX. But against those who pride themselves on injustice. <note type="footnote"> Deuteronomy xiv. 1. </note><note type="footnote"> ‡ Genesis xlii. 11. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Deuteronomy xxxii. 18. </note><note type="footnote"> § 2 Ezr. viii. 2. </note> <lb/>

            the Lord said, "Behold, there is one race and one language <lb/>
            among them all," an expression equivalent to, Behold, there <lb/>
            is one family and one bond of relationship, and also, one <lb/>
            harmony and agreement among them all together, no one being <lb/>
            in his mind at all alienated from or disconnected with his <lb/>
            neighbour, as is the case with illiterate men. For at times, <lb/>
            the organ of speech among them is, in all its tones, out of tune <lb/>
            and inharmonious in no slight degree, being in fact carefully <lb/>
            arranged so as to produce inharmoniousness, and having only <lb/>
            such a concert as will cause a want of melody.</p>
          <p>And in the case of fevers,* one may see very similar effects ; <lb/>
            for they are periodical changes, in some recurring every day, <lb/>
            in others every third or every fourth day, as the sons of the <lb/>
            physicians say; and they have also stated hours, both by day <lb/>
            and night, at which important crises may be expected, and <lb/>
            they at all times keep nearly the same order.</p>
          <p>And the expression, " And they began to do this," is said <lb/>
            with no moderate indignation, because it has not been suffi­ <lb/>
            cient for wicked men to confuse all the principles of justice <lb/>
            which affect those of the same country as themselves, but they <lb/>
            have ventured to transgress even the laws of Heaven, sowing <lb/>
            injustice and reaping impiety. But these wretched men <lb/>
            derive no advantage, for though those who seek to inflict <lb/>
            mutual injuries on one another, succeed in many of the objects <lb/>
            which they have at heart, bringing to their accomplishment in <lb/>
            action what they have decided on in their unwise minds, yet <lb/>
            . the case is not the same with the impious. For all things <lb/>
            belonging to the Deity are incapable of receiving either <lb/>
            damage or injury, and the unclean can only find out the be­ <lb/>
            ginnings of sinning in respect of them, but can never arrive <lb/>
            at the end which they propose to themselves ; on which ac­ <lb/>
            count this expression also occurs, " They began to do."</p>
          <p>Men full of an insatiable desire of doing wrong, not being <lb/>
            content with the crimes which they can perpetrate on earth, <lb/>
            by sea, and in the air, inasmuch as they are of a perishable <lb/>
            nature, have determined to array themselves against the divine <lb/>
            natures existing in heaven; which, as they are not reckoned <note type="footnote"> * I have translated Mangey's Latin translation. He pronounces the <lb/>

            among existing creatures are also out of all reach of injury.. <lb/>
            Even calumny itself can inflict no injury on those things if it <lb/>
            ventures to speak ill of them, inasmuch as they are never <lb/>
            moved from their everlasting and eternal natures, but it inflicts <lb/>
            incurable calamity on those who accuse it.</p>
          <p>Are they not to be blamed, since indeed they have only <lb/>
            begun, being unable to arrive at the end of the impiety they <lb/>
            propose to themselves, are they not, I say, to be blamed just as <lb/>
            much as if they had accomplished all the objects that they had <lb/>
            in view? On this account also, Moses speaks of them as having <lb/>
            finished the tower, though in fact they had not yet completed <lb/>
            it, where he says, " The Lord went down to see the city and <lb/>
            the tower," not which the sons of men were going to build, but <lb/>
            which they had built.</p>
          <p>XXX. What, then, is the proof that they had not entirely <lb/>
            completed this building ? First of all, the manifest notoriety <lb/>
            of the fact. For it is impossible for even so slight a portion of <lb/>
            the earth to touch the heaven, by reason of the cause before­ <lb/>
            mentioned, that no centre can ever touch the circumference; <lb/>
            in the second place, because the æther (<foreign xml:lang="grc">αἰθὴς</foreign>) is sacred fire and <lb/>
            an unquenchable flame, as its very name shows, being derived <lb/>
            from <foreign xml:lang="grc">αἴθω</foreign>, to burn, which is a synonymous word with <foreign xml:lang="grc">ϰαίω</foreign>. <lb/>
            And we have a witness in our favour in one portion of the <lb/>
            heavenly system of fire, that is in the sun, who, though he is <lb/>
            at such a distance from the earth, sends his beams down into <lb/>
            his inmost recesses, and sometimes warms and at times even <lb/>
            scorches the earth itself, and the air which reaches from the <lb/>
            earth up to the heavenly sphere, though it is by nature cold; <lb/>
            for all those things which are removed to a distance from his <lb/>
            rapid course, or which are in an oblique direction, one side of <lb/>
            it only warms; but those which are near to him, or in a direct <lb/>
            line from him, is violently burnt up.</p>
          <p>If, then, these things are so, was it not necessary that those <lb/>
            men who were endeavouring to mount up to heaven must have <lb/>
            been stricken with thunderbolts and burnt up, their high­ <lb/>
            minded and proud designs being unaccomplished by them? <lb/>
            This is the meaning which Moses appears to intend to convey, <lb/>
            figuratively, by the expressions which follow: " For they <note type="footnote"> * This passage again in the text is unintelligible, and pronounced by <lb/>
            Mangey to be in a state of hopeless corruption. </note> <note type="footnote"> VOL. II. </note> <note type="footnote"> D </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="34"/>
            ceased," says he, "to build the city and the tower.”* Not, <lb/>
            indeed, because they had finished their work, but because they <lb/>
            were prevented from accomplishing it by the confusion which <lb/>
            supervened. Nevertheless, they have not escaped blame for <lb/>
            their actions, inasmuch as they had decided on them and <lb/>
            attempted to carry them out.</p>
          <p>XXXI. At all events, the law says that that soothsayer and <lb/>
            diviner who was led into folly in respect of his unstable conjec­ <lb/>
            tures (for the name, Balaam, being interpreted, means un­ <lb/>
            stable), “ cursed the people that saw ;"f and that, too, though <lb/>
            as far as his words go he uttered only words of good omen and <lb/>
            prayers. The law here looking not at the words he uttered, <lb/>
            which, through the providence of God, did change their <lb/>
            character, becoming good money instead of base coinage, but <lb/>
            having regard to the intention in which injurious things were <lb/>
            resolved in preference to beneficial ones. But these things are, <lb/>
            by nature inimical to one another, conjectures being at variance <lb/>
            with truth, and vain opinion with knowledge, and prophecy, <lb/>
            which is not dictated by divine inspiration, being directly <lb/>
            opposed to sober wisdom.</p>
          <p>And even if any one, rising up as it were from his ambush, <lb/>
            were to try, but to be unable, to slay a man, stilt he is none the <lb/>
            less liable to the punishment due to homicides, as the law <lb/>
            which is enacted about such persons shows. " For if," says <lb/>
            the law. " any one attacks his neighbour, wishing to slay him <lb/>
            by treachery, and escapes, thou shalt apprehend him, even at <lb/>
            the altar, to put him to death.”‡ And yet the thing con­ <lb/>
            demned is the attacking with intent to kill, not the actual <lb/>
            killing, but the law looks upon the intention to slay as equal <lb/>
            in guilt to the actual slaying; on which account it does not <lb/>
            grant pardon to such a man even if he supplicates for it, but <lb/>
            bids one drag the man who has cherished so unholy a design <lb/>
            even from the temple itself.</p>
          <p>And such a man is unholy, not merely because he has <lb/>
            plotted slaughter against a soul which might have lived for <lb/>
            ever through its acquisition and use of virtue, making an <lb/>
            attack on it through the agency of wicked ness, but also because <lb/>
            he blames God as the cause of his ungodly audacity ; for the <lb/>
            word, “ escapes," has such a meaning as this concealed under <lb/>
            it. Because many men wish to escape from accusations which <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xi. 8. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Deut. xxiii. 4. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Exodus xxi. 14. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="35"/>
            are brought against themselves, and think it fitting that they <lb/>
            should be delivered from the punishments due to the offences <lb/>
            which they have committed, and so they attribute their own <lb/>
            iniquity to him who is the cause of no evil, but of all kinds of <lb/>
            good, namely, to God; for which reason it was accounted as no <lb/>
            violation of divine law to drag such men even from the altars <lb/>
            themselves.</p>
          <p>And it was an excessive punishment which was then de­ <lb/>
            nounced against the reasons which were thus built up and put <lb/>
            together for purposes of impiety ; which, however, perhaps <lb/>
            some foolish persons will look upon not as injury, but as a <lb/>
            benefit. “ For," says Moses, " there shalt not fail to them any <lb/>
            one of the things which they have endeavoured to do."* Alas <lb/>
            for their unlimited and interminable misery! All the objects <lb/>
            which the most insane intention fixes its desires upon shall be <lb/>
            successfully carried out, and shall obey its will, so that nothing <lb/>
            whatever shall fail, either small or great, but everything shall, <lb/>
            as it were, make haste to meet and to anticipate their require­ <lb/>
            ments.</p>
          <p>XXXII These things are an exhibition of a soul destitute <lb/>
            of prudence, and which meets with no impediment to its in­ <lb/>
            dulging in sin; for whoever is not utterly incurable would <lb/>
            rather pray that all the purposes of his mind might fail, so <lb/>
            that if he had formed a resolution to steal, or to commit adul­ <lb/>
            tery, or to murder a man, or to commit sacrilege, or to perpe­ <lb/>
            trate any similar crime, he might not succeed, but might find <lb/>
            innumerable obstacles. For such hindrance would get rid of <lb/>
            the greatest of all diseases, injustice ; but any one who is free <lb/>
            from all fear is sure to admit this malady.</p>
          <p>Why then, my friends, do you any longer praise or admire <lb/>
            the fortunes of tyrants, owing to which they succeed with ease <lb/>
            in everything which they undertake, and which a frenzied and <lb/>
            unrestrained mind prompts them to do? And yet one ought <lb/>
            rather to lament over them, since inability and powerlessness <lb/>
            to succeed in their objects is advantageous to the wicked, just <lb/>
            as abundant opportunity and power is the most beneficial thing <lb/>
            for the good. But one of the crowd of foolish men, perceiving <lb/>
            to what an abundant superfluity of misery indulgence in sinning <lb/>
            leads, said, speaking with perfect freedom, " My wickedness is <lb/>
            too great for me to be forgiven.”† <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xi. 6. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Genesis iv. 13. </note> <note type="footnote"> D 2 </note> <pb n="36"/>
            </p>
          <p>It is, therefore, very melancholy indeed for the soul, which <lb/>
            is by its own nature unmanageable, to be left without any re­ <lb/>
            straint ; while it is scarcely possible for any one to hold it in <lb/>
            with reins, and by that means, in conjunction with the infliction <lb/>
            of stripes, to reduce it to reason. On which account an oracle of <lb/>
            the all-merciful God has been given, full of gentleness, which <lb/>
            shadows forth good hopes to those who love instruction, in <lb/>
            these terms : " I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee."* <lb/>
            For when the chains of the soul, by which it has been used to <lb/>
            be held in bondage, are loosened, then the greatest of all <lb/>
            calamities follows, namely, the being deserted by God, who <lb/>
            has fastened chains which can never be broken round the <lb/>
            universe, namely, his own powers, with which he binds every­ <lb/>
            thing, willing that it shall never more be released. Accord­ <lb/>
            ingly, he says, in another passage, that " all things which are <lb/>
            bound with a chain are pure ;"t since unbinding is the cause of <lb/>
            the destruction of that which is impure.</p>
          <p>Beware, then, lest when you see a man accomplishing with­ <lb/>
            out difficulty all the objects which he endeavours to effect, you <lb/>
            admire him as a prosperous man ; take care rather to pity him <lb/>
            as a very unfortunate one, because he passes his whole life in a <lb/>
            perfect destitution of virtue and a great abundance of vice.</p>
          <p>XXXIII. And it is worth while to consider in no superficial <lb/>
            manner what the meaning is of that expression which is put <lb/>
            by Moses into the mouth of God : " Come, let us go down and <lb/>
            confuse their language there.”† For here God is represented <lb/>
            as if he were speaking to some beings who were his coadjutors. <lb/>
            And the very same idea may be excited by what is said in the <lb/>
            account of the creation of the world, for there, too, Moses re­ <lb/>
            cords that " the Lord God said, Come, let us now make man <lb/>
            in our image; man in our similitude.”§ The expression, " Let <lb/>
            us make," implying a number of creators. And, in another <lb/>
            place, we are told that God said, " Behold, the man, Adam, has <lb/>
            become as one of us, in respect of his knowing good and evil ;”|| <lb/>
            for the expression, " as one of us," is not applicable to one <lb/>
            person, but to many.</p>
          <p>In the first place then, we must say this, that there is no <lb/>
            existing being equal in honour to God, but there is one only <note type="footnote"> * Joshua i. 5. </note><note type="footnote"> § Genesis i. 26. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Numbers xix. 15. </note><note type="footnote"> || Genesis iii. 22. </note> <note type="footnote"> ‡ Genesis xi. 7. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="37"/>
            ruler and governor and king, to whom alone it is granted to <lb/>
            govern and to arrange the universe. For the verse- <lb/>
            A multitude of kings is never good, <lb/>
            Let there one sovereign, one sole monarch be, <lb/>
            is not more justly said with respect to cities and men than <lb/>
            with respect to the world and to God ; for it is clear from the <lb/>
            necessity of things that there must be one creator, and one <lb/>
            father, and one master of the one universe.</p>
          <p>XXXIV. This point then being thus granted, it is necessary <lb/>
            to convert with it also what follows, so as to adapt it properly. <lb/>
            Let us then consider what this is : God, being one, has about <lb/>
            him an unspeakable number of powers, all of which are <lb/>
            defenders and preservers of every thing that is created ; and <lb/>
            among these powers those also which are conversant with <lb/>
            punishment are involved. But even punishment is not a disad­ <lb/>
            vantageous thing, inasmuch as it is both a hindrance to and a <lb/>
            correction of doing wrong.</p>
          <p>Again, it is by means of these powers that the incorporeal <lb/>
            world, perceptible by the intellect, has been put together, which <lb/>
            is the archetypal model of this invisible world, being com­ <lb/>
            pounded of invisible species, just as this world is of invisible <lb/>
            bodies. Some persons therefore, admiring exceedingly the <lb/>
            nature of both these worlds, have not only deified them in their <lb/>
            wholes, but have also deified the most beautiful parts of them, <lb/>
            such as the sun and the moon, and the entire heaven, which, <lb/>
            having no reverence for anything, they have called gods. But <lb/>
            Moses, perceiving their design, says, “ 0 Lord, Lord, King ot <lb/>
            the gods,”† in order to show the difference between the ruler <lb/>
            and those subject to him, " And there is also in the air a most <lb/>
            sacred company of incorporeal souls as an attendant upon tho <lb/>
            heavenly souls ; for the word of prophecy is accustomed to call <lb/>
            these souls angels.</p>
          <p>It happens therefore that the whole army of each of these <lb/>
            worlds, being marshalled in their suitable ranks, are servants <lb/>
            and ministers of the ruler who has marshalled them, whom <lb/>
            they follow as their leader, in obedience to the principles of law <lb/>
            and justice; for it is impossible to suppose that the divine <lb/>
            army can even be detected in desertion. But it is suitable to <lb/>
            the character of the king to associate with his own powers, <lb/>
            and to avail himself of them, with a view to their ministrations <note type="footnote"> * Iliad ii. 204. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Deuteronomy x. 17. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="38"/>
            in such matters as it is not fitting should be settled by God <lb/>
            alone, for the Father of the universe has no need of anything, <lb/>
            so as to require assistance from any other quarter if he wishes <lb/>
            to make any thing.</p>
          <p>But seeing at once what is becoming, both for himself and <lb/>
            for his works of creation, there are some things which he has <lb/>
            entrusted to his subordinate powers to fashion ; and yethe has not <lb/>
            at once given even to them completely independent knowledge <lb/>
            to enable it to accomplish their objects, in order that no one <lb/>
            of those things which come to be created may be found to be <lb/>
            erroneously made.</p>
          <p>XXXV. These things, then, it was necessary to give an idea <lb/>
            of beforehand ; butfor what reason this was necessary we must now <lb/>
            say. The nature of animals was originally divided Into the por­ <lb/>
            tion endowed with and into that devoid of reason, the two <lb/>
            being at variance with one another. Again the rational division <lb/>
            was subdivided into the perishable and imperishable species, <lb/>
            the perishable species being the race of mankind, and the <lb/>
            imperishable species being the company of incorporeal souls <lb/>
            which revolve about the air and heaven.</p>
          <p>But these have no participation in wickedness, having <lb/>
            received from the very beginning an inheritance without stain <lb/>
            and full of happiness ; and not being bound up in the region of <lb/>
            interminable calamities, that is to say, in the body. The divi­ <lb/>
            sions also of the irrational part are free from any participation in <lb/>
            wickedness, inasmuch as, having no endowment of intellect, <lb/>
            they are never convicted of those deliberate acts of wickedness <lb/>
            which proceed upon consideration.</p>
          <p>But man is almost the only one of all living things which, <lb/>
            having a thorough knowledge of good and evil, often chooses <lb/>
            that which is worst, and rejects those things which are worthy <lb/>
            of earnest pursuit, so that he is often most justly condemned <lb/>
            as being guilty of deliberate and studied crime.</p>
          <p>Very appropriately therefore has God attributed the creation <lb/>
            of this being, man, to his lieutenants, saying, “ Let us make man," <lb/>
            in order that the successes of the intellect may be attributed <lb/>
            to him alone, but the errors of the being thus created, to his <lb/>
            subordinate power: for it did not appear to be suitable to the <lb/>
            dignity of God, the ruler of the universe, to make the road to <lb/>
            wickedness in a rational soul by his own agency; for which <lb/>
            reason he has committed to those about him the creation of this <lb/>
             <pb n="39"/>
            portion of the universe ; for it was necessary that the voluntary <lb/>
            principle, as the counterpoise to the involuntary principle, <lb/>
            should be established and made known, with a view to the <lb/>
            completion and perfection of the universe.</p>
          <p>XXXVI. And this may be enough to say in this manner; <lb/>
            and it is right that this point also should be considered, <lb/>
            namely that God is the cause only of what is good but is <lb/>
            absolutely the cause of no evil whatever, since he himself is <lb/>
            the most ancient of all existing things. and the most perfect of <lb/>
            all goods ; and it is most natural and becoming that he should <lb/>
            do what is most akin to his own nature, that is to say, that the <lb/>
            best of all beings should be the cause of all the best things, <lb/>
            but that the punishments appointed for the wicked are inflicted <lb/>
            by the means of his subordinate ministers. And there is an <lb/>
            evidence in favour of this assertion of mine in this expression, <lb/>
            which was uttered by the man who was made perfect by <lb/>
            practice; .. The God who nourished me from my youth up, the <lb/>
            angel who defended me from all evils ;"* for by these words he <lb/>
            already confesses that those genuine good things which nourish <lb/>
            the souls which love virtue, are referred to God as their sole <lb/>
            cause; but the fate of the wicked is, on the other hand, referred <lb/>
            to the angels, and even they have not independent and absolute <lb/>
            power of inflicting punishment, that this salutary nature may <lb/>
            not afford an opportunity to any one of the things which tend <lb/>
            to destruction.</p>
          <p>For this reason God says, " Come, let us go down and <lb/>
            confuse;" for the wicked, deserving to meet with such punish­ <lb/>
            ment as this, that the merciful, and beneficent, and bounteous, <lb/>
            powers of God should become known to them chiefly by its <lb/>
            inflictions. Knowing therefore that these powers are beneficial <lb/>
            to the race of man, he has appointed the punishments to be <lb/>
            inflicted by other beings ; for it was expedient that he himself <lb/>
            should be looked upon as the cause of well-doing, but in such a <lb/>
            way that the fountains of his everlasting graces should be kept <lb/>
            unmingled with any evils, not merely with those that are really <lb/>
            evils, but even with those which are accounted such.</p>
          <p>XXXVII. We must now examine what this confusion is. <lb/>
            How then shall we enter on this examination? In this manner, <lb/>
            in my opinion. We have very often known those whom we had <lb/>
            knowledge of before, from certain similarities and a comparison <note type="footnote">* Genesis xlviii. 16. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="40"/>
            of circumstances which have some connection with them. <lb/>
            Therefore we also become acquainted with things in the same <lb/>
            manner, which it is not easy to form a conception of from their <lb/>
            own nature, from some similarity of other things connected <lb/>
            with them. What things then resemble confusion ? Mixture, <lb/>
            as the ancient report has it, and combination; but mixture <lb/>
            takes place in dry things, and conbination is looked upon as <lb/>
            belonging to wet substances. Mixture then is a placing side <lb/>
            by side of different bodies in no regular order, as if any one <lb/>
            were to make a heap, bringing barley, and wheat, and pease, <lb/>
            and all sorts of other seeds, all into one mass ; but conbination <lb/>
            is not a placing side by side, but rather a mutual penetration <lb/>
            of dissimilar parts entering into one another at all points, so <lb/>
            that the distinctive qualities are still able to be distinguished by <lb/>
            some artificial skill, as they say is the case with respect to wine <lb/>
            and water; for these substances coming together form a <lb/>
            combination, but that which is combined is not the less <lb/>
            capable of being resolved again into the distinctive qualities <lb/>
            from which it was originally formed.</p>
          <p>For with a sponge saturated with oil it is possible for the <lb/>
            water to be taken up and for the wine to be left behind, which <lb/>
            may perhaps be because the origin of sponge is derived from <lb/>
            water, and therefore it is natural that water being a kindred <lb/>
            substance is calculated by nature to be taken up by the sponge <lb/>
            out of the combination, but that that substance which is of a <lb/>
            different nature, namely the wine, is naturally left behind.</p>
          <p>But confusion is the destruction of all the original distinctive <lb/>
            qualities, owing to their component parts penetrating one an­ <lb/>
            other at every point, so as to generate one thing wholly differ­ <lb/>
            ent, as is the case in that composition of the physicians which <lb/>
            they call the tetrapharmacon. For that, I imagine, is made up <lb/>
            of wax. and fat, and pitch, and resin, all compounded together, <lb/>
            but when the medicine has once been compounded, then it is <lb/>
            impossible for it again to be resolved into the powers of which <lb/>
            it was originally composed, but every one of them is destroyed <lb/>
            separately, and the destruction of them all has produced one <lb/>
            other power of exceeding excellence. But when God threatens <lb/>
            impious reasonings with confusion, he is in fact not only corn <lb/>
            manding the whole species and power of each separate wicked­ <lb/>
            ness to be destroyed, but also that thing which has been made <lb/>
            up of all their joint contributions ; so that neither the parts by <lb/>
             <pb n="41"/>
            themselves, nor the union and harmony of the whole, can con­ <lb/>
            tribute any strength hereafter towards the destruction of the <lb/>
            better part ; on which account, he says, " Let us then confuse <lb/>
            their language, so that each of them may not understand the <lb/>
            voice of his neighbour;" which is equivalent to, let us make <lb/>
            each separate one of the parts of wickedness deaf and dumb, <lb/>
            so that it shall neither utter a voice of its own, nor be able to <lb/>
            sound in unison with any other part, so as to be a cause of <lb/>
            mischief.</p>
          <p>XXXVII. This, now, is our opinion upon and interpretation <lb/>
            of this passage. But they who follow only what is plain and <lb/>
            easy, think that what is here intended to be recorded, is the <lb/>
            origin of the languages of the Greeks and barbarians, whom, <lb/>
            without blaming them (for, perhaps, they also put a correct <lb/>
            interpretation on the transaction), I would exhort not to be <lb/>
            content with stopping at this point, but to proceed onward to <lb/>
            look at the passage in a figurative way, considering that the <lb/>
            mere words of the scriptures are, as it were, but shadows of <lb/>
            bodies, and that the meanings which are apparent to investi­ <lb/>
            gation beneath them, are the real things to be pondered upon. <lb/>
            Accordingly, this lawgiver usually gives a handle for this doc­ <lb/>
            trine to those who are not utterly blind in their intellect; as <lb/>
            in fact he does in his account of this very event, which we are <lb/>
            now discussing : for he has called what took place, confusion ; <lb/>
            and yet, if he had only intended to speak of the origin of lan­ <lb/>
            guages, he would have given a more felicitous name, and one of <lb/>
            better omen, calling it division instead of confusion : for things <lb/>
            that are divided, are not confused, but, on the contrary, are <lb/>
            distinguished from one another, and not only is the one name <lb/>
            contrary to the other, but the one fact is contrary to the other <lb/>
            fact.</p>
          <p>For confusion, as I have already said, is the destruction of <lb/>
            simple powers for the production of one concrete power ; but <lb/>
            division is the dissection of one thing into many parts, as is the <lb/>
            case when one distinguishes a genus into its subordinate species <lb/>
            so that, if the wise God had ordered his ministers to divide lan <lb/>
            guage, which was previously only one, into the divisions of <lb/>
            several dialects, he would have used more appropriate expres­ <lb/>
            sions, which should have given a more accurate idea of the <lb/>
            case : calling what he did, dissection, or distribution, or division, <lb/>
            or something of that kind, but not confusion a name which is <lb/>
            at variance with all of them.</p><pb n="42"/>
            
          <p>But his especial object here is to dissolve the company of <lb/>
            wickedness, to put an end to their confederacy, to destroy their <lb/>
            community of action, to put out of sight and extirpate all their <lb/>
            powers, to overthrow the might of their dominion, which they <lb/>
            had strengthened by fearful lawlessness. Do you not see that <lb/>
            he also who made the parts of the soul did not unite any one <lb/>
            part to another in such a way as to enable one to discharge the <lb/>
            duties of the other? But the eyes would never be able to hear, <lb/>
            nor the ears to see, nor the lips of the mouth to smell, nor <lb/>
            the uostrils to taste ; nor, again, could reason ever be exposed <lb/>
            to those influences which operate upon the outward senses, nor <lb/>
            again, would the outward senses be able to develop reason. <lb/>
            For the Creator knew that it was desirable that each of these <lb/>
            parts should not hear the voice of its neighbour, but that the <lb/>
            parts of the soul should each exert its own peculiar faculties <lb/>
            without confusion, for the advantage of living animals, and <lb/>
            should, with the same object, be deprived of any power of exert­ <lb/>
            ing themselves in common, and that all the powers of vice <lb/>
            should be brought to confusion and utter destruction, so that <lb/>
            they might neither in confederacy, nor separately, be injurious <lb/>
            to the better parts.</p>
          <p>On which account Moses tells us, " The Lord scattered them <lb/>
            from thence ;” which is equivalent to, he dispersed them. he <lb/>
            put them to flight, he banished them, he destroyed them ; for <lb/>
            to scatter is sometimes done with a view to the production, and <lb/>
            growth, and increase of other things ; but there is another kind <lb/>
            which has for its object overthrow and destruction: but God, <lb/>
            the planter of the world, wishes to sow in everyone excellence, <lb/>
            but to scatter and drive from the world accursed impiety; that <lb/>
            the disposition which hates virtue may at last desist from <lb/>
            building up a city of wickedness, and a tower of impiety; for <lb/>
            when these are put to the rout, then those who have long ago <lb/>
            been banished by the tyranny of folly, now, at one proclama­ <lb/>
            tion, find themselves able to return to their own country, God <lb/>
            having drawn up and confirmed the proclamation, as the scrip­ <lb/>
            tures show, in which it is expressly stated that, " Even though <lb/>
            thy dispersion be from one end of heaven to the other end <lb/>
            of heaven, he will bring thee together from thence."*</p>
          <p>So that it is proper that the harmony of the virtues should <lb/>
            be arranged and cherished by God, and that he should dissolve <note type="footnote">* Deuteronomy xxx. 4. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="43"/>
            and destroy wickedness; and confusion is a name most appro­ <lb/>
            priate to wickedness, of which every foolish man is a visible <lb/>
            proof, having all his words, and intentions, and actions, inca­ <lb/>
            pable of standing an examination and destitute of steadiness.</p>

          </head>
          <p>I. AND the Lord said to Abraham, " Depart from thy land, <lb/>
            and from thy kindred, and from thy father's house, to a land <lb/>
            which I will show thee; and I will make thee into a great <lb/>
            nation. And I will bless thee, and I will magnify thy name, <lb/>
            and thou shalt be blessed. And I will bless them that bless <lb/>
            thee, and I will curse them that curse thee; and in thy name <lb/>
            shall all the nations of the earth be blessed."*</p>
          <p>God, wishing to purify the soul of man, first of all gives it <lb/>
            an impulse towards complete salvation, namely, a change of <lb/>
            abode, so as to quit the three regions of the body, the outward <lb/>
            sense and speech according to utterance ; for his country is the <lb/>
            emblem of the body, and his kindred are the symbol of the <lb/>
            outward sense, and his father's house of speech. Why so ? <lb/>
            Because the body derives its composition from the earth, and is <lb/>
            again dissolved into earth ; and Moses is a witness of this when <lb/>
            he says, " Dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return."t <lb/>
            For he says, that man was compounded by God fashioning a <lb/>
            lump of clay into the form of a man ; and it follows of necessity <lb/>
            that, a composite being, when dissolved, must be dissolved into <lb/>
            its component parts. But the outward sense is nearly con­ <lb/>
            nected with and akin to the mind, the irrational part to the <lb/>
            rational, since they are both parts of one soul: but speech is the <lb/>
            abode of the father, because our father is the mind, which im­ <lb/>
            plants in each of its parts its own powers, and distributes its <lb/>
            energies among them, undertaking the care and superinten <lb/>
            dence of them all; and the abode in which it dwells is speech, <lb/>
            a dwelling separated from all the rest of the house ; for as the <lb/>
            hearth is the abode of a man, so is speech of the mind : at all <note type="footnote"> * Gent ei3 XII. 1. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Genesis iii. 19. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="44"/>
            events, it displays itself, and all the notions which it con­ <lb/>
            ceives, arranging them and setting them in order in speech, <lb/>
            as if in a house.</p>
          <p>And you must not wonder that Moses has called speech in <lb/>
            man the abode of the mind, for he also says, that the mind 01 <lb/>
            the universe, that is to say, God, has for his abode his own <lb/>
            word. And the practiser of virtue, Jacob, seizing on this <lb/>
            apprehension, confesses in express words that, ,. This is no other <lb/>
            than the house of God,"* an expression equivalent to, The house <lb/>
            of God is not this thing, or anything which can be made the <lb/>
            subject of ocular demonstration, or, in short, anything which <lb/>
            comes under the province of the outward senses, but is invisible, <lb/>
            destitute of all specific form, only to be comprehended by the <lb/>
            soul as soul. What, then, can it be except the Word, which <lb/>
            is more ancient than all the things which were the objects of <lb/>
            creation, and by means of which it is that the Ruler of the <lb/>
            universe, taking hold of it as a rudder, governs all things. And <lb/>
            when he was fashioning the world, he used this as his instru- <lb/>
            merit for the blameless arrangement of all the things which <lb/>
            he was completing.</p>
          <p>II. That lie means by Abraham's country the body, <lb/>
            and by his kindred the outward senses, and by his father's <lb/>
            house uttered speech, we have now shown. But the command, <lb/>
            " Depart from them, " is not like or equivalent to, Be separated <lb/>
            from them according to your essence, since that would be the <lb/>
            injunction of one who was pronouncing sentence of death. <lb/>
            But it is the same as saying, Be alienated from them in your <lb/>
            mind, allowing none of them to cling to you, standing above <lb/>
            them all ; they are your subjects, use them not as your rulers; <lb/>
            since you are a king, learn to govern and not to be governed <lb/>
            know yourself all your life, as Moses teaches us in many <lb/>
            passages where he says, "Take heed to thyself. "† For thus <lb/>
            you will perceive what you ought to be obedient to, and what <lb/>
            you ought to be the master of. Depart therefore from the <lb/>
            earthly parts which envelop you, 0 my friend, fleeing from that <lb/>
            base and polluted prison house the body, and from the keepers <lb/>
            as it were of the prison, its pleasures and appetites, putting <lb/>
            forth all your strength and all your power so as to suffer none <lb/>
            of thy good things to come to harm, but improving all your <lb/>
            good faculties together and unitedly. Depart also from thy <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xxviii. 17. </note> <note type="footnote"> † Exodus xxxiv. 1 2. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="45"/>
            kindred, outward senses; for now indeed you have given your­ <lb/>
            self up to each of them to be made use of as it will, and you <lb/>
            have become a good, the property of others who have borrowed <lb/>
            you, having lost your own power over yourself. But you know <lb/>
            that, even though all men are silent on the subject, your <lb/>
            eyes lead you, and so do your ears, and all the rest of the <lb/>
            multitude of that kindred connection, towards those objects <lb/>
            which are pleasing to themselves. But if you choose to collect <lb/>
            again those portions of yourself which you have lent away, and <lb/>
            to invest yourself with the possession of yourself, without <lb/>
            separating off or alienating any part of it, you will have a happy <lb/>
            life, enjoying for ever and ever the fruit of good things which <lb/>
            belong not to strangers but to yourself.</p>
          <p>But now rise up also and quit speech according to utterance, <lb/>
            which Moses here represents God as calling your father's house, <lb/>
            that you may not be deceived by the specious beauty of words <lb/>
            and names, and so be separated from that real beauty which <lb/>
            exists in the things themselves which are intended by these <lb/>
            names. For it is absurd for a shadow to be looked upon as of <lb/>
            more importance than the bodies themselves, or for an <lb/>
            imitation to carry off the palm from the model. Now the <lb/>
            interpretation resembles a shadow and an imitation, but the <lb/>
            natures of things signified under these expressions, thus <lb/>
            interpreted, resemble the bodies and original models which <lb/>
            the man who aims at being such and such rather than at <lb/>
            appearing so must cling to, removing to a distance from the <lb/>
            other things.</p>
          <p>III. When therefore the mind begins to become acquainted <lb/>
            with itself, and to dwell among the speculations which come <lb/>
            under the province of the intellect, all the inclinations of the <lb/>
            soul for the species which is comprehensible by the intellect <lb/>
            will be repelled, which inclination is called by the Hebrews, <lb/>
            Lot; for which reason the wise man is represented as distinctly <lb/>
            saying, " Depart, and separate yourself from me ;"* for it is <lb/>
            impossible for a man who is overwhelmed with the love ot <lb/>
            incorporeal and imperishable objects to dwell with one, whose <lb/>
            every inclination is towards the mortal objects of the outward <lb/>
            senses.</p>
          <p>Very beautifully therefore has the sacred interpreter of <lb/>
            God's will entitled one entire holy volume of the giving of the <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xiii. 9. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="46"/>
            law, the Exodus, having thus found out an appropriate name <lb/>
            for the oracles contained therein. For being a man desirous <lb/>
            of giving instruction and exceedingly ready to admonish and <lb/>
            correct, he desires to remove the whole of the people of the <lb/>
            soul as a multitude capable of receiving admonition and <lb/>
            correction from the country of Egypt, that is to say, the body, <lb/>
            and to take them out from among its inhabitants, thinking it <lb/>
            a most terrible and grievous burden that the mind which is <lb/>
            endowed with the faculty of sight should be oppressed by the <lb/>
            pleasures of the flesh, and should obey whatever commands <lb/>
            the relentless desires choose to impose upon it.</p>
          <p>Therefore, after the merciful God has instructed this people, <lb/>
            groaning and bitterly weeping for the abundance of the things <lb/>
            concerning the body, and the exceeding supply of external <lb/>
            things (for it is said, “ The children of Israel groaned by <lb/>
            reason of the works ")* when, God, I say, had instructed them <lb/>
            about their going out, the prophet himself led them forth in <lb/>
            safety.</p>
          <p>But there are some persons who have made a treaty with the <lb/>
            body to last till the day of their death, and who have buried <lb/>
            themselves in it as in a chest or coffin or whatever else you <lb/>
            like to call it, of whom all the parts which are devoted to the <lb/>
            slavery of the body and of the passions are consigned to <lb/>
            oblivion and buried. But if anything well affected towards <lb/>
            virtue has shot up by the side of it, that is preserved in the <lb/>
            recollection, by means of which good things are naturally <lb/>
            destined to be kept alive.</p>
          <p>IV. Accordingly, the sacred scriptures command the bones <lb/>
            of Joseph—I mean by this the only parts of such a soul as <lb/>
            were left behind, being species which know no corruption and <lb/>
            which deserve to have mention made of them-to be preserved, <lb/>
            thinking it preposterous for pure things not to be united to <lb/>
            pure things. And what is especially worthy of being mentioned <lb/>
            is this, that he believed that God would visit the race which <lb/>
            was capable of seeing,"† and would not give it up for ever and <lb/>
            ever to ignorance, that blind mistress, but would distinguish <lb/>
            between the immortal and the mortal parts of the soul, and <lb/>
            leave in Egypt those parts which were conversant about the <lb/>
            pleasures of the body and the other immoderate indulgences of <lb/>
            the passions ; but with respect to those parts which are im­ <note type="footnote"> * Exodus ii. '23. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Genesis 1. 24. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="47"/>
            perishable, would make a covenant that they should be <lb/>
            conducted onwards with those persons who were going up to <lb/>
            the cities of virtue and would further ratify this covenant with <lb/>
            an oath,</p>
          <p>What then are the parts which are imperishable ? In the first <lb/>
            place, a perfect alienation from pleasure which says, " Let us lie <lb/>
            down together,"* and let us enjoy human enjoyments; secondly, <lb/>
            presence of mind combined with fortitude, by means of which <lb/>
            the soul separates and distinguishes from one another those <lb/>
            things which by vain opinions are accounted good things, as so <lb/>
            many dreams, confessing that " the only true and accurate <lb/>
            explanations of things are to be found with God ; "f and that <lb/>
            all those imaginings, which exist in the unsteady, puffed up, <lb/>
            and arrogant life of those men who are not yet purified, but <lb/>
            who delight in those pleasures which proceed from bakers, and <lb/>
            cooks, and wine-bearers, are uncertain and indistinct; so that <lb/>
            such a man is not a subject but a ruler of Egypt, that is to say <lb/>
            of the whole region of the body ; so that " lid boasted of being <lb/>
            of the race of the Hebrews,”‡ who were accustomed to rise up <lb/>
            and leave the objects of the outward senses, and to go over to <lb/>
            those of the intellect; for the name Hebrew, being interpreted, <lb/>
            means “ one who passes over, " because he boasted that " here <lb/>
            he had done nothing.˙'§</p>
          <p>For to do nothing of those things which are thought much <lb/>
            of among the wicked, but to hate them all and reject them, is <lb/>
            praiseworthy in no slight degree ; as it is to despise immoderate <lb/>
            indulgence of the desires and all other passions; to fear God, <lb/>
            if a man is not yet capable of loving him, and even while in <lb/>
            Egypt to have a desire for real life.</p>
          <p>V. Which he who sees, marvelling at (and indeed it was <lb/>
            enough || to cause astonishment), says, “ It is a great thing for <lb/>
            me if my son Joseph is still alive, ¶ and has not died at the <lb/>
            same time with vain opinions and the body which is but a <lb/>
            lifeless carcass ; and he also confessed that “ it was the work <lb/>
            of God. ’˙✸✸ and not of any created being, that he was recognised <lb/>
            by his brethren, and so could put into commotion and agitation. <lb/>

            body which flattered themselves that they could stand firmly <lb/>
            on their own doctrines; he also said that " he had not been <lb/>
            sent away by men, but had been appointed by God "* for the <lb/>
            legitimate overseeing of the body and of all external things; <lb/>
            but there are many other things also resembling these, being <lb/>
            of a superior and more sacred kind of order; and they do not <lb/>
            endure to abide in Egypt, the house of the body, and are <lb/>
            never buried in a coffin at all, but depart to a distance outside <lb/>
            of every thing mortal, and follow the words of the lawgiver, <lb/>
            namely, Moses, who is the guide of their path.</p>
          <p>For Moses, being the nurse as it were and tutor of good <lb/>
            works, and good expressions, and good intentions, which, even <lb/>
            if at times they are mingled with those of an opposite cha­ <lb/>
            racter by reason of the somewhat confused medely which exists <lb/>
            in mortal man; are nevertheless distinguished when they <lb/>
            have passed, so that all the seeds and plants of excellence <lb/>
            may not be destroyed and perish for ever and ever. And he <lb/>
            exhorts men very vigorously to quit that which is called the <lb/>
            mother of every thing that is absurd, without any delay or <lb/>
            sluggishness, but rather using exceeding swiftness; for he <lb/>
            says that men " must sacrifice the pascha, in haste,”† and <lb/>
            the word pascha, being interpreted, means a “ passing over," in <lb/>
            order that the mind, exerting its reasonings without any doubt, <lb/>
            and also an energetic willingness and promptness, may, with­ <lb/>
            out ever turning back make a passing over from the passions, <lb/>
            to gratitude to God the Saviour, who has led it forth beyond <lb/>
            all its expectations to freedom.</p>
          <p>VI. And why do we wonder if he exhorts the man who is <lb/>
            led away by the force of unreasonable passions, neither to yield, <lb/>
            nor to allow himself to be carried away by the impetuosity of <lb/>
            its onward course, but to exert all his strength, to resist, and <lb/>
            if he is unable to resist effectually, then to flee. For the <lb/>
            second advance towards safety on the part of those who are <lb/>
            unable to make a good resistance is flight. When the occa­ <lb/>
            sion does not permit the man who is a combatant by nature, <lb/>
            and who has never been a slave of the passions, but who is <lb/>
            always undergoing the toil of resistance to every separate one <lb/>
            of them, to put forth all his powers of antagonism at all times, <lb/>
            lest from the continuance of his struggles against them he may <lb/>
            gradually contract a painful infection from them ; for there <note type="footnote"> ✶ Genesis xlv. 5. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Exodus xii. 12. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="49"/>
            have before now been many instances of men having become <lb/>
            imitators of the wickedness to which they were previously <lb/>
            antagonists, as, on the other hand, some opposers of virtue have <lb/>
            become copiers of that.</p>
          <p>And for this reason the following scripture has been given <lb/>
            to men, " Return to the land of thy father and to thy family, <lb/>
            and I will be with thee ;’˙✸which is equivalent to saying, you <lb/>
            have been a perfect wrestler for me, and you have been <lb/>
            thought worthy of the prize and crown of victory, virtue <lb/>
            having been the establisher of the contest and proposing to <lb/>
            give prizes of victory; and now get rid of your fondness for <lb/>
            contention, that you may not be always labouring but that you <lb/>
            may be able to enjoy the fruit of your labours, which will <lb/>
            never happen to you if you remain here dwelling among the <lb/>
            objects of the external senses, and wasting your time among <lb/>
            the distinctive qualities of the body, of which Laban is the <lb/>
            leader (and this name means " distinctive quality; ") but you <lb/>
            must be an emigrant and must return to your native land, the <lb/>
            land of the sacred word, and in some sense of the father of all <lb/>
            those who practise virtue, which is wisdom, the best possible <lb/>
            abiding place for those souls which love virtue.</p>
          <p>In this country you have a race which learns everything of <lb/>
            itself, and is self-taught, which has no share in the infantine <lb/>
            food of milk, but which by the divine oracle “ has been forbid­ <lb/>
            den to go down to Egypt, "t and to put itself in the way of <lb/>
            the attractive pleasures of the flesh, surnamed Isaac; and if <lb/>
            you receive his inheritance, you will of necessity discard labour, <lb/>
            for excessive abundance of things ready prepared, and of good <lb/>
            things offered to your hand, will be the causes of cessation <lb/>
            from toil. And the fountain from which good things are poured <lb/>
            forth is the presence of the bounteous and beneficent God; <lb/>
            on which account setting the seal to his loving kindnesses he <lb/>
            says, “ I will be with thee."</p>
          <p>VII. How then should any good thing be wanting when <lb/>
            the all-accomplishing God is at all times present with his <lb/>
            graces, which are his virgin daughters, which he, the Father, <lb/>
            who begot them, always cherishes as virgins, free from all im­ <lb/>
            pure contact and pollution ? Then all cares, and labours, and <lb/>
            exercises of practice, have a respite; and everything that is <lb/>
            useful is at the same time given to everybody without the em­ <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xxxi. 3. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Genesis xxvi. 2. </note> <note type="footnote"> VOL. II. </note> <note type="footnote"> E </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="50"/>
            ployment of art, by the prescient care of nature; and the <lb/>
            rapid influx of all these spontaneous blessings is called relax­ <lb/>
            ation, since the mind is then relaxed and released from its <lb/>
            energies as to its own peculiar objects, and is as it were eman­ <lb/>
            cipated from its yearly burdens,* by reason of the multitude of <lb/>
            the things which are incessantly showered and rained upon it; <lb/>
            and these things are in their own nature most admirable and <lb/>
            most beautiful; for of the things of which the soul is in travail <lb/>
            by herself, the greater part are premature and abortive pro­ <lb/>
            geny ; but those on which God pours his showers and which <lb/>
            he waters, are produced in a perfect, and entire, and most <lb/>
            excellent state.</p>
          <p>I am not ashamed to relate what has happened to me <lb/>
            myself, which I know from having experienced it ten thou­ <lb/>
            sand times. Sometimes, when I have desired to come to my <lb/>
            usual employment of writing on the doctrines of philosophy, <lb/>
            though I have known accurately what it was proper to set <lb/>
            down, I have found my mind barren and unproductive, and <lb/>
            have been completely unsuccessful in my object, being indig­ <lb/>
            nant at my mind for the uncertainty and vanity of its then <lb/>
            existing opinions, and filled with amazement at the power of <lb/>
            the living God, by whom the womb of the soul is at times <lb/>
            opened and at times closed up; and sometimes when I have <lb/>
            come to my work empty I have suddenly become full, ideas <lb/>
            being, in an invisible manner, showered upon me, and im­ <lb/>
            planted in me from on high; so that, through the influence of <lb/>
            divine inspiration, I have become greatly excited, and have <lb/>
            known neither the place in which I was nor those who were <lb/>
            present, nor myself, nor what I was saying, nor what I was <lb/>
            writing; for then I have been conscious of a richness of inter­ <lb/>
            pretation, an enjoyment of light, a most penetrating sight, a <lb/>
            most manifest energy in all that was to be done, having such <lb/>
            an effect on my mind as the clearest ocular demonstration <lb/>
            would have on the eyes.</p>
          <p>VIII. That then which is shown is that thing so worthy of <lb/>
            being beheld, so worthy of being contemplated, so worthy of <lb/>
            being beloved, the perfect good, the nature of which is to <lb/>
            change and sweeten the bitternesses of the soul, the most <note type="footnote"> ✶ Here again Mangey supposes the text to be hopelessly corrupt. <lb/>
            The word there is <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἑκονσίων</foreign>, for which he proposes and translates <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">νύρτων τω</foreign> v <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐτησίων</foreign>. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="51"/>
            beautiful additional seasoning, full of all kinds of sweetnesses, <lb/>
            by the addition of which, even those things which are not <lb/>
            nutritious become salutary food; for it is said, that “ the <lb/>
            Lord showed him (Moses) a tree, and he cast it into the <lb/>
            water,"* that is to say, into the mind, dissolved, and relaxed, <lb/>
            and full of bitterness, that it might become sweetened and <lb/>
            serviceable. But this tree promises not only food but likewise <lb/>
            immortality; for Moses tells us, that the tree of life was <lb/>
            planted in the midst of the paradise, being, in fact, goodness <lb/>
            surrounded as by a body-guard by all the particular virtues, <lb/>
            and by the actions in accordance with them ; for it is virtue <lb/>
            which has received the inheritance of the most central and <lb/>
            excellent place in the soul.</p>
          <p>And he who sees is the wise man; for the foolish are blind, <lb/>
            or at best dim sighted. On this account I have before men <lb/>
            tioned, that the then prophets were called seers ;f and Jacob, <lb/>
            the practiser of virtue, was desirous to give his ears in ex­ <lb/>
            change for his eyes, if he could only see what he had <lb/>
            previously heard described, and accordingly he receives an <lb/>
            inheritance according to sight, having passed over that which <lb/>
            was derived from hearing; for the coin of learning and in­ <lb/>
            struction, which is synonymous with Jacob, is re-coined into <lb/>
            the seeing Israel, in consequence of which he, the faculty of <lb/>
            seeing, beholds the divine light, which is in no respect dif­ <lb/>
            ferent from knowledge, which opens the eye of the soul, and <lb/>
            leads it on to embrace the most conspicuous and manifest <lb/>
            comprehension of existing things ‡ for as it is through music <lb/>
            that the principles of music are understood, and through each <lb/>
            separate art that its principles are comprehended, so also it is <lb/>
            owing to wisdom that what is wise is contemplated : but not <lb/>
            only is wisdom like light, the instrument of seeing, but it does <lb/>
            also behold itself. This, in God, is the light which is the <lb/>
            archetypal model of the sun, and the sun itself is only its <lb/>
            image and copy; and he who shows each thing is the only <lb/>
            all-knowing being, God; for men are called knowing only <lb/>
            because they appear to know; but God, who really does know, <lb/>
            is spoken of, as to his knowledge, in a manner inferior to its <note type="footnote"> * Exodus xv. 25. </note> <note type="footnote"> t 1 Samuel ix. 9. </note> <note type="footnote"> ‡ This again is Mangey's emendation. The Greek text has <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὤτιον</foreign>, <lb/>
            which is either nonsense, or at least the opposite of what must be <lb/>
            meant. </note> <note type="footnote"> E 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="52"/>
            real nature, for everything that is ever spoken in his praise <lb/>
            comes short of the real power of the living God.</p>
          <p>And he recommends his wisdom, not merely by the fact <lb/>
            that it was he who created the world, but also by that of his <lb/>
            having established the knowledge of .everything that has hap­ <lb/>
            pened, or that has been created in the firmest manner close <lb/>
            to himself; for it is said, that " God saw all the things that <lb/>
            he had made,"* which is an expression equivalent not to, He <lb/>
            directed his sight towards each thing, but to, He conceived a <lb/>
            knowledge, and understanding, and comprehension, of all the <lb/>
            things that he had made. It was very proper, therefore, to <lb/>
            teach and to instruct, and to point out to the ignorant, each <lb/>
            separate thing, but it was unnecessary to do so to the all- <lb/>
            knowing God, who is not like a man, benefited by art, but <lb/>
            who is himself confessed to be the beginning and source of all <lb/>
            arts and sciences.</p>
          <p>IX. And Moses speaks very cautiously, inasmuch as he <lb/>
            defines not the present time but the future in the promise <lb/>
            which he records, when he says, “ Not that which I do show <lb/>
            you, but that which I will show you;”† as a testimony to the <lb/>
            faith with which the soul believed in God, showing its gratitude <lb/>
            not by what had been already done, but by its expectation of <lb/>
            the future ; for, being kept in a state of suspense and eager­ <lb/>
            ness by good hope, and thinking that even what was not <lb/>
            present would beyond all question be present immediately, on <lb/>
            account of its most certain faith in him who had promised, <lb/>
            it found a reward, the perfect good; for in another passage it <lb/>
            is said that Abraham believed in God.</p>
          <p>And in the same way, God, when showing Moses all the <lb/>
            land, says that, " I have shown it to thy eyes, but thou shalt <lb/>
            not enter therein,"t Do not then fancy that this is spoken <lb/>
            of the death of the all-wise Moses, as some inconsiderate <lb/>
            persons believe ; for it is a piece of folly to think that slaves <lb/>
            should have the country of virtue assigned to them in <lb/>
            preference to the friends of God. But first of all, God wishes <lb/>
            to make it understood by you that there is one place for <lb/>
            infants and another for full-grown men, the one being called <lb/>
            practice and the other wisdom ; and secondly, that the most <lb/>
            beautiful of all the things in nature are rather such as can be <lb/>
            seen than such as can be acquired ; for how can it be possible <note type="footnote"> * Genesis i. 31. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Genesis xv. 5. </note> <note type="footnote"> ‡ Deut. xxxiv. 4. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="53"/>
            to acquire possession of those things which are endowed in the <lb/>
            same degree with the diviner attributes ? But it is not impos­ <lb/>
            sible to see them, though it may not be given to all men to do <lb/>
            so, for this may be permitted only to the purest and most <lb/>
            acute-sighted race, to whom the father of the universe, when <lb/>
            he displays his own works, is giving the greatest of all <lb/>
            gifts.</p>
          <p>For what life can be better than that which is devoted to <lb/>
            speculation, or what can be more closely connected with <lb/>
            rational existence ; for which reason it is that though the <lb/>
            voices of mortal beings are judged of by the faculty of hearing, <lb/>
            nevertheless the scriptures present to us the words of God, to <lb/>
            be actually visible to us like light; for in them it is said that, <lb/>
            .. All the people saw the voice of God;”* they do not say, <lb/>
            .. heard it," since what took place was not a beating of the air <lb/>
            by means of the organs of the mouth and tongue, but a most <lb/>
            exceedingly brilliant ray of virtue, not different in any respect <lb/>
            from the source of reason, which also in another passage is <lb/>
            spoken of in the following manner, " Ye have seen that I <lb/>
            spake unto you from out of heaven,”† not "Ye have heard," <lb/>
            for the same reason.</p>
          <p>But there are passages where he distinguishes between what <lb/>
            is heard and what is seen, and between the sense of seeing and <lb/>
            that of hearing, as where he says, " Ye heard the sound of the <lb/>
            words, but ye saw no similitude, only ye heard a voice <lb/>
            speaking here with excessive precision; for the discourse <lb/>
            which was divided into nouns and verbs, and in short into all <lb/>
            the different parts of speech, he has very appropriately spoken <lb/>
            of as something to be heard; for in fact that is examined by <lb/>
            the sense of hearing; but that which has nothing to do with <lb/>
            either nouns or verbs, but is the voice of God, and seen by <lb/>
            the eye of the soul, he very properly represents as visible; <lb/>
            and having previously reminded them, " Ye saw no similitude," <lb/>
            he proceeds to say, “ Only ye heard a voice, which ye all saw;" <lb/>
            for this must be what is understood as implied in those words. <lb/>
            So that the words of God have for their tribunal and judge the <lb/>
            sense of sight, which is situated in the soul: but those which <lb/>
            are subdivided into nouns, and verbs, and other parts of speech, <lb/>
            have for their judge the sense of hearing.</p>
          <p>But as the writer being new in all kinds of knowledge, has <note type="footnote"> * Exodus xx. 18. </note> <note type="footnote"> † Exodus xx. 22. </note> <note type="footnote"> ‡ Deut. iv. 12. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="54"/>
            also introduced this novelty both in his accounts of domestic <lb/>
            and of foreign matters, saying that the voice is a thing to be <lb/>
            judged of by the sight, which in point of fact is almost the <lb/>
            only thing in us which is not an object of sight, with the single <lb/>
            exception of the mind ; for the things which are the objects ot <lb/>
            the rest of the outward senses are, every one of them, visible <lb/>
            to the sight, such as colours, tastes, smells, things that are hot <lb/>
            or cold, things that are smooth or rough, things that are soft <lb/>
            or hard, inasmuch as they are substantial bodies. And what <lb/>
            is meant by this I will explain more distinctly : a flavour is <lb/>
            appreciable by the sight, not inasmuch as it is flavour, but so <lb/>
            far as it is a mere substance, for in so far as it is flavour the <lb/>
            sense of taste will judge of it; again a smell, in so far as it is <lb/>
            a smell, will be decided upon by the nostrils, but inasmuch as <lb/>
            it is a bodily substance, it will also be judged of by the eyes : <lb/>
            and the other objects of sense will be tested in this manner; <lb/>
            but voice is not appreciable by the sense of sight, neither <lb/>
            inasmuch as it is a body, if indeed it is a body at all, nor <lb/>
            inasmuch as it can be heard ; but there are these two things <lb/>
            in us which are wholly invisible-mind and speech ; but the <lb/>
            sound that proceeds from us does not the least resemble the <lb/>
            divine organ of voice ; for one organ of voice is mingled with <lb/>
            the air, and flies to a kindred region with itself, namely to the <lb/>
            ears ; but the divine organ consists of unmixed and unalloyed <lb/>
            speech, which outstrips the sense of hearing by reason of its <lb/>
            fineness, and which is discerned by a pure soul, by means of <lb/>
            its acuteness in the faculty of sight.</p>
          <p>X. Therefore, after having left all mortal things, God, as I <lb/>
            have said before, gives, as his first gift to the soul, an exhibition <lb/>
            and an opportunity of contemplating mortal things: and in the <lb/>
            second place he gives it an improvement in the doctrines of <lb/>
            virtue, in respect both of their numbers and of their im­ <lb/>
            portance; for he says, "And I will make thee into a mighty <lb/>
            nation," using this expression with reference to the multitude <lb/>
            of the nation, and with reference to the increase and im­ <lb/>
            provement of what was already great; and that this quantity <lb/>
            in each kind, that is to say, both as to magnitude and as <lb/>
            to number, was greatly increased, is pointed out by the king of <lb/>
            Egypt, where he says, “For behold," says he, .. the race of the <lb/>
            children of Israel is a great multitude."* <note type="footnote"> * Exodus i. 9. </note> <pb n="55"/>
            </p>
          <p>Since both these facts bear witness to the race which had <lb/>
            the power of beholding the living God, that it had derived <lb/>
            increase both in number and in magnitude, and as having <lb/>
            done so, had met with prosperity, both in its life and in its <lb/>
            language ; for he does not say here (as any one would say who <lb/>
            paid attention to the connection of the words which he was <lb/>
            using), a numerous multitude, but he says, "A great multitude," <lb/>
            knowing that the word numerous by itself implies an im­ <lb/>
            perfect multitude, unless in addition to its numbers it has the <lb/>
            attributes of intelligence and knowledge; for what advantage is <lb/>
            it to comprehend many subjects of speculation, unless each <lb/>
            of them receives a power of growth to a suitable size; for in <lb/>
            like manner a field is not perfect in which there are in­ <lb/>
            numerable plants growing on the ground, and no plant has <lb/>
            grown up by means of the skill of the husbandman so as to <lb/>
            arrive at perfection, unless it is now able to produce fruit.</p>
          <p>But the beginning and the end of the greatness and <lb/>
            numerousness of good things is the ceaseless and uninterrupted <lb/>
            recollection of God, and an invocation of his assistance in the <lb/>
            civil and domestic, confused and continual, warfare of life ; <lb/>
            for Moses says, " Behold, the people is wise and full of <lb/>
            knowledge; this is a mighty nation; for what nation is there so <lb/>
            great, that has God so near, as the Lord our God is to us in <lb/>
            all the circumstances in which we call upon him?”* Therefore <lb/>
            it has been plainly shown that there is power with God, <lb/>
            which is a suitable and useful helper and defender, and the <lb/>
            ruler himself comes nearer to the assistance of those persons <lb/>
            who are worthy to be assisted.</p>
          <p>XI. But who are they who are worthy to obtain such a <lb/>
            mercy as this ? It is plain that they are all lovers of wisdom <lb/>
            and knowledge; for these are the wise people and the people <lb/>
            of knowledge of whom he speaks, each of whom may naturally <lb/>
            be called great, since he aims at great things, and at one great <lb/>
            thing with excessive earnestness and eagerness, namely, at <lb/>
            never being separated from the Almighty God, but at being <lb/>
            able to endure his approach when he comes near steadily, and <lb/>
            without any amazement or display.</p>
          <p>This is the definition of great, to be near to God, or at least <lb/>
            to be near to that thing to which God is near; forsooth the <lb/>
            world and the wise citizen of the world are both full of many <note type="footnote"> to Deuteronomy iv. 6. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="56"/>
            and great good things, but all the rest of the multitude of <lb/>
            men is involved in numerous evils, and in but few good things; <lb/>
            for the good is rare in the agitated and confused life of man. <lb/>
            On which account it is said in the sacred scriptures, " It is not <lb/>
            because you are numerous beyond all the nations that the <lb/>
            Lord has selected you above them all, and has chosen you out; <lb/>
            for in truth you are but few in comparison of all nations, but it <lb/>
            is because the Lord loves you;"* for if any one were to choose <lb/>
            to distribute the multitude of one soul as if according to <lb/>
            nations, he would find a great many ranks totally destitute of <lb/>
            all order, of which pleasures, or appetites or griefs, or fears, or <lb/>
            again follies and iniquities, and all the other vices which are <lb/>
            connected with or akin to them, are the leaders, and he would <lb/>
            find but one rank alone well regulated, that namely which is <lb/>
            under the leadership of right reason,</p>
          <p>Among men, then, the unjust multitude is usually honoured <lb/>
            more than one single just person ; but in the eye of God a <lb/>
            small company that is good is preferred to an infinite number <lb/>
            of persons who are unjust. And, on that account, he warns <lb/>
            men never to consent to a multitude of such a character; <lb/>
            “ For," says he, “ thou shalt not join with a multitude to do <lb/>
            evil." t May one, then, join a few to do so ? One may never <lb/>
            join a single bad man. But a bad man, though he be hut a <lb/>
            single individual, is a multitude in wickedness, and it is the <lb/>
            greatest possible evil to join with him ; for, on the contrary, it <lb/>
            is becoming rather to oppose him and to make war upon him <lb/>
            with fearless energy. “ For if," says Moses, “you go forth to <lb/>
            war against your enemies and see a horse," the emblem of arro­ <lb/>
            gant and restive passion which scorns all control, " and a rider," <lb/>
            the symbol of the mind devoted to the service of the passions, <lb/>
            riding upon it, " and a great body of your people," admirers of <lb/>
            those before-mentioned passions, and following in a solid <lb/>
            phalanx, "you shall not be terrified so as to flee from them," <lb/>
            for you, though only a single person, shall have a single being <lb/>
            for your ally, " because the Lord your God is on your side ;”‡ <lb/>
            for his advance to battle puts an end to war, builds up peace <lb/>
            again, overthrows numbers of long-accustomed evils, preserves <lb/>
            the scanty race which loves God, to whom every one who be­ <lb/>
            comes subject hates and abominates the ranks of the more <lb/>
            earthly armies. <note type="footnote"> * Deut. vii. 7. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Exodus xxiii. 2. </note> <note type="footnote"> ‡ Dent. xx 1. </note> <pb n="57"/>
             </p>
          <p>XII. "For," says Moses, "you shall not eat those animals <lb/>
            which have a multitude of feet, being numbered among all the <lb/>
            reptiles that are upon the earth; because they are an abomina­ <lb/>
            tion."* But the soul is not deserving of being hated which <lb/>
            goes upon the earth in one part of itself, but only that which <lb/>
            does so with all or with the greatest proportion of its parts, <lb/>
            and which is exceedingly greedy about the things of the body, <lb/>
            and which, in short, is unable to penetrate into and contem­ <lb/>
            plate the divine revolutions of the heaven. And, moreover, as <lb/>
            the animal with many feet is accursed among reptiles, so also is <lb/>
            that which has no feet at all; the one for the cause already <lb/>
            mentioned, and the other because it entirely falls upon the <lb/>
            ground in all its parts, not being supported off the ground by <lb/>
            anything, not even for the briefest minute.</p>
          <p>For Moses says that, " Everything which goes upon its belly <lb/>
            is unclean ;”† meaning, under this figurative expression, to <lb/>
            point out those who pursue the pleasures of the belly. But <lb/>
            some going far beyond these persons in wickedness, not only <lb/>
            indulge in every description of desire, but also acquire that <lb/>
            passion which is akin to desire, namely, anger, wishing to <lb/>
            excite the whole of the irrational part of the soul and to destroy <lb/>
            the mind. For what has been said in words, indeed, is appli <lb/>
            cable to the serpent, but in reality it is meant to apply to every <lb/>
            man who is irrational and a slave to his passions, being truly a <lb/>
            divine oracle, " Upon thy breast and upon thy belly shalt thou <lb/>
            go for anger has its abode about the breast, and the seat of <lb/>
            desire is in the belly. But the foolish man proceeds always by <lb/>
            means of the two passions together, both anger and desire, <lb/>
            omitting no opportunity, and discarding reason as his pilot and <lb/>
            Judge.</p>
          <p>But the man who is contrary to him has extirpated anger <lb/>
            and desire from his nature, and has enlisted himself under <lb/>
            divine reason as his guide ; as also Moses, that faithful servant <lb/>
            of God, did. Who, when he is offering the burnt offerings of <lb/>
            the soul, " washes out the belly ;"§ that is to say, he washes out <lb/>
            the whole seat of desires, and he takes away " the breast of the <lb/>
            ram of the consecration ;" || that is to say, the whole of the war­ <lb/>
            like disposition, that so the remainder, the better portion of <lb/>
            the soul, the rational part, having no longer anything to draw <note type="footnote"> * Leviticus xi. 42. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Leviticus xi. 43. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Genesis iiL 14. </note> <note type="footnote"> § Exodus xxix. 26. </note> <note type="footnote"> || Leviticus VIII.29. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="58"/>
            it in a different direction or to counteract its natural impulses, <lb/>
            may indulge its own free and noble inclinations towards every­ <lb/>
            thing that is beautiful ; for, in this way, it will improve both in <lb/>
            quantity and in magnitude. For it is said, " How long shall <lb/>
            this people exasperate me ? and till what time will they refuse <lb/>
            to believe me in all the signs which I have done among them ? <lb/>
            I will smite them with death and I will destroy them, and I <lb/>
            will make thee and thy father's house into a mighty nation, <lb/>
            greater and mightier than this."*</p>
          <p>For when the great multitude of the passions which indulge <lb/>
            in anger and desire in the soul is put to the rout, then imme­ <lb/>
            diately those affections which depend on its rational nature rise <lb/>
            up and become brilliant; for as the reptile with many feet and <lb/>
            that with no feet at all, though they are exactly opposite to <lb/>
            one another in the race of reptiles, are both pronounced un­ <lb/>
            clean, so also the opinion which denies any God, and that <lb/>
            which worships a multitude of Gods, though quite opposite in <lb/>
            the soul, are both profane. And a proof of this is that the law <lb/>
            banishes them both from the sacred assembly,"t forbidding <lb/>
            the atheistical opinion, as a eunuch and mutilated person, to <lb/>
            come into the assembly; and the polytheistic, inasmuch as it <lb/>
            prohibits any one born of a harlot from either hearing or speak­ <lb/>
            ing in the assembly. For he who worships no God at all is <lb/>
            barren, and he who worships a multitude is the son of a <lb/>
            harlot, who is in a state of blindness as to his true father, and <lb/>
            who on this account is figuratively spoken of as having many <lb/>
            fathers, instead of one.</p>
          <p>XIII. There have now been two gifts of God already men­ <lb/>
            tioned : the hope of a life devoted to contemplation, and an <lb/>
            improvement in good things in respect both of quantity and of <lb/>
            magnitude. The third gift is blessing, without which it is not <lb/>
            possible that the graces already mentioned can be confirmed ; <lb/>
            for the scripture says, "And I will bless thee ;” that is to say, I <lb/>
            will give thee a word which shall be praised; for the portion <foreign xml:lang="grc">εὖ</foreign> <lb/>
            (in <foreign xml:lang="grc">εὐλογήσω</foreign>, I will bless), is always applicable to virtue. And <lb/>
            of speech, one kind is like a spring and another kind is like a <lb/>
            stream ; that which is in the mind being like the spring, and <lb/>
            the utterance through the medium of the mouth and tongue <lb/>
            resembling a stream. And it is great riches for either species <lb/>
            of speech to be improved, for the mind to be so by exerting <note type="footnote"> * Numbers xiv. 11. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Deuteronomy xxiii. 2. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="59"/>
            soundness of reason in everything, whether important or unim­ <lb/>
            portant, or for the utterance to be so when under the guidance <lb/>
            of right instruction; for many men think, indeed, most excel­ <lb/>
            lently, but are betrayed by a bad interpreter, namely, speech, <lb/>
            because they have not throughly worked up the whole course <lb/>
            of encyclical instruction. Others, again, have been exceedingly <lb/>
            skilful in explaining their ideas, but very bad hands at forming <lb/>
            intentions, as, for instance, those who are called sophists, for <lb/>
            the mind of these sophists is destitute of all harmony and of all <lb/>
            real learning; but their speeches, which are uttered by the <lb/>
            organs of their voice, are full of music and beauty.</p>
          <p>But God gives no imperfect gifts to his subjects, but all his <lb/>
            presents are complete and perfect. On which account he now <lb/>
            dispenses blessing not to one section only, that of speech, but <lb/>
            to both portions ; thinking it proper that the man who has re­ <lb/>
            ceived a benefit should also conceive the most excellent notions, <lb/>
            and should also be able to explain what he has conceived in a <lb/>
            powerful manner; for perfection, as it seems, consists in the <lb/>
            two points, of being able to form clear and just conceptions and <lb/>
            intentions, and also of being able to interpret them correctly. <lb/>
            Do you not see that Abel (and the name Abel is the name of <lb/>
            one who mourns over mortal things, and attributes happiness <lb/>
            to immortal things), has a mind wholly free from all liability <lb/>
            to reproach ? And yet, from not being practised in discussions, <lb/>
            he is defeated by one who is clever as an antagonist in such <lb/>
            things, Cain being able to get the better of him more through <lb/>
            superiority of skill than of strength ; for which reason, though <lb/>
            I admire him on account of the good fortune with which he <lb/>
            was endowed by nature, I nevertheless blame the disposition in <lb/>
            him that, when he was challenged to a contest of discussion, he <lb/>
            came forward to contend, when he ought to have abided by his <lb/>
            usual tranquillity, discarding all love for contention. But if <lb/>
            he was determined by all means to enter into such a contest, <lb/>
            then still he ought not to have engaged in it until he had <lb/>
            sufficiently practised himself in the exercises of the art; for men <lb/>
            who have been long versed in political strife are usually accus­ <lb/>
            tomed to get the better of men of uncultivated acuteness.</p>
          <p>XIV. For this reason also the all-accomplished Moses <lb/>
            deprecates coming to a consideration of reasonable looking <lb/>
            and plausible arguments, from the time that God began to <lb/>
            cause the light of truth to shine upon him; through the <lb/>
             <pb n="60"/>
            immortal words of his knowledge and wisdom. But he is not <lb/>
            the less led on to the contemplation of these arguments, not <lb/>
            for the sake of becoming skilful in many things (for the <lb/>
            contemplation of God himself and of his most sacred powers, <lb/>
            are quite sufficient for a man who is fond of contemplation), <lb/>
            but with a view to get the better of the sophists in Egypt, <lb/>
            where fabulous and plausible inventions are looked upon as <lb/>
            entitled to higher honour than a clear statement of truth.</p>
          <p>When, therefore, the mind walks abroad among the affairs <lb/>
            of the ruler of the universe, it requires nothing further as an <lb/>
            object of contemplation, since the mind alone is the most <lb/>
            piercing of all eyes as applied to the objects of the intellect; <lb/>
            but when it is directed towards those things which are <lb/>
            properly objects of the outward senses, or to any passion, or <lb/>
            substance, of which the land of Egypt is the emblem, then it <lb/>
            will have need of skill and power in argument. On which <lb/>
            account Moses is directed also to take Aaron with him as an <lb/>
            addition, Aaron being the symbol of uttered speech, "Behold," <lb/>
            says God, "is not Aaron thy brother?"* For one rational <lb/>
            nature being the mother of them both, it follows of course <lb/>
            that the offspring are brothers, "I know that he will speak." <lb/>
            For it is the office of the mind to comprehend, and of <lb/>
            utterance to speak. "He," says God, "will speak for thee." <lb/>
            For the mind not being able to give an adequate exposition of <lb/>
            the part which is assigned to it, uses its neighbour speech as <lb/>
            an interpreter, for the purpose of explaining what it feels.</p>
          <p>Presently he further adds, " Behold he will come to meet <lb/>
            thee," since in truth speech when it meets the conceptions, <lb/>
            and embodies them in words, and names stamps what had <lb/>
            before no impression on it, so as to make it current coin. And <lb/>
            further on he says, "And when he seeth thee he will rejoice <lb/>
            in himself;" for speech rejoices and exults when the <lb/>
            conception is not indistinct, because it being clear and evident <lb/>
            employs speech as an unerring and fluent expositor of itself, <lb/>
            having a full supply of appropriate and felicitous expressions <lb/>
            full of abundant distinctness and intelligibility.</p>
          <p>XV. At all events when the conceptions are at all <lb/>
            indistinct and ambiguous, speech is the treading as it were on <lb/>
            empty air, and often stumbles and meets with a severe fall, so <lb/>
            as never to be able to rise again. “ And thou shalt speak to <note type="footnote"> * Exodus iv. 14. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="61"/>
            him, and thou shalt give my words into his mouth," which is <lb/>
            equivalent to, Thou shalt suggest to him conceptions which <lb/>
            are in no respect different from divine language and divine <lb/>
            arguments. For without some one to offer suggestions, speech <lb/>
            will not speak; and the mind is what suggests to speech, as <lb/>
            God suggests to the mind. "And he shall speak for thee to <lb/>
            the people, and he shall be thy mouth, and thou shalt be to <lb/>
            him as God. " And there is a most emphatic meaning in the <lb/>
            expression, " He shall speak for thee, " that is to say, He shall <lb/>
            interpret thy conceptions, and He shall be thy mouth." For <lb/>
            the stream of speech being borne through the tongue and <lb/>
            mouth conveys the conceptions abroad. But speech is the <lb/>
            interpreter of the mind to men, while again mind is by means <lb/>
            of speech the interpreter to God; but these thoughts are <lb/>
            those of which God alone is the overseer.</p>
          <p>Therefore it is necessary for any one who is about to enter <lb/>
            into a contest of sophistry, to pay attention to all his words <lb/>
            with such vigorous earnestness, that he may not only be able <lb/>
            to escape from the manoeuvres of his adversaries, but may also <lb/>
            in his turn attack them, and get the better of them, both in <lb/>
            skill and in power. Do you not see that conjurors and <lb/>
            enchanters, who attempting to contend against the divine word <lb/>
            with their sophistries, and who daring to endeavour to do other <lb/>
            things of a similar kind, labour not so much to display their <lb/>
            own knowledge, as to tear to pieces and turn into ridicule what <lb/>
            was done?* For they even transform their rods into the nature <lb/>
            of serpents, and change water into the complexion of blood, <lb/>
            and by their incantations they attract the remainder of the <lb/>
            frogs to the land, and, like miserable men as they are, they <lb/>
            increase everything for their own destruction, and while <lb/>
            thinking to deceive others they are deceived themselves. And <lb/>
            how was it possible for Moses to encounter such men as these <lb/>
            unless he had prepared speech, the interpreter of his mind, <lb/>
            namely Aaron? who now indeed is called his mouth; but in <lb/>
            a subsequent passage we shall find that he is called a prophet, <lb/>
            when also the mind, being under the influence of divine <lb/>
            inspiration, is called God.</p>
          <p>" For," says God, " I give thee as a God to Pharaoh, and <lb/>
            Aaron thy brother shall be thy prophet."! 0 the harmonious <lb/>
            and well-organised consequence! For that which interprets <note type="footnote"> * Exodus vii. 12. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Exodus vii. 1-</note> <lb/>
             <pb n="62"/>
            the will of God is the prophetical race, being under the <lb/>
            influence of divine possession and frenzy. Therefore “ the rod <lb/>
            of Aaron swallowed up their rods,"* as the holy scripture tells <lb/>
            us. For all sophistical reasons are swallowed up and destroyed <lb/>
            by the varied skilfulness of nature; so that they are forced to <lb/>
            confess that what is done is .. the finger of God,”† an expression <lb/>
            equivalent to confessing the truth of the divine scripture <lb/>
            which asserts that sophistry is always subdued by wisdom. <lb/>
            For the sacred account tells us that " the tables" on which the <lb/>
            commandments were engraved as on a pillar, "were also <lb/>
            written by the finger of God. ”‡ On which account the con­ <lb/>
            jurors were not able to stand before Moses, but fell down as in <lb/>
            a wrestling match, being overcome by the superior strength <lb/>
            of their antagonist.</p>
          <p>XVI. What then is the fourth gift? The having a great <lb/>
            name, for God says, "I will magnify thy name;”§ and the <lb/>
            meaning of this, as it appears to me, is as follows ; as to be <lb/>
            good is honourable, so also to appear to be so is advantageous. <lb/>
            And truth is better than appearance, but perfect happiness is <lb/>
            when the two are combined. For there are great numbers of <lb/>
            people who apply themselves to virtue in genuine honesty and <lb/>
            sincerity, and who admire its genuine beauty, having no regard <lb/>
            to the reputation which they may have with the multitude, <lb/>
            and who in consequence have been plotted against, being <lb/>
            thought wicked though in reality they are good. And indeed <lb/>
            there is no advantage whatever in seeming, unless being has <lb/>
            also been added long before, as is the case with respect to <lb/>
            bodies ; for if all men were to fancy that one who was labouring <lb/>
            under a disease was in good health, or that one in good health <lb/>
            was labouring under a disease, still their opinion would not of <lb/>
            itself create either disease or good health. But the man to <lb/>
            whom God has given both things, namely both to be good and <lb/>
            virtuous and also to appear so, that man is truly happy, and <lb/>
            has a name which is really magnified. And one must have a <lb/>
            prudent regard for a good reputation as a thing of great <lb/>
            importance, and one which greatly benefits the life which is <lb/>
            dependent on the body. And it falls to the lot of every <lb/>
            one who, rejoicing with contentment, changes none of the <note type="footnote"> * Exodus vii. 12. </note><note type="footnote"> ‡ Exodus XXXII. 16. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Exodus viii 19. </note><note type="footnote"> § Genesis xii. 2. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="63"/>
            existing laws, but zealously preserves the constitution of his <lb/>
            native land.</p>
          <p>For there are some men, who, looking upon written laws as <lb/>
            symbols of things appreciable by the intellect, have studied <lb/>
            some things with superfluous accuracy, and have treated others <lb/>
            with neglectful indifference ; whom I should blame for their <lb/>
            levity ; for they ought to attend to both classes of things, <lb/>
            applying themselves both to an accurate investigation of <lb/>
            invisible things, and also to an irreproachable observance of <lb/>
            those laws which are notorious. But now men living solitarily <lb/>
            by themselves as if they were in a desert, or else as if they <lb/>
            were mere souls unconnected with the body, and as if they had <lb/>
            no knowledge of any city, or village, or house, or in short of <lb/>
            any company of men whatever, overlook what appears to the <lb/>
            many to be true, and seek for plain maked truth by itself, <lb/>
            whom the sacred scripture teaches not to neglect a good <lb/>
            reputation, and not to break through any established customs <lb/>
            which divine men of greater wisdom than any in our time <lb/>
            have enacted or established. For although the seventh day is <lb/>
            a lesson to teach us the power which exists in the uncreated <lb/>
            God, and also that the creature is entitled to rest from his <lb/>
            labours, it does not follow that on that account we may <lb/>
            abrogate the laws which are established respecting it, so as to <lb/>
            light a fire, or till land, or carry burdens, or bring accusations, <lb/>
            or conduct suits at law, or demand a restoration of a deposit, <lb/>
            or exact the repayment of a debt, or do any other of the <lb/>
            things which are usually permitted at times which are not days <lb/>
            of festival. Nor does it follow, because the feast is the <lb/>
            symbol of the joy of the soul and of its gratitude towards <lb/>
            God, that we are to repudiate the assemblies ordained at the <lb/>
            periodical seasons of the year; nor because the rite of <lb/>
            circumcision is an emblem of the excision of pleasures and of <lb/>
            all the passions, and of the destruction of that impious opinion, <lb/>
            according to which the mind has imagined itself to be by <lb/>
            itself competent to produce offspring, does it follow that we <lb/>
            are to annul the law which has been enacted about circumcision. <lb/>
            Since we shall neglect the laws about the due observance of <lb/>
            the ceremonies in the temple, and numbers of others too, if <lb/>
            we exclude all figurative interpretation and attend only to <lb/>
            those things which are expressly ordained in plain words.</p>
          <p>But it is right to think that this class of things resembles <lb/>
             <pb n="64"/>
            the body, and the other class the soul; therefore, just as we <lb/>
            take care of the body because it is the abode of the soul, so <lb/>
            also must we take care of the laws that are enacted in plain <lb/>
            terms : for while they are regarded, those other things also <lb/>
            will be more clearly understood, of which these laws are the <lb/>
            symbols, and in the same way one will escape blame and accu­ <lb/>
            sation from men in general. Do you not see that Abraham <lb/>
            also says, that both small and great blessings fell to the share of <lb/>
            the wise man, and he calls the great things, " all that he had," <lb/>
            and his possessions, which it is allowed to the legitimate son <lb/>
            alone to receive as his inheritance; but the small things he <lb/>
            calls gifts, of which the illegitimate children and those born of <lb/>
            concubines, are also accounted worthy. The one, therefore, <lb/>
            resemble those laws which are natural, and the other those <lb/>
            which derive their origin from human enactment.</p>
          <p>XVII. I also admire Leah, that woman endued with all <lb/>
            virtue, who, at the birth of Asher, who is the symbol of that <lb/>
            bastard wealth, which is perceptible by the outward senses, <lb/>
            says, " Blessed am I, because all women shall call me happy." * <lb/>
            For she sees plainly that sire will have a favourable reputation, <lb/>
            thinking that she deserves to be praised, not only by those <lb/>
            reasonings which are really masculine and manly, which have <lb/>
            a nature free from all spot and stain, and which honour that <lb/>
            which is really honest and incorrupt, but also by those more <lb/>
            feminine reasonings which are in every respect overcome by <lb/>
            those things which are visible, and which are unable to com­ <lb/>
            prehend any object of contemplation which is beyond them. <lb/>
            But it is the part of a perfect soul to set up a claim, not only <lb/>
            to be, but also to appear to be, and, to labour earnestly not <lb/>
            merely to have a good reputation in the houses of the men, but <lb/>
            also in the secret chambers of the women.</p>
          <p>On which account Moses also committed the preparation of <lb/>
            the sacred works of the tabernacle not only to men, but also to <lb/>
            women, who were to aid in making them ; for all “ the woven <lb/>
            works of hyacinthine colour, and of purple and of scarlet work, <lb/>
            and of fine linen, and of goats'hair, do the women make;" <lb/>
            and they also contribute their own ornaments without hesi­ <lb/>
            tation, “ seals, and ear-rings, and finger-rings, and armlets, and <lb/>
            tablets, all jewels of gold,”†—everything, in short, of which <lb/>
            gold was the material, gladly giving up the ornaments of their <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xxx. 13. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Exodus XXXV. 22. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="65"/>
            person in exchange for piety; and, moreover, carrying their <lb/>
            zeal to a still higher degree, they likewise consecrated even <lb/>
            their mirrors, that a laver might be made of them,”* in order <lb/>
            that those who were about to assist at the sacrifices, washing <lb/>
            their hands and their feet, that is to say, those works about <lb/>
            which the mind is occupied and on which it is fixed, may have <lb/>
            a view of themselves in a mirror according to the recollection <lb/>
            of those mirrors of which the laver was made ; for in this way <lb/>
            they will never permit anything disgraceful to remain in any <lb/>
            portion of the soul. And now they will dedicate the offering of <lb/>
            fasting and patience, the most beautiful and sacred, and perfect <lb/>
            of offerings.</p>
          <p>But these real citizens and virtuous women are really as if. <lb/>
            were the outward senses, by whom Leah, that is virtue, desires <lb/>
            to be honoured. But they who kindle an additional fire <lb/>
            against the miserable mind are destitute of any city. For we <lb/>
            read in the scripture that even, " women still burnt additional <lb/>
            fire to Moab.”† But may we not in this way say that so each <lb/>
            of the outward senses of the foolish man when set on fire by <lb/>
            the appropriate objects of outward sense, does also set fire to <lb/>
            the mind, spreading over it an exceeding and interminable <lb/>
            flame with irresistible vigour and impetuosity. At all events <lb/>
            it is best to propitiate the array of women, that is to say, <lb/>
            of the outward senses in the soul, just as it is desirable to do <lb/>
            so with respect to the men, that is to say, with respect to the <lb/>
            particular reasonings. For in this manner we shall arrange a <lb/>
            more excellent system of life in a very beautiful manner.</p>
          <p>XVIII. On this account also the self-instructed Isaac prays <lb/>
            to the lover of wisdom, that he may be able to comprehend <lb/>
            both those good things which are perceptible by the outward <lb/>
            senses, and those which are appreciable only by the intellect. <lb/>
            For he says, " May God give thee of the dew of heaven, and of <lb/>
            the fatness of the earth,”‡ a prayer equivalent, to May he in the <lb/>
            first place pour upon thee a continual and heavenly rain appre­ <lb/>
            ciable by the intellect, not violently so as to wash thee away, <lb/>
            but mildly and gently like dew, so as to benefit thee. And in <lb/>
            the second place, may he bestow upon thee that earthly wealth <lb/>
            which is perceptible by the outward senses, fat and fertile, <lb/>
            having drained off its opposite, namely poverty, from the soul <lb/>
            and from all its parts. <note type="footnote"> * Exodus XXXVIII. 8. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Numbers xxi. SO. </note> <note type="footnote"> ‡ Genesis xxvii. 28 </note> <note type="footnote"> VOL. II. </note> <note type="footnote"> G </note> <pb n="66"/>
            </p>
          <p>But if you examine the great high priest, that is to say <lb/>
            reason, you will find him entertaining ideas in harmony with <lb/>
            these, and having his sacred garments richly embroidered by <lb/>
            all the powers which are comprehensible either by the outward <lb/>
            senses or by the intellect; the other portion of which clothing <lb/>
            would require a more prolix explanation than is practicable <lb/>
            on the present occasion, and we must pass it by for the <lb/>
            present. But the extreme portions, those namely at the <lb/>
            head and at the feet, we will examine,</p>
          <p>There is then on the head "a golden leaf,”* pure, having <lb/>
            on it the impression of a seal, " Holiness to the Lord." <lb/>
            And on the feet there are, " on the fringe of the inner garment, <lb/>
            bells and small flowerets.”† But this seal is an idea of ideas, <lb/>
            according to which God fashioned the world, being an incor­ <lb/>
            poreal idea, comprehensible only by the intellect. And the <lb/>
            flowerets and the bells are symbols of distinctive qualities <lb/>
            perceptible by the outward senses; of which the facul­ <lb/>
            ties of hearing and of seeing are the judges. And he <lb/>
            adds, with exceeding accuracy of investigation, " The voice of <lb/>
            him shall be heard as he enters into the holy place," in order <lb/>
            that when the soul enters into the places appreciable by theintel­ <lb/>
            lect, and divine, and truly holy, the very outward senses may <lb/>
            likewise be benefited, and may sound in unison, in accordance <lb/>
            with virtue ; and our whole system, like a melodious chorus of <lb/>
            many men, may sing in concert one well-harmonised melody <lb/>
            composed of different sounds well combined, the thoughts in­ <lb/>
            spiring the leading notes (for the objects of intellect are the <lb/>
            leaders of the chorus) ; and the objects of the external senses, <lb/>
            singing in melodies, accord the symphonies which follow, which <lb/>
            are compared to individual members of the chorus.</p>
          <p>For, in short, as the law says, it was not right for the soul <lb/>
            to be deprived of " its necessaries, and its garments, and its <lb/>
            place of abode,”‡ these three things; but it ought rather to <lb/>
            have had each of them allotted to it in a durable manner. <lb/>
            Now the necessaries of the soul are those good things which <lb/>
            are perceptible only by the intellect, which ought, and indeed <lb/>
            are bound by the law of nature, to be attached to it; and the <lb/>
            clothing means those things which relate to the exterior and <lb/>
            visible ornament of human life ; and the place of abode is <lb/>
            continued diligence and care respecting each of the species <note type="footnote"> * Exodus xxviii. 36. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Exodus xxviii. 34. </note> <note type="footnote"> ‡ Exodus xxi. 10. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="67"/>
            before mentioned, in order that the objects of the outward <lb/>
            senses may appear as the invisible objects of the intellect do <lb/>
            also.</p>
          <p>XIX. There is, also, a fifth gift, which consists only in the. <lb/>
            bare fact of existence; and it is mentioned after all the pre­ <lb/>
            vious ones, not because it is inferior to them, but rather because <lb/>
            it overtops and excels them all; for what can be a greater <lb/>
            blessing than to be formed by nature, and to be, without any <lb/>
            falsehood or fictitious pretence, really good and worthy of the <lb/>
            most perfect praise ? " For," says God, " thou shalt be <lb/>
            blessed”* (<foreign xml:lang="grc">εὐλογητὸς</foreign>); not merely a person who is blessed <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">νος</foreign>),for this latter fact is estimated by the opinions <lb/>
            and report of the multitude, but the other depends on a person <lb/>
            being, in real truth, deserving of blessings; for as the being <lb/>
            praiseworthy (<foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸ ἐπαινετὸν εἶναι</foreign>) differs from being praised, being <lb/>
            superior to it; and as the being blameworthy differs from being <lb/>
            blamed, in being worse; for the one depends upon a person's <lb/>
            natural character, while the other is affirmed only with refer­ <lb/>
            ence to his being considered such and such. And real genuine <lb/>
            nature is a more reliable thing than opinion ; so, also, to be <lb/>
            blessed by men, that is to say, to be celebrated by their praises <lb/>
            and benedictions, is of less value than to be formed by nature <lb/>
            so as to be worthy of blessing, even though all men should be <lb/>
            silent respecting one, and this last is what is meant in the <lb/>
            scriptures by the term blessed (<foreign xml:lang="grc">εὐλογητὸς</foreign>).</p>
          <p>XX. These are the good things which are given to him who <lb/>
            is about to be wise. But let us now examine what God, for <lb/>
            the sake of the wise man, bestows on the rest of mankind also. <lb/>
            He says, " I will bless those who bless thee, and curse those <lb/>
            who curse thee."t Now that this is said by way of doing <lb/>
            honour to the good man, is plain to every one. And this, too, <lb/>
            is not the only reason why it is said, but it is said also on <lb/>
            account of the harmonious consequence which exists in things ; <lb/>
            for he who praises a good man is himself worthy of encomium, <lb/>
            and he who blames him is, on the other hand, deserving of <lb/>
            blame. But it is not so much the power of those who utter or <lb/>
            who write praise or blame that is trusted to, as the real character <lb/>
            of what is due ; so that those persons would not really appear <lb/>
            to praise or to blame at all who, in either case, adopt or intro­ <lb/>
            duce any falsehood of their own. Do you not see flatterers who, <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xiL 2. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Genesis xii 3. </note> <note type="footnote"> F 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="68"/>
            day and night, weary and annoy the ears of those to whom <lb/>
            they address their flatteries, and who not only nod assent to <lb/>
            every word that they say, but who also string together long <lb/>
            sentences, and connect rhapsodies, and often pray to them with <lb/>
            their mouths, but who are continually cursing them in their <lb/>
            hearts ? What, then, would any one in his senses say? Would <lb/>
            he not pronounce that those who speak thus are, in reality, <lb/>
            enemies rather than friends, and do in reality blame them <lb/>
            rather than praise them, even if they put together whole dramas <lb/>
            full of panegyric and sing them in their honour ?</p>
          <p>Therefore, the vain Balaam, although he sang hymns of <lb/>
            exceeding sublimity to God, among which, also, is that one <lb/>
            beginning, " God is not as a man,”* the most beautiful of all <lb/>
            songs, and who uttered panegyrics on the seeing multitude, <lb/>
            Israel, going through a countless body of particulars, is rightly <lb/>
            judged by the wise lawgiver to have been an impious man and <lb/>
            accursed, and to have been cursing rather than blessing; for <lb/>
            he says that he was hired for money by the enemy, and so be­ <lb/>
            came an evil prophet of evil things, bearing in his soul most <lb/>
            bitter curses against the God loving nature, but being com­ <lb/>
            pelled to utter prophetically with his mouth and tongue the <lb/>
            most exquisite and sublime prayers in their favour; for the <lb/>
            things that he said, being very excellent, were, in fact, suggested <lb/>
            by the God who loves virtue ; but the curses which he conceived <lb/>
            in his mind (for they were wicked) were the offspring of his <lb/>
            mind, which hated virtue.</p>
          <p>And the sacred scripture bears testimony to this fact; for it <lb/>
            says, " God did not grant to Balaam leave to curse thee, but <lb/>
            turned his curses into blessing;”† though, in fact, all the <lb/>
            words that he uttered were full of good omen. But he who <lb/>
            looks into all that is laid up in the recesses of the heart, and <lb/>
            who alone has the power to see those things which are invisible <lb/>
            to created beings, from these secret things has passed a con­ <lb/>
            demnatory decree, being in his own person at once the most <lb/>
            indubitable of witnesses and the most incorruptible of judges, <lb/>
            since even the contrary thing is praised, namely, for a man <lb/>
            who appears to calumniate and to accuse with his mouth, in <lb/>
            his heart to be blessing, and praising, and speaking words of <lb/>
            good omen. This, as it would seem, is the custom of those <lb/>
            who correct youth, and of preceptors, and of parents, and of <note type="footnote"> * Numbers xxiii. 19. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Deuteronomy XXIII. 5. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="69"/>
            elders, and of rulers, and of laws ; for they, at times, do each of <lb/>
            them reprove and punish, and by these means render the souls <lb/>
            of those who are under their instruction better. And of these <lb/>
            men no one is an enemy to his pupil, but they are all of them <lb/>
            friendly to all of them ; but it is the office of friends who have <lb/>
            a genuine and unalloyed good will to others to speak freely, <lb/>
            without any unfriendly purpose.</p>
          <p>Therefore, as far as blessings, and praises, and prayers, or, on <lb/>
            the other hand, reproaches and curses are concerned, one <lb/>
            must not so much be guided by what proceeds out of the mouth <lb/>
            by utterance, as by what is in the heart, by which, as by the <lb/>
            original source of them all, both kinds of speeches are esti­ <lb/>
            mated.</p>
          <p>XXI. These, then, are the things which, he says, happen in <lb/>
            the first instance to others on account of the good man, when <lb/>
            they seek to load him with either praise or blame, or with <lb/>
            blessings or curses. But that which comes next in order is the <lb/>
            most important thing; that when they are silent, still no <lb/>
            portion of the rational nature is left without a participation in <lb/>
            the benefits ; for God says that, " In thee shall all the nations <lb/>
            of the world be blessed." And this is a promise exceedingly full <lb/>
            of doctrine; for if the mind is always free from disease and <lb/>
            from injury, it then exerts all the tribes of feelings which <lb/>
            affect it, and all its powers in a state of sound health, namely, <lb/>
            its powers of seeing and of hearing, and all those which belong <lb/>
            to the outward senses ; and, moreover, all its appetites which <lb/>
            are conversant about pleasures and desires, and all those feel­ <lb/>
            ings likewise which being reduced from a state of agitation to <lb/>
            one of tranquillity, receive a better character from the change.</p>
          <p>Before now, indeed, cities, and countries, and peoples, and <lb/>
            nations of the earth, have enjoyed the greatest happiness and <lb/>
            prosperity in consequence of the virtue and prudence of the <lb/>
            individual; especially so when, in addition to a good disposition <lb/>
            and wisdom, God has also given him irresistible power, as he <lb/>
            may have given to a musician or to any artist the proper <lb/>
            instruments for music, or for carrying out any other art, or as <lb/>
            wood is supplied as a material for fire ; for in good truth the <lb/>
            just man is the prop of all the human race; and he, bringing all <lb/>
            that he has into the common stock for the advantage of these <lb/>
            who can use it, bestows his treasures ungrudgingly, and what­ <lb/>
             <pb n="70"/>
            ever he finds that he has not got in himself, he prays for to the <lb/>
            only giver of all wealth, the all-bounteous God.</p>
          <p>And God, opening the treasures of heaven, pours forth and <lb/>
            showers down upon him all kinds of good things together ; so <lb/>
            that all the channels on earth are filled with them to over­ <lb/>
            flowing. And these blessings he at all times freely bestows, <lb/>
            never rejecting the prayer of supplication which is addressed <lb/>
            to him ; for it is said in another passage, when Moses ad­ <lb/>
            dresses him with supplication : “ I am favourable to them <lb/>
            according to thy word."* And this expression, as it seems, <lb/>
            is equivalent to the other: "In thee all the nations of the <lb/>
            earth shall be blessed." On which account also the wise <lb/>
            Abraham, who had had experience of the goodness of God in <lb/>
            all things, believes that even if all other things are destroyed, <lb/>
            still a small fragment of virtue would be preserved, like a spark <lb/>
            of fire, and that for the sake of this little spark, he pities those <lb/>
            other things also, so as to raise them up when fallen, and re­ <lb/>
            kindle them when extinct.</p>
          <p>For even the slightest spark of fire that is still smouldering, <lb/>
            when it is fanned and re-kindled will set fire to a large pile : <lb/>
            and so too the smallest spark of virtue, when it beams up, being <lb/>
            wakened into life by good hopes, gives light to what has previously <lb/>
            been dim-sighted and blind, and causes what has been withered <lb/>
            to shoot up again, and whatever is barren and unproductive it <lb/>
            transforms and brings to abundance of prolific power. Thus a <lb/>
            good, which is but rare, is, by the kindness of God, made <lb/>
            abundant and showered upon men, making everything else to <lb/>
            resemble itself.</p>
          <p>XXII. Let us therefore pray that the mind may be in the <lb/>
            soul like a pillar in a house, and, in like manner, that the <lb/>
            just man may be firmly established in the human race for the <lb/>
            relief of all diseases; for while he is in vigorous health, one <lb/>
            must not abandon all hope of complete safety, as through the <lb/>
            medium of him, I imagine God the Saviour extending his all­ <lb/>
            healing medicine, that is to say, his propitious and merciful <lb/>
            power to his suppliants and worshippers, bids them employ it <lb/>
            for the salvation of those who are sick; spreading it like a <lb/>
            salve over the wounds of the soul, which folly, and injustice, <lb/>
            and all the other multitude of vices, being sharpened up, have <note type="footnote"> it Numbers xiv. 20. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="71"/>
            grievously inflicted upon it. And a most visible example of <lb/>
            this is the righteous Noah, who, when so many portions of the <lb/>
            soul were swallowed up in the great deluge, himself vigorously <lb/>
            overtopped the waves and floated on their surface, and so rose <lb/>
            above all the dangers which threatened him ; and when he <lb/>
            had escaped in safety, he sent out great and beautiful roots <lb/>
            from himself, from which, like a tree, the whole crop of <lb/>
            wisdom sprang up, which, bearing useful fruit, put forth the <lb/>
            three fruits of the seeing creature, Israel, the measures of <lb/>
            time, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.</p>
          <p>For, virtue is, and will be, and has been in everything; <lb/>
            which virtue perhaps is at times obscured among men by the <lb/>
            want of opportunity, but which opportunity the minister of <lb/>
            God again brings to light. Since Sarah, that is to say, pru­ <lb/>
            dence, brings forth a male child, flourishing, not according to <lb/>
            the periodical seasons of the year, but according to those <lb/>
            seasons and felicitous occasions which have no connection with <lb/>
            time; for it is said, " I will surely return and visit thee <lb/>
            according to the time of life; and Sarah, thy wife, shall have <lb/>
            a son."*</p>
          <p>XXIII. We have now, then, said enough about the gifts <lb/>
            which God is accustomed to bestow on those who are to <lb/>
            become perfect, and through the medium of them on others <lb/>
            also.</p>
          <p>In the next passage it is said, that "Abraham went as the <lb/>
            Lord commanded him.”† And this is the end which is cele­ <lb/>
            brated among those who study philosophy in the best manner, <lb/>
            namely, to live in accordance with nature. And this takes <lb/>
            place when the mind, entering into the path of virtue, treads <lb/>
            in the steps of right reason, and follows God, remembering <lb/>
            his commandments, and at all times and in all places confirm­ <lb/>
            ing them both by word and deed ;” for " he went as the Lord <lb/>
            commanded him." And the meaning of this is, as God com­ <lb/>
            mands (and he commands in a beautiful and praiseworthy <lb/>
            manner), in that very manner does the virtuous mail act, <lb/>
            guiding the path of his life in a blameless way, so that the <lb/>
            actions of the wise man are in no respect different from the <lb/>
            divine commands. At all events, God is represented in <lb/>
            another passage as saying, " Abraham has kept all my law." ‡+ <lb/>
            And law is nothing else but the word of God, enjoining what <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xviii. 10. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Genesis xii. 4. </note> <note type="footnote"> ‡ Genesis xxvi. 5. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="72"/>
            is right, and forbidding what is not right, as he bears witness, <lb/>
            where he says, " He received the law from his words."*</p>
          <p>If, then, the divine word is the law, and if the righteous <lb/>
            man does the law, then by all means he also performs the <lb/>
            the word of God. So that, as I said before, the words of God <lb/>
            are the actions of the wise mau. Accordingly, the end is <lb/>
            according to the most holy Moses, to follow God ; as he says <lb/>
            also in another passage, “ Thou shalt walk after the Lord thy <lb/>
            God ; "t not meaning that he should employ the motion of his <lb/>
            legs; for the earth is the support of a man, but whether the <lb/>
            whole world is sufficient to be the support of God, I do not <lb/>
            know; but he seems here to be speaking allegorically, intend­ <lb/>
            ing to represent the way in which the soul follows the divine <lb/>
            doctrines, which has a direct reference to the honour due to the <lb/>
            great cause of all things.</p>
          <p>XXIV. And he also, with a wish further to excite an irre­ <lb/>
            sistible desire of what is good, enjoins one to cleave to it; <lb/>
            for he says, " Thou shalt fear the Lord thy God, and him only <lb/>
            shalt thou serve ; aud thou shalt cleave to him."‡ What, then, <lb/>
            is this cleaving? What? Surely it is piety and faith; for <lb/>
            these virtues adapt and invite the mind to incorruptible nature. <lb/>
            For Abraham also, when he believed, is said to have “come <lb/>
            near to God.”§ If, therefore, while you are walking you are <lb/>
            neither fatigued, so as to give way and stumble, nor are so <lb/>
            careless as to turn to either the right hand or to the left hand, <lb/>
            and so to stray and miss the direct road which lies between the <lb/>
            two ; but if, imitating good runners, you finish the course of life <lb/>
            without stumbling or error, you will deservedly obtain the <lb/>
            crown and worthy prize of victory when you have arrived at <lb/>
            your desired end.</p>
          <p>For is not this the crown and the prize of victory not to miss <lb/>
            the proposed end of one's labours, but to arrive at that goal of <lb/>
            prudence which is so difficult to be reached? What, then, is <lb/>
            the object of having right wisdom? To be able to condemn <lb/>
            one's own folly and that of every created being. For to be <lb/>
            aware that one knows nothing is the eud of all knowledge, since <lb/>
            there is only one wise being, who is also the only God. On <lb/>
            which accouut Moses very beautifully has represented the <lb/>
            father of the universe as being also the inspector and superin­ <note type="footnote"> * Dent. xxxiii. 4. </note><note type="footnote"> ‡ Dent. x. 20. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Deut. xiii. 4. </note><note type="footnote"> § Genesis xviii. 23. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="73"/>
            tendent of all that he has created, saying, “ God saw all that <lb/>
            he had made, and behold it was very good."* For it was not <lb/>
            possible for any one to have an accurate view of all that had <lb/>
            been created, except for the Creator.</p>
          <p>Come, then, ye who are full of arrogance, and ignorance, and <lb/>
            of exceeding insolence, ye that are wise in your own conceit, <lb/>
            and who say not only that ye know accurately what each thing <lb/>
            is, but that you are also able to explain the causes why it is so, <lb/>
            showing daring with great rashness, as if ye had either been <lb/>
            present at the creation of the world, and had actually seen how <lb/>
            and from what each separate thing was made, or had been <lb/>
            counsellors of the Creator concerning the things which were <lb/>
            created. Come, and at once abandoning all other things, learn <lb/>
            to know yourselves, and tell us plainly what ye yourselves are in <lb/>
            respect of your bodies, in respect of your souls, in respect of <lb/>
            your external senses, and in respect of your reason.</p>
          <p>Tell us now with respect to one, and that the smallest, <lb/>
            perhaps, of the senses, what sight is, and how it is that you <lb/>
            see ; tell us what hearing is, and how is it that you hear ; tell <lb/>
            us what taste is, what touch is, what smell is, and how it is <lb/>
            that you exercise the energies of each of these faculties; and <lb/>
            what the sources of them are from which they originate. For <lb/>
            do not tell me long stories about the moon and the sun, and all <lb/>
            the other things in heaven and in the world, which are at such <lb/>
            a distance from us and which are so different in their natures, <lb/>
            empty-minded creatures that you are, before you examine into <lb/>
            and become acquainted with yourselves ; for when you have <lb/>
            learnt to understand yourselves, then perhaps one may believe <lb/>
            you when you enter into explanations respecting other things. <lb/>
            But till you are able to tell what you yourselves are, do not <lb/>
            expect ever to be looked upon as truth-telling judges or <lb/>
            witnesses with respect to others.</p>
          <p>XXV. Since, then, these things are in this state, the mind, <lb/>
            when it is rendered perfect, will pay its proper tribute to the <lb/>
            God who causes perfection, according to that most sacred scrip­ <lb/>
            ture, " For the law is, that tribute belongs to the Lord."† <lb/>
            When does the mind pay it ? When ? " On the third day it <lb/>
            comes to the place which God has told it of,”‡ having passed <lb/>
            by the greater portions of the differences of time, and being <lb/>
            now passing over to that nature which has no connection with <note type="footnote"> * Genesis L 31. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Numbers xxxi. 40. </note> <note type="footnote"> ‡ Genesis XXII.4. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="74"/>
            time ; for then it will sacrifice its beloved son, not a man (for <lb/>
            the wise man is not a slayer of his children), but the male off­ <lb/>
            spring of a virtuously living soul, the fruit which germinates <lb/>
            from it, as to which it knows not how it bore it,-the divine <lb/>
            shoot, which, when it appears, the soul then having appeared <lb/>
            to be pregnant, confesses that it does not understand the good <lb/>
            which has happened to it, saying, " Who will tell to <lb/>
            Abraham ?"* as if, in fact, he would refuse to believe about the <lb/>
            rising up of the self-taught race, that “ Sarah was suckling a <lb/>
            child," not that the child was being suckled by Sarah. For <lb/>
            the self-taught offspring is nourished by no one, but is itself <lb/>
            the nourishment of others as being competent to teach, and <lb/>
            having no need to learn ; for " I have brought forth a son, ” <lb/>
            not like the Egyptian women, in the flower of my age and in <lb/>
            the height of my bodily vigour, but like the Hebrew souls, " in <lb/>
            my old age,”† when all the objects of the outward senses and <lb/>
            all mortal things are faded, and when the objects of the intel­ <lb/>
            lect and immortal things are in their full vigour and worthy of <lb/>
            all estimation and honour.</p>
          <p>And I have brought forth, too, without requiring the aid of <lb/>
            the midwife's skill; for we bring forth even before any skill <lb/>
            or knowledge of man can come to us, without any of the ordi­ <lb/>
            nary means of assistance to help us, God having sown and <lb/>
            generated an excellent offspring, which, in accordance with the <lb/>
            law made concerning gratitude, very properly requites its <lb/>
            creator with gratitude and honour. For, says God, "My <lb/>
            gifts, and my offerings, and my first fruits, you have taken care <lb/>
            to bring to me.”‡</p>
          <p>XXVI. This is the end of the path of those who follow the <lb/>
            arguments and injunctions contained in the law, and who walk <lb/>
            in the way which God leads them in ; but he who falls short <lb/>
            of this, on account of his hunger after pleasure and his greedi­ <lb/>
            ness for the indulgence of his passions, by name Amalek; § <lb/>
            for the interpretation of the name Amalek is, " the people that <lb/>
            licks up " shall be cut off. And the sacred scriptures teach <lb/>
            us that this disposition is an insidious one; for when it per­ <lb/>
            ceives that the most vigorous portion of the power of the soul <lb/>
            has passed over, then, " rising up from its ambuscade, it cuts <lb/>
            to pieces the fatigued portion like a rearguard." <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xxi. 7. </note><note type="footnote"> ‡ Numbers xxviii. 2. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Exodus i. 18. </note><note type="footnote"> § Deuteronomy xxv. 17. </note> <pb n="75"/>
            </p>
          <p>And of fatigue there is one kind which easily succumbs <lb/>
            through the weakness of its reason which is unable to support <lb/>
            the labours, which are to be encountered in the cause of virtue, <lb/>
            and so, like those who are surprised in the rearguard, it is <lb/>
            easily overcome. But the other kind is willing to endure <lb/>
            honourable toil, vigorously persevering in all good things, and <lb/>
            not choosing to bear anything whatever that is bad, not even <lb/>
            though it be ever so trifling, but rejecting it as though it <lb/>
            were the heaviest of burdens.</p>
          <p>On which account, the law has also, by a very felicitous <lb/>
            appellation, called virtue Leah, which name, being interpreted, <lb/>
            means " wearied; " for she very naturally thought the life of <lb/>
            the wicked heavy and burdensome, and in its own nature <lb/>
            wearisome ; and did not choose even to look upon it, turning <lb/>
            her eyes only on what is beautiful; and let the mind labour <lb/>
            not only to follow God without any relaxation or want of <lb/>
            vigour, but also to walk onwards by the straight path, turning <lb/>
            to neither side, neither to the right nor yet to the left, as the <lb/>
            earthly Edom did, seeking out of the way lurking places, <lb/>
            at one time being full of excesses and superfluities, and at <lb/>
            another of differences and short comings; for it is better to <lb/>
            proceed along the middle road, which is that which is really <lb/>
            the royal road, and which the great and only King, God, has <lb/>
            widened to be a most suitable abode for the souls that love <lb/>
            virtue. On which account some also of those who prosecute <lb/>
            a gentle kind of philosophy, which is conversant chiefly about <lb/>
            the society of mankind, have pronounced the virtues to be <lb/>
            means, placing them on the confines between two extremes. <lb/>
            Since, on the one hand, excessive pride, being full of much <lb/>
            insolence is an evil, and to take up with a humble and self­ <lb/>
            abasing demeanour is to expose one's self to be trampled upon; <lb/>
            but the mean, which is compounded of both, in a gentle manner <lb/>
            is advantageous.</p>
          <p>XXVII. We must also inquire what the meaning of the <lb/>
            expression, " He went with Lot," * is. Now, the name Lot, <lb/>
            being interpreted, means " declination ;"and the mind declines <lb/>
            or inclines, at one time rejecting what is good, and at another <lb/>
            time what is evil. And both these declinations are often seen <lb/>
            in one and the same thing. For there are some hesitating <lb/>
            and wavering people who incline to both sides in turn, like a <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xiL 4. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="76"/>
            ship which is tossed about by different winds, or like the <lb/>
            different sides of a scale, being unable to rest firmly on one <lb/>
            thing; people whom one cannot praise even when they turn to <lb/>
            the better side, for they are influenced by impulse, and not by <lb/>
            deliberate meaning. Now, of these men Lot is a spectator, <lb/>
            who Moses here says went with the lover of wisdom. But it <lb/>
            was very well that when he began to accompany him he should <lb/>
            unlearn ignorance, and should never again return to it. But <lb/>
            still he goes with him, not in the hope of deriving improve­ <lb/>
            ment from an imitation of a better man, but with a view of <lb/>
            persecuting him also with a counter attraction and' allurements <lb/>
            in an opposite direction, and of leading him where there was a <lb/>
            chance of his falling.</p>
          <p>And a proof of this is, that the one, having fallen back again <lb/>
            into his ancient disease, departs, having been taken prisoner by <lb/>
            those enemies who are in the soul; but the other, having guarded <lb/>
            against all his designs, concealed in ambuscade, took every ima­ <lb/>
            ginable care to live at a distance from him. But the separate <lb/>
            habitation he will arrange hereafter, but not yet. For at pre­ <lb/>
            sent, his speculations, as would be likely to be the case with a <lb/>
            man who has but lately begun to apply himself to divine contem­ <lb/>
            plation, have a want of solidity and steadiness in them. But <lb/>
            when they have become more compact, and are established on a <lb/>
            firmer footing, then he will be able to separate from himself the <lb/>
            alluring and flattering disposition as an irreconcileable enemy, <lb/>
            and one difficult to subdue : for this is that disposition which <lb/>
            attaches itself to the soul in such a manner as to be difficult to <lb/>
            shake off, hindering it from proceeding swiftly on its progress <lb/>
            towards virtue.</p>
          <p>This, too, when we leave Egypt, that is to say, the whole of the <lb/>
            district connected with the body, being anxious to unlearn our <lb/>
            subjection to the passions, in accordance with the language and <lb/>
            precepts of the prephet Moses, follows us close, checking and <lb/>
            impeding our zeal in the departure, and out of envy causing <lb/>
            delay to the rapidity of setting forth ; for it is said, " And a <lb/>
            great mixed multitude went up with them, and sheep, and oxen, <lb/>
            and very much cattle.”* But this mixed multitude, if one <lb/>
            is to speak the plain truth, are the cattle-like and irrational <lb/>
            doctrines of the soul.</p>
          <p>XXVIII. And it is with particular beauty and propriety that <note type="footnote"> * Exodus xii. 38. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="77"/>
            he calls the soul of the wicked man a mixed multitude : for it <lb/>
            is truly a company which has been collected and brought toge­ <lb/>
            ther from all quarters, and composed of a promiscuous body of <lb/>
            numerous and antagonist opinions, being, though only one in <lb/>
            point of number, of infinite variety by reason of its versatility <lb/>
            and diversity; on which account, besides the word " mixed," <lb/>
            there is also added the epithet " great:" for he who looks at one <lb/>
            end only is truly simple, and unmixed, and plain; but he who <lb/>
            proposes to himself many objects of life is manifold, and mixed, <lb/>
            and rough, in real truth : on which account the sacred scrip­ <lb/>
            tures say, that that practiser of virtue, Jacob, was a smooth man, <lb/>
            and that Esau, the practiser of what is shameful, was a hairy or <lb/>
            rough man.</p>
          <p>On account, then, of this mixed and rough multitude collected <lb/>
            together from mixed opinions collected from all imaginable <lb/>
            quarters, the mind which was able to exert great speed when it <lb/>
            was fleeing from the country of the body, that is, from Egypt, <lb/>
            and which was able in those days to receive the inheritance of <lb/>
            virtue, being assisted by a threefold light, the memory of past <lb/>
            things, the energy of present things, and the hope of the future, <lb/>
            passed that exceeding length of time, forty years, in going up <lb/>
            and down, and all around, wandering in every direction by reason <lb/>
            of the diversity of manners, when it ought rather to have pro­ <lb/>
            ceeded by the straight and most advantageous way.</p>
          <p>This is he who not only rejoiced in a few species of desire, but <lb/>
            who also chose to pass by none whatever entirely, so that he <lb/>
            might obtain the whole entire genus in which every species is <lb/>
            included ; for it is said that, " the mixed multitude that was <lb/>
            among them desired all kinds of concupiscence,"* that is to say, <lb/>
            the very genus of concupiscence itself, and not some one species; <lb/>
            and sitting down they wept. For the mind is conscious that it <lb/>
            is possessed of but slight power, and when it is not able to ob­ <lb/>
            tain what it desires, it weeps and groans ; and yet it ought to <lb/>
            rejoice when it fails to be able to indulge its passions, or to be­ <lb/>
            come infected with diseases, and it ought to think their want and <lb/>
            absence a very great piece of good fortune. But it very often <lb/>
            happens to the followers of virtue, also, to become languid and <lb/>
            to weep, either because they are bewailing the calamities of <lb/>
            the foolish, on account of their participation in their common <note type="footnote"> * Numbers xi. 4. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="78"/>
            nature, and their natural love for their race, or through excess <lb/>
            of joy.</p>
          <p>And this excess of joy arises whenever on a sudden an abun­ <lb/>
            dance of all kinds of good coming together are showered down <lb/>
            to overflowing, without having been previously expected; in <lb/>
            reference to which kind of joy it is that the poet appears to me <lb/>
            to have used the expression- <lb/>
            Smiling amid her tears.*</p>
          <p>For exceeding joy, the best of all feelings, falling on <lb/>
            the soul when completely unexpected, makes it greater <lb/>
            than it was before, so that the body can no longer contain <lb/>
            it by reason of its bulk and magnitude ; and so, being <lb/>
            closely packed and pressed down, it distils drops which <lb/>
            it is the fashion to call tears, concerning which it is said in <lb/>
            the Psalms, " Thou shalt give me to eat bread steeped in <lb/>
            tears ;"t and again, " My tears have been my bread day and <lb/>
            night;" ‡ for the food of the mind are tears such as are visible, <lb/>
            proceeding from laughter seated internally and excited by <lb/>
            virtuous causes, when the divine desire instilled into our <lb/>
            hearts changes the song which was merely the lament of the <lb/>
            creature into the hymn of the uncreated God.</p>
          <p>XXIX. Some persons then repudiate this mixed and rough <lb/>
            multitude, and raise a wall of fortification to keep it from <lb/>
            them, rejoicing only in the race which loves God ; but some. on <lb/>
            the other hand, form associations with it, thinking it desirable <lb/>
            to arrange their own lives according to such a system that they <lb/>
            can place them on the confines between human and divine <lb/>
            virtues, in order that they may touch both those which are <lb/>
            virtues in truth and those which are such in appearance.</p>
          <p>Now the disposition which concerns itself in the affairs of <lb/>
            state adheres to this opinion, which disposition it is usual to <lb/>
            call Joseph, with whom. when he is about to bring his father, <lb/>
            there go up “ all the servants of Pharaoh, and the elders of <lb/>
            his house, and all the elders of the land of Egypt, and all the <lb/>
            whole family of Joseph, himself, and his brothers, and all his <lb/>
            father's house." § You see here that this disposition which is <lb/>
            conversant about affairs of state is placed between the house <lb/>
            of Pharaoh and his father's house, in order that it might <lb/>
            equally reach the affairs of the body, that is to say, of Egypt; <note type="footnote"> * Homer's Iliad, vi. 484. </note><note type="footnote"> ‡Psalm xlii. 3. </note> <note type="footnote"> † Psalm LXXX. 5. </note><note type="footnote"> § Genesis 1. 7. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="79"/>
            and those of the soul, which are all laid up in his father's <lb/>
            house as in a treasury ; for when he says, "1 am of God,”* <lb/>
            and all the other things which are akin to or connected with <lb/>
            him abide among the established laws of his father's house; <lb/>
            and when he mounts up into the second chariot of the mind, <lb/>
            which appears to bear sovereign sway, namely Pharaoh, he is <lb/>
            again establishing Egyptian pride. And he is more miserable <lb/>
            who is looked upon as a king of considerable renown, and who <lb/>
            is borne along in the chariot which has the precedence ; for to <lb/>
            be pre-eminent in what is not honourable is the most conspi­ <lb/>
            cuous disgrace, just as it is a lighter evil to come off second <lb/>
            best in such a contest.</p>
          <p>But you may learn to perceive how wavering a disposition <lb/>
            such a man has from the oaths which he swears, swearing at <lb/>
            one time “ by the health of Pharaoh,”† and then again, on the <lb/>
            contrary, "not by the health of Pharaoh." But this latter <lb/>
            formula of oath, which contains a negation, looks as if it were <lb/>
            the injunction of his father's house, which is always medi­ <lb/>
            tating the destruction of the passions, and wishing that they <lb/>
            should die; but the other brings us back to the discipline of <lb/>
            Egypt, which desires that these passions should be preserved ; <lb/>
            on which account, although so great a multitude went up <lb/>
            together, he still does not call it a mixed multitude, since to a <lb/>
            person who is endowed with a real power of seeing, and who <lb/>
            is a lover of virtue, every thing which is not virtue nor an <lb/>
            action of virtue, appears to be mixed and confused ; but to him <lb/>
            who still loves the things of earth, the prizes of earth do by <lb/>
            themselves seem to be worthy of love and worthy of honour.</p>
          <p>XXX. Accordingly, as I have already said. the lovers of <lb/>
            wisdom will raise a wall of exclusion against the man who. <lb/>
            like a drone, has resolved to injure his profitable labours, and <lb/>
            who follows him with this object, and he will receive those who, <lb/>
            out of their admiration of what is honourable, follow him <lb/>
            with a view to imitating him; assigning to each of them that <lb/>
            portion which is suited to them; for, says he, “ of the <lb/>
            men who went with me, Eschol, Anian, and Mamre shall <lb/>
            receive a share." ‡ And by these names of persons he means <lb/>
            dispositions which are good by nature and fond of contempla­ <lb/>
            tion ; for Eschol is an emblem of a good disposition, having a <lb/>
            name of fire, since a good disposition is full of good daring <note type="footnote"> * Genesis 1. 19. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Genesis xlii. 16. </note> <note type="footnote"> ‡ Genesis xiv. 24. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="80"/>
            and fervour, and adheres to what it has ever applied itself. <lb/>
            And Annan is the symbol of a man fond of contemplation ; <lb/>
            for the name, being interpreted, means " the eyes," from the <lb/>
            fact that the eyes of the soul also are opened by cheerfulness ; <lb/>
            and of both these persons a life of contemplation is the inhe­ <lb/>
            ritance, which is entitled Mamre, which name is derived from <lb/>
            seeing; and to the contemplative man, the faculty of seeing <lb/>
            is most appropriate and most peculiarly belonging.</p>
          <p>But when the mind, having been under the tuition of these <lb/>
            trainers, finds nothing wanting for practice, it then proceeds <lb/>
            onwards with and accompanies perfect wisdom, not outstrip­ <lb/>
            ping it nor being outstripped by it, but marching alongside of <lb/>
            it steo by step, with equal pace. And the words of scripture <lb/>
            show this, in which it is distinctly stated that “ they both of <lb/>
            them went together, and came to the plain which God had <lb/>
            mentioned to them:" a most excellent equality of virtues, <lb/>
            better than any rivalry, an equality of labour with a natural <lb/>
            good condition of body, and an equality of art with self- <lb/>
            instructed nature, so that both of them are able to carry off <lb/>
            equal prizes of virtue ; as if the arts of painting and statuary were <lb/>
            not. only able, as they are at present, to make representations <lb/>
            devoid of motion or animation, but were able also to invest the <lb/>
            objects which they paint or form with motion and life ; for in <lb/>
            that case the arts which were previously imitative of the works <lb/>
            of nature would appear now to have become the natures them­ <lb/>
            selves.</p>
          <p>XXXI. But whoever is raised on high to such a sublime <lb/>
            elevation will never any more allow any of the portions of his <lb/>
            soul to dwell below among mortal men, but will draw them all <lb/>
            up to himself as if they were suspended by a rope ; for which <lb/>
            reason a sacred injunction of the following purport was given <lb/>
            to the wise man, “ Go thou up to thy Lord, thou, and Aaron, <lb/>
            and Nadab, and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel.”† <lb/>
            And the meaning of this injunction is as follows, " Go up, 0 <lb/>
            soul, to the view of the living God, in an orderly manner, <lb/>
            rationally, voluntarily, fearlessly, lovingly, in the holy and <lb/>
            perfect numbers of seven multiplied tenfold." For Aaron is <lb/>
            described in the law as the prophet of Moses, being loudly <lb/>
            uttered speech prophesying to the mind. And Nadab is inter­ <lb/>
            preted " voluntary.” that is to say, the man who honours the <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xxii. 3. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Exodus xxiv. 1. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="81"/>
            Deity without compulsion ; and the interpretation of the <lb/>
            name Abihu is, “ my father." This man is one who has not <lb/>
            need of a master by reason of his folly, more than of a father by <lb/>
            reason of his wisdom, namely such a father as God the ruler of <lb/>
            the world. And these powers are the body-guards of the mind <lb/>
            which is worthy to bear sovereign sway, which ought also to <lb/>
            attend upon the king, and conduct him on his way.</p>
          <p>But the soul is afraid by itself to rise up to the contempla­ <lb/>
            tion of the living God, if it does not know the road, from being <lb/>
            lifted up by a union of ignorance and audacity; and the falls <lb/>
            which are caused by such a union of ignorance and great <lb/>
            rashness are very serious ; on which account Moses prays that <lb/>
            he may have God himself as his guide to the road which leads <lb/>
            to him. For he says, " If thou wilt not thyself go with me, <lb/>
            then do not thou lead me hence.”* Because every motion <lb/>
            which is without the divine approbation is mischievous, and it <lb/>
            is better for men to remain here wandering about in this mortal <lb/>
            life, as the greater portion of the human race does, than raising <lb/>
            themselves up to heaven in pride and arrogance, to encounter <lb/>
            an overthrow, as has happened to countless numbers of <lb/>
            sophists, who have looked upon wisdom as only a discovery of <lb/>
            plausible arguments, and not, as it is, a certain belief in and <lb/>
            well-assured knowledge of facts. And perhaps too there is <lb/>
            some such meaning as this intended to be conveyed by these <lb/>
            words,-do not raise me up on high, bestowing on me riches, or <lb/>
            glory, or honours, or authority, or any other of those things <lb/>
            which are usually ranked as good, unless you intend also to go <lb/>
            with them and me yourself; for these things are o ten cal­ <lb/>
            culated to cause either great mischief, or great advantage to <lb/>
            their possessors ; advantage when God is the guide of their <lb/>
            mind ; injury when the contrary is the case. For to great <lb/>
            numbers of people the things which are called good not being <lb/>
            so in reality have been the causes of irremediable evils, but <lb/>
            the man who follows God does of necessity have for his fellow <lb/>
            travellers all those reasons which are the attendants of God, <lb/>
            which we are accustomed to call angels.</p>
          <p>At all events, it is said that "Abraham went with them <lb/>
            conducting them on their way.”† Oh the admirable praise! <lb/>
            according to which, he who was conducting others was himself <lb/>
            conducted by them, only giving what he was receiving; not <note type="footnote"> Exodus xxxiii. 15. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Genesis xviii. 16. </note> <note type="footnote"> VOL. II. </note> <note type="footnote"> G </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="82"/>
            giving one thing instead of another, but only that one single <lb/>
            thing, w.iich was prepared as a retributory gift, for until a man <lb/>
            is made perfect he uses divine reason as the guide of his path. <lb/>
            for that is the sacred oracle of scripture : “ Behold, I send my <lb/>
            angel before thy face that he may keep thee in the road, so as <lb/>
            to lead thee into the land which I have prepared for thee. <lb/>
            Attend thou to him, and listen to him ; do not disobey him ; for <lb/>
            he will not pardon your transgressions, for my name is in <lb/>
            him.”* But when he has arrived at the height of perfect <lb/>
            knowledge, then, running forward vigorously, he keeps up with <lb/>
            the speed of him who was previously leading him in his way; <lb/>
            for in this way they will both become attendants of God who <lb/>
            is the guide of all things ; no one of those who hold erroneous <lb/>
            opinions accompanying them any longer, and even Lot himself, <lb/>
            who turned on one side the soul, which might have been <lb/>
            upright and inflexible, removing and living at a distance.</p>
          <p>XXXII. And “Abraham,” says Moses, "was seventy-five <lb/>
            years of age, when lie departed out of Charran.” Now con­ <lb/>
            cerning the number of seventy-five years (for this contains a <lb/>
            calculation corresponding to what has been previously ad. <lb/>
            vanced.) we will enter into an accurate examination hereafter. <lb/>
            But first of all we will examine what Charran is, and what is <lb/>
            meant by the departure from this country to go and live <lb/>
            in another. Now it is not probable that any one of those persons <lb/>
            who are acquainted with the law are ignorant that Abraham <lb/>
            had previously migrated from Chaldæa when he came to live <lb/>
            in Charran. But after his father died he then departed from <lb/>
            this land of Chaldæa, so that he had now migrated from two <lb/>
            different places. What then shall we say?</p>
          <p>The Chaldeans appear beyond all other men to have devoted <lb/>
            themselves to the study of astronomy and of genealogies; <lb/>
            adapting things on earth to things sublime, and also adapting <lb/>
            the things of heaven to those on earth, and like people who, <lb/>
            availing themselves of the principles of music, exhibit a most <lb/>
            perfect symphony as existing in the universe by the common <lb/>
            union and sympathy of the parts for one another, which though <lb/>
            separated as to place, are not disunited in regard of kindred. <lb/>
            These men, then, imagined that this world which we behold <lb/>
            was the only world in the existing universe, and was either <lb/>
            God himself, or else that it contained within itself God, that <note type="footnote"> ∗ Exodus xxiii. 20. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="83"/>
            is, the soul of the universe. Then, having erected fate and <lb/>
            necessity into gods, they filled human life with excessive impiety, <lb/>
            teaching men that with the exception of those things which <lb/>
            are apparent there is no other cause whatever of anything, but <lb/>
            that it is the periodical revolutions of the sun, and moon, and <lb/>
            other stars, which distribute good and evil to all existing <lb/>
            beings.</p>
          <p>Moses indeed appears to have in some degree subscribed to <lb/>
            the doctrine of the common union and sympathy existing <lb/>
            between the parts of the universe, as he has said that the world <lb/>
            was one and created (for as it is a created thing and also one, <lb/>
            it is reasonable to suppose that the same elementary essences are <lb/>
            laid as the foundations of all the particular effects which arise, <lb/>
            as happens with respect to united bodies that they reciprocally <lb/>
            contain each other); but lie differs from them widely in their <lb/>
            opinion of God, not intimating that either the world itself, or <lb/>
            the soul of the world, is the original God, nor that the <lb/>
            stars or their motions are the primary causes of the events <lb/>
            which happen among men ; but he teaches that this universe <lb/>
            is held together by invisible powers, which the Creator has <lb/>
            spread from the extreme borders of the earth to heaven, making <lb/>
            a beautiful provision to prevent what he has joined together <lb/>
            from being dissolved ; for the indissoluble chains which bind <lb/>
            the universe are his powers.</p>
          <p>On which account even though it may be said somewhere in <lb/>
            the declaration of the law, " God is in the heaven above, and <lb/>
            in the earth beneath," let no one suppose that God is here <lb/>
            spoken of according to his essence. For the living God <lb/>
            contains everything, and it is impiety to suppose that he is <lb/>
            contained by any thing, but what is meant is, that his power <lb/>
            according to which he made, and arranged, and established the <lb/>
            universe, is both in heaven and earth. And this, to speak <lb/>
            correctly, is goodness, which has driven away from itself envy, <lb/>
            which hates virtue and detests what is good, and which <lb/>
            generates those virtues by which it has brought all existing <lb/>
            things into existence and exhibited them as they are.</p>
          <p>Since the living God is indeed conceived of in opinion <lb/>
            everywhere, but in real truth he is seen nowhere ; so that <lb/>
            divine scripture is most completely true in which it is said, <lb/>
            " Here am I," speaking of him who cannot be shown as if he <lb/>
            were being shown, of “ him who is invisible as if he were <note type="footnote"> a 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="84"/>
            visible, before thou existedst." * For he proceeds onward before <lb/>
            the created universe, and outside of it, and not contained or <lb/>
            borne onward in any of the things whose existence began after <lb/>
            his.</p>
          <p>XXXIII. These things then having been now said for the <lb/>
            purpose of overturning the opinions of the Chaldeans ; he <lb/>
            thinks that it is desirable to lead off and invite away those <lb/>
            who are still Chaldaizing in their minds to the truth of his <lb/>
            teaching, and he begins thus :—</p>
          <p>" Why," says he, “ my excellent friends do you raise your­ <lb/>
            selves up in such a sudden manner from the earth, and soar to <lb/>
            such a height? and why do ye rise above the air, and tread the <lb/>
            ethereal expanse, investigating accurately the motions of the <lb/>
            sun, and the periodical revolutions of the moon, and the <lb/>
            harmonious and much-renowned paths of the rest of the stars? <lb/>
            for these things are too great for your comprehension, inasmuch <lb/>
            as they have received a more blessed and divine position. <lb/>
            Descend therefore from heaven, and when you have come down, <lb/>
            do not, on the other hand, employ yourselves in the investigation <lb/>
            of the earth and the sea, and the rivers, and the natures of <lb/>
            plants and animals, but rather seek to become acquainted with <lb/>
            yourselves and your own nature, and do not prefer to dwell <lb/>
            anywhere else, rather than in yourselves. For by contemplating <lb/>
            the things which are to be seen in your own dwelling, that <lb/>
            which bears the mastery therein, and that which is in subjection; <lb/>
            that which has life, and that which is inanimate ; that which is <lb/>
            endowed with and that which is destitute of reason ; that which <lb/>
            is immortal, and that which is mortal; that which is better, <lb/>
            and that which is worse ; you will at once arrive at a correct <lb/>
            Knowledge of God and of his works. For you will perceive <lb/>
            that there is a mind in you and in the universe ; and that your <lb/>
            mind, having asserted its authority and power over all the things <lb/>
            in you, has brought each of the parts into subjection to himself. <lb/>
            In like manner also, the mind of the universe being invested <lb/>
            with the supremacy, governs the world by independent law and <lb/>
            justice, having a providential regard not only for those things <lb/>
            which are of more importance, but also for those which appear <lb/>
            to be somewhat obscure.</p>
          <p>XXXIV. Abandoning therefore your superfluous anxiety to <note type="footnote"> * Exodus xvii. 6. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="85"/>
            investigate the things of heaven, dwell, as I said just now <lb/>
            within yourselves, forsaking the land of the Chaldeans, that is, <lb/>
            opinion, and migrating to Charran the region of the outward <lb/>
            sense, which is the corporeal abode of the mind. For the name <lb/>
            Charran, being interpreted, means "a hole ;” and holes are the <lb/>
            emblems of the places of the outward sense. For in some <lb/>
            sense they are all holes and caves, the eyes being the caves <lb/>
            in which the sight dwells, the ears those of hearing, the nostrils <lb/>
            those of smelling, the throat the cavern of taste, and the whole <lb/>
            frame of the body, being the abode of touch. Do ye therefore, <lb/>
            dwelling among these things, remain tranquil and quiet, and <lb/>
            investigate with all the exactness in your power the nature of <lb/>
            each, and when you have learnt what there is good and bad in <lb/>
            each part, avoid the one and choose the other.</p>
          <p>And when you have thoroughly and perfectly considered the <lb/>
            whole of your own habitation, and have understood what rela­ <lb/>
            tive importance each of its parts possesses, then rouse your­ <lb/>
            selves up and seek to accomplish a migration from hence, <lb/>
            which shall announce to you, not death, but immortality; the <lb/>
            evident proofs of which you will see even while involved in <lb/>
            the corporeal cares perceptible by the outward senses, some­ <lb/>
            times while in deep slumber (for then the mind, roaming <lb/>
            abroad, and straying beyond the confines of the outward <lb/>
            senses, and of all the other affections of the body, begins to <lb/>
            associate with itself, looking on truth as at a mirror, and dis­ <lb/>
            carding all the imaginations which it had contracted from the <lb/>
            outward senses, becomes inspired by the truest divination <lb/>
            respecting the future, through the instrumentality of dreams), <lb/>
            and at other times in your waking moments. For when, <lb/>
            being under the influence of some philosophical speculations, <lb/>
            you are allured onwards, then the mind follows this, and for­ <lb/>
            gets all the other things which concern its corporeal abode; <lb/>
            and if the external senses prevent it from arriving at an accu­ <lb/>
            rate sight of the objects of the intellect, then those who are <lb/>
            fond of contemplation take care to diminish the impetuosity <lb/>
            of its attack, for they close their eyes and stop up their ears, <lb/>
            and check the rapid motion of the other organ, and choose to <lb/>
            abide in tranquillity and darkness, that the eye of the soul, to <lb/>
            which God has granted the power of understanding the objects <lb/>
            of the intellect, may never be overshadowed by any of those <lb/>
            objects appreciable only by the outward senses.</p><pb n="86"/>
            
          <p>XXXV. Having then in this manner learnt to accomplish <lb/>
            the abandonment of mortal things, you shall become instructed <lb/>
            in the proper doctrines respecting the uncreated God, unless <lb/>
            indeed you think that our mind, when it has put off the body, <lb/>
            the external senses, and reason, can, when destitute of all <lb/>
            these things and naked, perceive existing things, and that the <lb/>
            mind of the universe, that is to say, God, does not dwell out­ <lb/>
            side of all material nature, and that he contains everything <lb/>
            and is not contained by anything; and further, he does not pe­ <lb/>
            netrate beyond things by his intellect alone, like a man, but <lb/>
            also by his essential nature, as is natural for a God to do ; for <lb/>
            it is not our mind which made the body. but that is the work <lb/>
            bf something else, on which account it is contained in the body <lb/>
            as in a vessel; but the mind of the universe created the uni­ <lb/>
            verse, and the Creator is better than the created, therefore it <lb/>
            can never be contained in what is inferior to itself: besides <lb/>
            that it is not suitable for the father to be contained in the <lb/>
            son, but rather for the son to derive increase from the love of <lb/>
            the father.</p>
          <p>And in this manner the mind, migrating for a short time, <lb/>
            will come to the father of piety and holiness, removing at first to <lb/>
            a distance from genealogical science, which originally did <lb/>
            erroneously persuade it to fancy that the world was the primary <lb/>
            god, and not the creature of the first God, and that the motions <lb/>
            and agitations of the stars were the causes to men of disaster, <lb/>
            or, on the contrary, of good fortune. After that the mind, <lb/>
            coming to a due consideration of itself, and studying philo­ <lb/>
            sophically the things affecting its own abode, that is the things <lb/>
            of the body. the things of the outward sense, the things of reason, <lb/>
            and knowing, as the line in the poet has it- <lb/>
            That in those halls both good and ill are planned ;* <lb/>
            Then, opening the road for itself, and hoping by travelling along <lb/>
            it to arrive at a notion of the father of the universe, so difficult <lb/>
            to be understood by any guesses or conjectures, when it has <lb/>
            come to understand itself accurately, it will very likely be able <lb/>
            to comprehend the nature of God; no longer remaining in <lb/>
            Charran, that is in the organs of outward sense,but returning <lb/>
            to itself. For it is impossible, while it is still in a state of <lb/>
            motion, in a manner appreciable by the outward sense rather <note type="footnote"> * Homer. Odyssey, iv. 392. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="87"/>
            than by the intellect, to arrive at a proper consideration of the <lb/>
            living God.</p>
          <p>XXXVI. On which account also that disposition which is <lb/>
            ranked in the highest class by God, by name Samuel, does not <lb/>
            explain the just precepts of kingly power to Saul, while he is <lb/>
            still lying among the pots, but only after he has drawn him <lb/>
            out from thence : for he inquires whether the mail is still <lb/>
            coming hither, and the sacred oracle answers, " Behold, he is <lb/>
            hidden among the stuff."* What, then, ought he who hears <lb/>
            this answer, and who is by nature inclined to receive instruc­ <lb/>
            tion, to do, but to draw him out at once from thence ? <lb/>
            Accordingly, we are told, " He ran up and took him out from <lb/>
            thence, because he who was abiding among the vessels of the <lb/>
            soul, that is, the body and the outward senses, was not worthy <lb/>
            to bear the doctrines and laws of the kingdom (and by the <lb/>
            kingdom, we mean wisdom, since we call the wise man a king); <lb/>
            but when he has risen up and changed his place, then the <lb/>
            mist around him is dissipated, and he will be able to see clearly.</p>
          <p>Very appropriately, therefore, does the companion of know­ <lb/>
            ledge think it right to leave the region of the outward sense, <lb/>
            by name Charran ; and he leaves it when he is seventy-five <lb/>
            years old ; and this number is on the confines of the nature <lb/>
            discernible by the outward senses, and of that intelligible by the <lb/>
            intellect, and of the older and younger, and also of perishable <lb/>
            and imperishable nature ; for the elder, the imperishable <lb/>
            ratio, that comprehensible by the intellect, exists in the <lb/>
            seventy ; the younger ratio, discernible by the outward senses, <lb/>
            is equal in number to the five outward senses. In this latter <lb/>
            also the practiser of virtue is seen exercising himself when Le <lb/>
            has not yet been able to carry off the perfect prize of victory;­ <lb/>
            for, it is said, that all the souls which came out of Jacob were <lb/>
            seventy and five ; †—for to him, while wrestling, and not <lb/>
            shrinking at all from the truly sacred contest, for the acqui­ <lb/>
            sition of virtue, belong the souls which are the offspring of <lb/>
            the body. and which have not yet acquired reason, but are still <lb/>
            attracted by the multitude of the outward senses.</p>
          <p>For Jacob is the name of one who is wrestling and engaged <lb/>
            in a contest and trying to trip up his antagonist, not of one who <lb/>
            has gained the victory. But when he appeared to have gained <lb/>
            ability to behold God, his name was changed to Israel, and <note type="footnote"> * 1 Samuel x. 22. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Genesis xlvi 27. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="88"/>
            then he uses only the computation of seventy, having extir­ <lb/>
            pated the number five, the number of the outward senses ; for <lb/>
            it is said, that “ thy fathers went down to Egypt, being seventy <lb/>
            souls."* This is the number which is familiar to Moses the <lb/>
            wise mail : for it happened that those who were selected as <lb/>
            carefully picked men out of the whole multitude, were seventy <lb/>
            in number; and those all elders, not only in point of age, but <lb/>
            also in wisdom and counsel, and in prudence, and in ancient <lb/>
            integrity of manners. And this number is consecrated and <lb/>
            dedicated to God when the perfect fruits of the soul are <lb/>
            offered up.</p>
          <p>For, on the feast of tabernacles, besides all other sacrifices, <lb/>
            it is ordered that the priest should offer up seventy heifers for <lb/>
            a burnt offering. Again, it is in accordance with the compu­ <lb/>
            tation of seventy that the phials of the princes are provided, <lb/>
            for each of them is of the weight of seventy shekels ; since <lb/>
            whatever things are associated and confederate together in the <lb/>
            soul, and dear to one another, have a power which is truly at­ <lb/>
            tractive, namely, the sacred computation of seventy, which <lb/>
            Egypt, the nature which hates virtue, and loves to indulge the <lb/>
            passions, is introduced as lamenting; for mourning among <lb/>
            them is computed at seventy days.t</p>
          <p>XXXVII. This number, therefore, as I have said before, is <lb/>
            familiar to Moses, but the number of the five outward senses is <lb/>
            familiar to him who embraces the body and external things, <lb/>
            which it is customary to call Joseph ; for he pays such attention <lb/>
            to those things, that he presents his own uterine brother,‡ the <lb/>
            offspring of the outward sense, for he had no acquaintance at all <lb/>
            with those who were only his brothers as sons of the same father, <lb/>
            with five exceedingly beautiful garments, thinking the outward <lb/>
            senses things of exceeding beauty, and worthy of being adorned <lb/>
            and honoured by him. Moreover, he also enacts laws for the <lb/>
            whole of Egypt, that they should honour them, and pay taxes <lb/>
            and tribute to them every year as to their kings; for he com­ <lb/>
            mands them to take a fifth § part of the corn, that is to say, to <lb/>
            store up in the treasury abundant materials and nourishment <lb/>
            for the five outward senses, in order that each of them might <lb/>
            rejoice while filling itself unrestrainedly with suitable food, and <lb/>
            that it might weigh down and overwhelm the mind with the <note type="footnote"> * Deuteronomy x. 22. </note><note type="footnote"> ‡ Genesis xlv. 22. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Genesis 1. 8. </note><note type="footnote"> § Genesis xlvii. 24. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="89"/>
            multitude of things which were thus brought upon it; for <lb/>
            during the banquet of the outer senses, the mind is labouring <lb/>
            under a famine, as, on the contrary, when the outward senses <lb/>
            are fasting, the mind is feasting.</p>
          <p>Do you not see that the five daughters of Salpaad, which <lb/>
            we, using allegorical expressions, call the outward senses, were <lb/>
            born of the tribe of Manasseh, who is the son of Joseph, the <lb/>
            elder son in point of time, but the younger in rank and power? <lb/>
            and very naturally, for he is so called from forgetfulness, which <lb/>
            is a thing of equal power with an outward sense. But recol­ <lb/>
            lection is placed in the second rank, after memory, of which <lb/>
            Ephraim is the namesake ; and the interpretation of the name <lb/>
            of Ephraim is, " bearing fruit;" and the most beautiful and nu­ <lb/>
            tritious fruit in souls is a memory which never forgets; there­ <lb/>
            fore the virgins speak to one another in a becoming manner, <lb/>
            saying, " Our father is dead." Now the death of recollection <lb/>
            is forgetfulness: " And he has died not for his own sin,"* <lb/>
            speaking very righteously, for forgetfulness is not a voluntary <lb/>
            affection, but is one of those things which are not actually in <lb/>
            us, but which come upon us from without. And they were not <lb/>
            his sons, but his daughters ; since the power of memory, as <lb/>
            being what has its existence by its own nature, is the parent <lb/>
            of male children; but forgetfulness, arising from the slumber <lb/>
            of reason, is the parent of female children, for it is destitute of <lb/>
            reason; and the outward senses are the daughters of the irra­ <lb/>
            tional part of the soul.</p>
          <p>But if any one has outrun him in speed, and has become a <lb/>
            follower of Moses, though he is not yet able to keep pace with <lb/>
            him, he will use a compound and mixed number, namely, that <lb/>
            of five and seventy, which is the symbol of the nature which is <lb/>
            both perceptible by the outward senses and intelligible by the <lb/>
            intellect, the two uniting together for the production of one <lb/>
            irreproachable species.</p>
          <p>XXXVIII. 1 very much admire Rebecca, who is patience, <lb/>
            because she, at that time, recommends the man who is perfect <lb/>
            in his soul, and who has destroyed the roughnesses of the <lb/>
            passions and vices, to flee and return to Charran ; for she says, <lb/>
            “ Now, therefore, my child, hear my voice, and rise up and <lb/>
            depart, and flee away to Laban, my brother, to Charran, and <lb/>
            dwell with him certain days, until the anger and rage of thy <note type="footnote"> * Numbers xxvii. 3. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="90"/>
            brother is turned from being against thee, and till he forgets <lb/>
            what thou hast done to him."* And it is with great beauty <lb/>
            that she here calls going by the road, which leads to the out­ <lb/>
            ward senses, a fleeing away ; for, in truth, the mind is then a <lb/>
            fugitive, when, having left its own appropriate objects which <lb/>
            are comprehensible to the understanding, it turns to the oppo­ <lb/>
            site rank of those which are perceptible by the outward senses. <lb/>
            And there are cases in which to run away is useful, when a <lb/>
            person adopts this line of conduct, not out of hatred to his supe­ <lb/>
            rior, but in order to avoid the snares which are laid for him by <lb/>
            his inferior.</p>
          <p>What, then, is the recommendation of patience '? A most <lb/>
            admirable and excellent one. If ever, she says, you see the <lb/>
            passion of rage and anger highly provoked and excited to fero­ <lb/>
            city either in thyself or in any one else, which is nourished by <lb/>
            irrational and unmanageable nature, do not excite it further and <lb/>
            make it more savage, for then perhaps it will inflict incurable <lb/>
            wounds ; but cool its fervour, and pacify its too highly inflamed <lb/>
            disposition, for if it be tamed and rendered tractable it will do <lb/>
            you less injury.</p>
          <p>What, then, are the means by which it can be tamed and <lb/>
            pacified ? Having, as far as appearance goes, assumed another <lb/>
            form and another character, follow it, first of all, wherever it <lb/>
            pleases, and, opposing it in nothing, admit that you have the <lb/>
            same objects of love and hatred with itself, for by these means <lb/>
            it will be rendered propitious ; and, when it is pacified, then <lb/>
            you may lay aside your pretence, and, not expecting any longer <lb/>
            to suffer any evil at its hand, you may with indifference return <lb/>
            to the care of your own objects ; for it is on this account that <lb/>
            Charran is represented as full of cattle, and as having tenders <lb/>
            of flocks for its inhabitants. For what region could be more <lb/>
            suitable for irrational nature, and for those who have undertaken <lb/>
            the care and superintendence of it, than the external senses <lb/>
            which exist in us ? Accordingly, when the practiser of virtue <lb/>
            asks, ,. From whence come ye?" the shepherds answer him <lb/>
            truly, that they come from Charran." t For the irrational <lb/>
            powers come from the external sense, as the rational ones <lb/>
            come from the mind. And when he further inquires whether <lb/>
            they know Laban, they very naturally assert that they do know <lb/>
            him, for the outward sense is acquainted with complexion and <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xxvii. 43. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Genesis xxix. 4. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="91"/>
            with every distinctive quality, as it thinks ; and of complexion <lb/>
            and distinctive qualities Laban is the symbol.</p>
          <p>And he himself, when at last he is made perfect, will quit <lb/>
            the abode of the outward senses, and will set up the abode of <lb/>
            the soul as belonging to the soul, which, while still among <lb/>
            labours and among the external senses, he gives a vivid descrip­ <lb/>
            tion of; for he says, " When shall I make myself, also, a <lb/>
            house ?" * When, disregarding the objects of the external senses <lb/>
            and the external senses themselves, shall I dwell in mind and <lb/>
            intellect, being, in name, going to and fro among and dwelling <lb/>
            among the objects of contemplation, like those souls which are <lb/>
            fond of investigating invisible objects, which it is usual to call <lb/>
            mid wives'? For they also make suitable coverings and phylac­ <lb/>
            teries for souls which are devoted to virtue ; but the strongest <lb/>
            and most defensible abode was the fear of God, to those, at <lb/>
            least, who have him for an impregnable fortress and wall. <lb/>
            " For," says Moses, " when the midwives feared God they <lb/>
            made themselves houses." t</p>
          <p>XXXIX. The mind, therefore, going forth out of the places <lb/>
            which are in Charran, is said " to have travelled through the <lb/>
            land until it came to the place of Sichem, to a lofty oak." ‡ <lb/>
            And let us now consider what this travelling through the land <lb/>
            means. The disposition which is fond of learning is inquisitive <lb/>
            and exceedingly curious by nature, going everywhere without <lb/>
            fear or hesitation and prying into every place, and not choosing <lb/>
            to leave anything in existence, whether person or thing, not <lb/>
            thoroughly investigated; for it is by nature extraordinarily <lb/>
            greedy of everything that can be seen or heard, so as not only <lb/>
            not to be satisfied with the things of its own country, but even <lb/>
            to desire foreign things which are established at a great dis­ <lb/>
            tance. At all events, they say that it is an absurd thing for <lb/>
            merchants and dealers to cross the seas for the sake of gain, <lb/>
            and to travel all round the habitable world, not allowing any <lb/>
            considerations of summer, or winter, or violent gales, or con­ <lb/>
            trary winds, or old age, or bodily sickness, or the society of <lb/>
            friends, or the unspeakable pleasures arising from wife, or <lb/>
            children, or one's other relations, or love of one's country, or <lb/>
            the enjoyment of political connections, or the safe fruition of <lb/>
            one's money and other possessions, or, in fact, anything what­ <lb/>
            ever, whether great or small, to be any hindrance to them ; and <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xxx. 30. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Exodus i 21 </note> <note type="footnote"> ‡ Genesis xii. 6. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="92"/>
            yet for men, for the sake of that most beautiful and desirable <lb/>
            of all possessions, the only one which is peculiar to the human <lb/>
            race, namely, wisdom, to be unwilling to cross over every sea <lb/>
            and to penetrate every recess of the earth, inquiring whenever <lb/>
            they can find anything beautiful either to see or to hear, and <lb/>
            tracing out such things with all imaginable zeal and earnest­ <lb/>
            ness, until they arrive at the enjoyment of the things which <lb/>
            are thus sought for and desired.</p>
          <p>Do thou then, 0 my soul, travel through the land, and through <lb/>
            man, bringing if you think fit, each individual man to a judg­ <lb/>
            ment of the things which concern him ; as, for instance, what <lb/>
            the body is, and under what influences, whether active or <lb/>
            passive, it co-operates with the mind; what the external sense <lb/>
            is, and in what manner that assists the dominant mind; what <lb/>
            speech is, and of what it becomes the interpreter so as to <lb/>
            contribute to virtue; what are pleasure and desire; what are <lb/>
            pain and fear ; and what art is capable of supplying a remedy <lb/>
            for these things; by the aid of which a man when infected <lb/>
            with these feelings may easily escape, or else perhaps may never <lb/>
            be infected at all: what folly is, what intemperance, what com­ <lb/>
            mitting injustice, what the whole multitude of other diseases, <lb/>
            which it is the nature of all destructive vice to engender; and also <lb/>
            what are the means by which they can be averted. And also, on <lb/>
            the contrary, what justice is, what prudence is, and temperance, <lb/>
            and manly courage, and deliberate wisdom, and in short what <lb/>
            each virtue is, and what the mastery over the passions is, and <lb/>
            in what way each of these virtues is usually produced.</p>
          <p>Travel also through the greatest and most perfect being, <lb/>
            namely this world, and consider all its parts, how they are <lb/>
            separated in respect of place and united in respect of power; <lb/>
            and also what is this invisible chain of harmony and unity, <lb/>
            which connects all those parts ; and if while considering these <lb/>
            matters, thou canst not easily comprehend what thou seekest <lb/>
            to know, persevere and be not wearied ; for these matters are <lb/>
            not attainable without a struggle, but they are only found out <lb/>
            with difficulty and by means of much and great labour ; on <lb/>
            which account the mail fond of learning is taken up to the field <lb/>
            of Sichem ; and the name Sichem, being interpreted means, .. a <lb/>
            shoulder," and intimates labour, since it is on the shoulders that <lb/>
            men are accustomed to bear burdens. As Moses also mentions in <lb/>
            another passage, when speaking of a certain athlete he pro­ <lb/>
             <pb n="93"/>
            ceeds in this manner, " He put his shoulder to the labour and <lb/>
            became a husbandman.”*</p>
          <p>So that never, 0 my mind, do thou become effeminate and <lb/>
            yield; but even if any thing does appear difficult to be <lb/>
            discovered by contemplation, still opening the seeing faculties <lb/>
            that are in thyself, look inwards and investigate existing things <lb/>
            more accurately, and never close thy eyes whether intentionally <lb/>
            or unintentionally; for sleep is a blind thing as wakefulness <lb/>
            is a sharp-sighted thing. And it is well to be content if by <lb/>
            assiduity in investigation it is granted to thee to arrive at a <lb/>
            correct conception of the objects of thy search. Do you not <lb/>
            see that the scripture says that a lofty oak was planted in <lb/>
            Sichem ? meaning under this figurative expression to represent <lb/>
            the labour of instruction which never gives in, and never bends <lb/>
            through weariness, but is solid, firm, and invincible, which the <lb/>
            man who wishes to be perfect must of necessity exert, in order <lb/>
            that the tribunal of the soul, by name Dinah, for the interpre­ <lb/>
            tation of the name Dinah is "judgment" may not be seized by <lb/>
            the exertions of that man who, being a plotter against prudence, <lb/>
            is labouring in an opposite direction.</p>
          <p>For he who bears the same name as this place, namely <lb/>
            Sichem. the soil of Hamor, that is, of irrational nature ; for the <lb/>
            name Hamor means " an ass ; " giving himself up to folly and <lb/>
            being bred up with shamelessness and audacity, infamous man <lb/>
            that he was, attempted to pollute and to defile the judicial <lb/>
            faculties of the mind ; if the pupils and friends of wisdom, <lb/>
            Sichem and Levi, had not speedily come up, having made the <lb/>
            defences of their house safe, and destroyed those who were <lb/>
            still involved in the labour devoted to pleasure and to the <lb/>
            indulgence of the passions and uncircumcised. For though <lb/>
            there was a sacred scripture that, " There should be no harlot <lb/>
            among the daughters of the seer, Israel,”† these men, having <lb/>
            ravished a virgin soul, hoped to escape notice ; for there is <lb/>
            never a scarcity of avengers against those who violate treaties ; <lb/>
            but even though some persons fancy there may be, they will <lb/>
            only fancy it, and will in the reality of the fact be proved to <lb/>
            entertain a false opinion.</p>
          <p>For justice hates the wicked, and is implacable, and a relent­ <lb/>
            less avenger of all unrighteous actions, overthrowing the ranks <lb/>
            on those who defile virtue, and when they are overthrown, then <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xlix. 15. </note> <note type="footnote"> † Genesis xxxiv. 1. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="94"/>
            again the soul, which before appeared to be defiled, changes and <lb/>
            returns to its virgin state. I say, which appeared to be <lb/>
            defiled, because, in fact, it never was defiled; for of invo­ <lb/>
            luntary accidents that which affects the patient is not in <lb/>
            reality his suffering, just as what is done by a person who <lb/>
            does wrong unintentionally, the wrong is not really his action.</p>

            the question of rewards to the best of our ability. Our <lb/>
            present purpose is to examine who is the heir of the things of <lb/>
            God; for after the wise man heard the oracle, which being <lb/>
            divinely given, said, " Thy reward is exceedingly great;"* he <lb/>
            inquired, saying, “ What wilt thou give me, 0 master? And I <lb/>
            shall depart childless: but my son who is the child of my <lb/>
            handmaid will inherit after me, this Eliezer of Damascus.'' <lb/>
            And in another place he says, " Since thou hast not given me <lb/>
            any seed, but one born in my house shall be my heir." And <lb/>
            yet who would not have been amazed at the dignity and <lb/>
            greatness of him who delivered this oracle, so as to become <lb/>
            silent and mute before him, if not out of fear, still at all <lb/>
            events from excess of joy ? For excessive griefs stop the <lb/>
            mouth, and so also do excessive joys; on which account Moses <lb/>
            confesses that he is "a man of a slight voice and slow of <lb/>
            speech from the time when God first began to converse with <lb/>
            him.” t</p>
          <p>And this testimony of the prophet is unerring; for it is <lb/>
            natural for the organs of speech to be checked, and for the <lb/>
            reason which is collected in the mind to be borne onwards <lb/>
            with unrestrained impetuosity, philosophically examining the <lb/>
            unceasing beauty of ideas not of words, with fluent and sub­ <lb/>
            lime power ; and the most admirable virtues are boldness and <lb/>
            freedom of speech at suitable times towards one's betters, so <lb/>
            that the sentence in the comic poet appears to me to be uttered <lb/>
            with truth rather than with comic humour:­ <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xv. 1. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Exodus iv. 10. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="95"/>
            If a slave is always dumb, <lb/>
            He is scarcely worth a crumb : <lb/>
            Let him, freely told, boldly speak.</p>
          <p>II. When then has a slave freedom of speech towards his <lb/>
            master? Is it not when he is conscious that he has not <lb/>
            wronged him, but that he has done and said everything with a <lb/>
            view to the advantage of his owner ? When therefore is it <lb/>
            proper for the servant of God to use freedom of speech to the <lb/>
            ruler and master of himself, and of the whole word ? Is it <lb/>
            not when be is free from all sins, and is aware in his con­ <lb/>
            science that he loves his master, feeling more joy at the fact <lb/>
            of being a servant of God, than he would if he were sovereign <lb/>
            over the whole race of mankind, and were invested without <lb/>
            any effort on his part with the supreme authority over land <lb/>
            and sea. And he mentions the ministrations and services by <lb/>
            which Abraham displayed his love to his master in the last <lb/>
            sentence of the divine oracle given to his son, " I will give to <lb/>
            thee and to thy seed all this land, and in thy seed shall all the <lb/>
            nations of the earth be blessed, because Abraham thy father <lb/>
            obeyed my voice, and kept all my precepts, and all my com­ <lb/>
            mandments, and my laws, and my judgments." * And it is the <lb/>
            greatest possible praise of a servant that he does not neglect <lb/>
            a single thing of the commandments which his master lays <lb/>
            upon him, but that he labours earnestly without any hesitation <lb/>
            and with all his vigour, and even beyond his power to perform <lb/>
            them all with a well affected mind.</p>
          <p>III. There are persons, then, to whom it is becoming to listen <lb/>
            but not to speak, with respect to whom it is said, " Be silent <lb/>
            and hear," t a very admirable injunction ; for ignorance is a <lb/>
            very bad and a very audacious thing, the first remedy for <lb/>
            which is silence, and the second, attention to those who pre­ <lb/>
            sent you with anything worthy of your listening to. Let no <lb/>
            one, however, think that this is all that is signified by those <lb/>
            few words, " Be silent and hear; " but that there is also some­ <lb/>
            thing greater in them which may give a lesson to any one. <lb/>
            For these words do not recommend you only to be silent with <lb/>
            your tongues, and to hear with your ears, but also to conduct <lb/>
            yourself thus in both these respects in your soul; for many <lb/>
            persons when they have come to listen to some one, have <lb/>
            nevertheless not come with their minds, but wander outside, <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xxvi. 3. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Deuteronomy xxvii. 9. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="96"/>
            and keep on thinking of thousands upon thousands of things <lb/>
            within themselves, whether concerning their relations, or <lb/>
            strangers, or themselves, which at that moment they ought <lb/>
            not to remember at all, but which in short they, re-collecting <lb/>
            to themselves in regular order, and thus by reason of the ex­ <lb/>
            cessive tumult which they keep alive in themselves, they are <lb/>
            unable to hear the speaker. For he speaks as if he were not <lb/>
            among men, but among inanimate statues who have indeed ears, <lb/>
            but no sense of hearing.</p>
          <p>If, therefore, the mind chooses to associate neither with <lb/>
            things wandering about outside, nor with those which are stored <lb/>
            up within it, but, remaining quiet and silent, directs its whole <lb/>
            attention to the speaker, keeping silent in accordance with the <lb/>
            injunction of Moses, it will be able to listen with all attention, <lb/>
            but otherwise it would not be able to do so.</p>
          <p>IV. Silence, then, is a desirable thing for those who are <lb/>
            ignorant, but for those who desire knowledge, and who have at <lb/>
            the same time a love for their master's freedom of speech, is a <lb/>
            most necessary possession. Accordingly it is said, in the book <lb/>
            of Exodus, " The Lord will fight for us, and you will be silent."* <lb/>
            And, immediately afterwards, there is added a scripture in the <lb/>
            following words: “ And the Lord said unto Moses, Why dost <lb/>
            thou cry unto me ?'' As it is proper for those persons to be <lb/>
            silent who can say nothing worthy of being listened to, and <lb/>
            for those to speak who, through love of wisdom, believe in <lb/>
            God ; and not only to speak quietly but to cry out with exceed­ <lb/>
            ing noise, not indeed with the noise of the mouth and tongue, <lb/>
            by means of which they say that the air is affected with a <lb/>
            rotatory motion, and so is rendered capable of being perceived <lb/>
            by the hearing, but by the all-instructed and very loudly speak­ <lb/>
            ing organ of that voice of which no mortal man is the hearer, <lb/>
            but only the uncreated and immortal God.</p>
          <p>For the well-arranged and carefully attuned melody of that <lb/>
            harmony which is perceptible by the intellect, the invisible <lb/>
            musician, perceptible by the intellect, is alone able to compre­ <lb/>
            hend ; but no one of those involved in the entanglements of the <lb/>
            outward senses can appreciate it. Accordingly, when the <lb/>
            entire organ of the mind sounds according to the symphony of <lb/>
            the diapason and of the double diapason, the hearer, as it were, <lb/>
            asks (for lie does not ask in reality, since everything is known <note type="footnote"> * Exodus xiv. 4. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="97"/>
            to God), "Why dost thou cry unto me?" Is it in supplica­ <lb/>
            tion that evils may be averted, or in thankfulness for a par­ <lb/>
            ticipation in good things which have been already enjoyed, or <lb/>
            for a combination of both reasons ?</p>
          <p>V. But the man who appears to be endued with a thin <lb/>
            voice, and with slowness of speech, and to be almost dumb, is <lb/>
            nevertheless found to be talkative, so that in one place he is <lb/>
            represented not merely as speaking, but even as crying out; <lb/>
            and, in another, as exerting a ceaseless and uninterrupted flow <lb/>
            of words ; for, says the scripture, " Moses spoke, and God <lb/>
            answered him with a voice.”* He did not speak in brief <lb/>
            periods or sentences, but in one continuously extended speech ; <lb/>
            and God also instructed him, not in brief sentences, but gave <lb/>
            him one unbroken and continuous answer. And whenever <lb/>
            there is an answer, there then must of necessity have been, in <lb/>
            every case, a question. But whenever any one puts a question <lb/>
            it is respecting something which he does not know, because he <lb/>
            is desirous to learn; inasmuch as he is aware that there is no­ <lb/>
            thing so useful with regard to acquiring knowledge as to ask, <lb/>
            to inquire, to investigate, to appear to know nothing, and not <lb/>
            to have an idea that one comprehends anything firmly.</p>
          <p>The wise, therefore, take God for their teacher and instructor; <lb/>
            and those who are less perfectly initiated in wisdom take the <lb/>
            wise men for theirs. On which account they say, also, " Do <lb/>
            thou speak with us, and let not God speak to us, lest we die."t <lb/>
            And the virtuous man uses such freedom of speech as not only <lb/>
            to speak and cry out, but even to advance positive claims with <lb/>
            true confidence and genuine feeling; for the expression, " If <lb/>
            thou forgivest them their sin, forgive them ; and if not, then <lb/>
            wipe me out of the book which thou hast written." ‡ And this <lb/>
            sentence also, "Did I conceive all this people in my womb? <lb/>
            Or have I brought them forth, that thou sayest unto me, Take <lb/>
            them up into thy bosom, as a nurse takes her sucking child.”§ <lb/>
            And also that passage where we read, " From whence am I to <lb/>
            get flesh to give to all this people, because they cry unto me ? <lb/>
            Shall sheep and oxen be sacrificed, or shall all the fish of the <lb/>
            sea be collected together, to satisfy them ?" And again, “ Lord, <lb/>
            why hast thou afflicted this people ?" And again, “ Why hast <lb/>
            thou sent me ?" And, in another place, " From the time that <note type="footnote"> * Exodus xix. 19. </note><note type="footnote"> ‡ Exodus xxxii. 32. </note> <note type="footnote"> + Exodus xx 19. </note><note type="footnote"> § Numbers xi. 11. </note> <note type="footnote"> VOL. II </note> <note type="footnote"> H </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="98"/>
            I went forth to speak to Pharaoh in thy name, he has afflicted <lb/>
            the people." And again. " Thou hast not delivered thy <lb/>
            people."* For these, and similar things, any one would have <lb/>
            feared to say to any king of this earth; but to deliver such <lb/>
            sentiments, and to speak freely to God, was an instance of <lb/>
            what ought not to be called extreme audacity, but of good con­ <lb/>
            fidence ; because all the wise are dear to God, and especially <lb/>
            those who are wise with the wisdom of the most sacred giving <lb/>
            of the law.</p>
          <p>And freedom of speech is nearly akin to friendship; since <lb/>
            to whom would any one speak with more freedom than to his <lb/>
            own friend? very appropriately therefore is Moses spoken of <lb/>
            in the scriptures as dear to God, when he goes through an <lb/>
            account of all the dangers which he had incurred by reason of <lb/>
            his boldness, in such a way that they seem to deserve to be <lb/>
            attributed to friendship rather than to arrogance ; for audacity <lb/>
            belongs to the character of the arrogant man ; but good con­ <lb/>
            fidence belongs to the friend.</p>
          <p>VI. But consider again that confidence is tempered with <lb/>
            prudent caution ; for the question, " What wilt thou give to <lb/>
            me?”‡ displays confidence, and the addition, "0 master," <lb/>
            exhibits prudent confidence. And being in the habit of using <lb/>
            two causes or two appellations, with respect to the cause of all <lb/>
            things, namely the title of Lord, and also that of God, he has <lb/>
            in this instance used neither of them, but calls them by the name <lb/>
            of master, speaking with caution and with exceeding propriety; <lb/>
            and indeed the two appellations lord and master, are said to <lb/>
            be synonymous. But even if the two names are one and the <lb/>
            same things, still the titles differ in respect of the meaning <lb/>
            attached to them; for the title lord, <unclear>δύϱιος</unclear>, is derived from <lb/>
            the word, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ϰυ̃ϱος</foreign> authority, which is a firm thing, in contra­ <lb/>
            distinction to that which is infirm and invalid, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἅϰυϱον</foreign>.But <lb/>
            the term master, <foreign xml:lang="grc">δεσπότης</foreign>, is derived from <foreign xml:lang="grc">δεσμὸς</foreign>, a chain ; from <lb/>
            which word <foreign xml:lang="grc">δέος</foreign>, fear, also comes in my opinion, so that the <lb/>
            master is a lord, and, as one may say a lord, to be feared, not <lb/>
            only inasmuch as he has authority and dominion over every <lb/>
            thing, but also inasmuch as he is able to strike one with fear and <lb/>
            terror; and perhaps also since he is the master of the universe; <note type="footnote"> * Exodus v. 22. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Deut, xxxiii. 1. </note> <note type="footnote"> ‡ Genesis xv. 2. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="99"/>
            holding it together in such a manner as to be insoluble, and <lb/>
            binding up again what portions of it are dissolved.</p>
          <p>But he who says, “ Master, what wilt thou give unto me ? ” <lb/>
            does, in the real meaning of his words say, this, " I am not <lb/>
            ignorant of thy overpowering might, and I know the formidable <lb/>
            nature of thy sovereignty: I fear and tremble, and again I feel <lb/>
            confidence; for thou hast given me an oracular command not <lb/>
            fear, thou 'hast given to me the tongue of instruction, that I <lb/>
            might know when I ought to speak; thou hast unloosened my <lb/>
            mouth which before was sewed up, thou hast opened it, and <lb/>
            hast also made it articulate; thou hast appointed it to utter <lb/>
            what ought to be spoken, confirming that sacred oracle, " I will <lb/>
            open thy mouth, and I will tell thee what thou oughtest to <lb/>
            speak." * For who was I, that thou shouldest give me a portion <lb/>
            of thy speech, that thou shouldest promise me a reward as in <lb/>
            it were my due, namely, a more perfect blessing of thy grace <lb/>
            and bounty ? Am I not an emigrant from my country ? am I <lb/>
            not driven away from my kindred ? am I not banished and <lb/>
            alienated from my father's house ? do not all men call me an <lb/>
            outcast and a fugitive, a desolate and dishonoured man ? but <lb/>
            thou, 0 master, art my country, thou art my kindred, thou art my <lb/>
            paternal hearth, thou art my honour, thou art my freedom of <lb/>
            speech, my great, and famous, and inalienable wealth, why <lb/>
            therefore shall I not have courage to say what I think ? and <lb/>
            why shall I not ask questions, when I desire to learn something <lb/>
            more 9</p>
          <p>But nevertheless, though I say that I feel confidence, I do <lb/>
            again confess that I am stricken with awe and amazement, and <lb/>
            that I do not feel within myself an unmixed spirit of battle, <lb/>
            but fear mingled with confidence, as perhaps many people will <lb/>
            easily imagine, a closely combined conjunction of the two <lb/>
            feelings; therefore I drink insatiably of this well-mixed cup, <lb/>
            which persuades me neither to speak freely without prudent <lb/>
            caution ; nor, on the other hand, to think so much of caution as <lb/>
            to lose my freedom of speech. For I have learnt to appre­ <lb/>
            ciate my own nothingness, and to look up to the excessive and <lb/>
            unapproachable height of thy munificence: and whenever I know <lb/>
            that I am myself " but dust and ashes," or even, what is still more <lb/>
            worthless, if there is any such thing, then I feel confidence to <lb/>
            approach thee, humbling myself, and casting myself down to <note type="footnote"> * Exodus iv. 12. </note> <note type="footnote"> H 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="100"/>
            the ground, so completely changed as scarcely to seem to <lb/>
            exist.</p>
          <p>VII. Now such a disposition of the soul, Abraham, the <lb/>
            inspector, has deeply engraved on my memory. For, says the <lb/>
            scripture, " Abraham came near and said, Now have I begun <lb/>
            to speak unto the Lord, I that am but dust and ashes * <lb/>
            since then there was an opportunity given to the creature to <lb/>
            approach the Creator, when he recognised his own nothingness. <lb/>
            But the expression, “ What wilt thou give me?" is not so much <lb/>
            the language of one who is in doubt, as of one feeling and <lb/>
            expressing gratitude at the multitude and greatness of the <lb/>
            blessings which he has already enjoyed. “ What wilt thou <lb/>
            give me ?" for, in fact, what more is there left for me to ex­ <lb/>
            pect ? for, 0 bountiful God! thy graces and mercies are <lb/>
            boundless and unlimited, and they have no boundary and no <lb/>
            end, bursting up like fountains full of perfection, which are <lb/>
            continually drawn upon and are never dry. And it is worth <lb/>
            while to contemplate, not merely the ever-abounding torrent <lb/>
            of thy bounties, but also those fields of ours which are irri­ <lb/>
            gated by them ; for if a superfluous and too excessive stream <lb/>
            be poured over them, then the place will become a marshy <lb/>
            and swampy plain instead of fertile land: for our land has <lb/>
            need of irrigation, carefully measured out with a view to cause <lb/>
            fertility, and not unmeasured. And on this account I will <lb/>
            ask, What wilt thou give me, thou who hast already be­ <lb/>
            stowed on me unspeakable mercies, and almost all things, so <lb/>
            that mortal nature is incapable of containing them ? For what <lb/>
            remains that I wish to know, and to have, and to acquire, is <lb/>
            this : who could be worthy of thy works, who could deserve to <lb/>
            inherit them ?</p>
          <p>"I shall depart from life childless ;”† having received a <lb/>
            short-lived and ephemeral blessing, which speedily passes <lb/>
            away, when I prayed for the contrary, namely, for one which <lb/>
            should last many days, a long time; which should be free <lb/>
            from all mishap, which should never die, but should be able to <lb/>
            sow seeds of itself, and to stretch forth roots for the sake of <lb/>
            giving it firmness, and which should raise its trunk upwards <lb/>
            to heaven, and hold its head on high; for it is necessary that <lb/>
            human virtue must walk upon the earth, and must, at the <lb/>
            same time, strive to reach heaven; that there being hospi- <note type="footnote"> Genesis xviii. 27. </note> <note type="footnote"> † Genesis xv. 2. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="101"/>
            tably received by immortality, it may pass all future time in <lb/>
            freedom from all evil, for I know that thou hatest a barren <lb/>
            and unproductive soul, thou who art thyself the supporter of <lb/>
            things that have no existence, and the parent of all things. <lb/>
            Since thou hast given especial grace to the race which has the <lb/>
            faculty of seeing, so that it shall never be barren, and never <lb/>
            be childless; and as I myself have been assigned to that race <lb/>
            as a part of it, I am justly desirous of an heir; for, perceiving <lb/>
            that that race is inextinguishable, I think it would be a most <lb/>
            shameful thing of me to be indifferent to the sight of my own <lb/>
            nature, separated from all that is good.</p>
          <p>Therefore I am a suppliant to thee, and I implore thee, that <lb/>
            those seeds and sparks being kindled and cherished, the saving <lb/>
            light of virtue may burn up and give light, which being borne <lb/>
            on like a torch, delivered from hand to hand in constant suc­ <lb/>
            cession, may last as long as the world. Moreover, thou hast <lb/>
            inspired those men who practise virtue with a desire for chil­ <lb/>
            dren of the sowing and generation of the soul; and they, <lb/>
            having received such a portion have, in their joy, spoken and <lb/>
            said, “ The children which God hath mercifully given to thy <lb/>
            servant,"* of whom migration is the nurse and guardian, <lb/>
            whose souls are simple, and tender, and well disposed, being <lb/>
            calculated easily to receive the beautiful and most God-like im­ <lb/>
            pressions of virtue ; and teach me also this saying, " Whether <lb/>
            the son of Meshech, my servant, born in my house, is compe­ <lb/>
            tent to become the inheritor of thy graces," for up to this <lb/>
            time I have not received the SOIl whom I hoped for, and of <lb/>
            the one whom I have received I have no hope.</p>
          <p>VIII. But who Meshech is, and who her son is, must be <lb/>
            examined in no superficial manner. Now the interpretation <lb/>
            of the name Meshecb is, “ out of a kiss ;” but a kiss differs from <lb/>
            loving ; for the one exhibits usually a discovery of souls united <lb/>
            together by good-will, but the other intimates only a bare and <lb/>
            superficial salutation when some necessity has brought the two <lb/>
            parties to the same place. For as the meaning " to stoop <lb/>
            (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ϰύπτειν</foreign>) is not contained in (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀναϰύπτειν</foreign>) " to lift up the bead, <lb/>
            nor "to drink" (<foreign xml:lang="grc">πίνω</foreign>) in, "to absorb" (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ϰαταπίνω</foreign>), nor "a <lb/>
            horse" (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἵππος</foreign>) in the word (<foreign xml:lang="grc">μάϱσιππος</foreign>) "a bag," so also " to <lb/>
            love" (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ϕιλε</foreign>ĩ<foreign xml:lang="grc">ν</foreign>) is not necessarily contained in "to kiss" (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ϰατα­ <lb/>
            ϕιλε</foreign>ĩ<foreign xml:lang="grc">ν</foreign>); since men yielding to the bitter necessities of life <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xxxiii. 5. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="102"/>
            offer this salutation to numbers of their enemies. But what <lb/>
            that salutation is which consists of a kiss, but not of sincere <lb/>
            friendship for us, I will explain without any reservation or <lb/>
            concealment. It is, forsooth, that life which exists in union <lb/>
            with the external senses, which is called Meshech, being com­ <lb/>
            pletely secured and defended, which there is no one who does <lb/>
            not love, which men in general look upon as their mistress, <lb/>
            but which virtuous men consider their handmaid, not a foreign <lb/>
            slave or one bought with a price, but born in the house, and in <lb/>
            some sense, a fellow citizen with themselves. Well, one class <lb/>
            of these men have learnt to kiss this, not to love it; but the <lb/>
            other class have learnt to love it to excess, and to think it an <lb/>
            object of desire above all things.</p>
          <p>But Laban, the hater of virtue, will neither be able to kiss <lb/>
            the virtues which are assigned to the man who is inclined to <lb/>
            the practice of virtue, but, making his own life to depend on <lb/>
            hypocrisy and false pretences, he, as if indignant, for he is not <lb/>
            in reality affected, says, " I was not accounted worthy to kiss <lb/>
            my children and my daughters;"* speaking very naturally <lb/>
            and decorously, for we have all been taught to hate irony <lb/>
            irreconcileably. Do thou, therefore, love the virtues, and <lb/>
            embrace them with thy soul, and then you will be not at all <lb/>
            desirous to kiss, which is but the false money of friendship ;— <lb/>
            " For have they not yet any part or inheritance in thy house ? <lb/>
            • have they not been reckoned as aliens before thee ? and hast <lb/>
            not thou sold them and devoured the money ? † " so that you <lb/>
            could neither at any subsequent time recover it, after having <lb/>
            devoured the price of their safety and their ransom. Do you <lb/>
            pretend, therefore, to wish to kiss, or else to wage endless war <lb/>
            against all the judges ? But Aaron will not kiss Moses, <lb/>
            though he will love him with the genuine affection of his <lb/>
            heart. “For,” says the scripture, " he loved him, and they <lb/>
            embraced one another. ‡</p>
          <p>IX. But there are three kinds of life. The first life, to <lb/>
            God; the second, with respect to the creature ; the third, is <lb/>
            on the borders of both, being compounded of the two others. <lb/>
            Now, the life to God has not descended to us, and has not <lb/>
            come to the necessities of the body. Again, life with respect <lb/>
            to the creature has not wholly ascended up to heaven, nor has <lb/>
            it sought to ascend, but it lurks in unapproachable recesses, and <note type="footnote"> ∗ Genesis xxxi. 28. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Genesis xxxi. 14. </note> <note type="footnote"> ‡ Exodus xviii. 7. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="103"/>
            rejoices in a life which is no life. And the mingled kind is <lb/>
            that one which often ascends upwards, being conducted up­ <lb/>
            wards by the better part, and it gazes on divine things, and <lb/>
            contemplates them ; but still it often turns back, being dragged <lb/>
            in the contrary direction by the worse part: and when the <lb/>
            portion of the better life, as if placed in the balance of a scale, <lb/>
            outweighs the whole, then the weight of the opposite kinds of <lb/>
            life is dragged in the contrary direction, so that the lightest <lb/>
            weight appears to be in the opposite scale.</p>
          <p>But Moses having, without any contest or doubt, given the <lb/>
            crown of victory to that kind of life which is life to God, brings <lb/>
            that forward as the best, likening the other two kinds to two <lb/>
            women, one of whom he calls beloved, and the other hated, <lb/>
            giving them both most appropriate names. For who is there <lb/>
            who is not at times influenced by the pleasures and delights <lb/>
            which he receives by means of his eyes, or by those which reach <lb/>
            him through the medium of his ears, or of his sense of taste, <lb/>
            or of his sense of smell and touch ? And who is there who <lb/>
            does not hate the contrary things, want and self-denial, and a <lb/>
            life of austerity, and seeking after knowledge, which has never <lb/>
            any share in amusement or laughter, but is full of gravity, and <lb/>
            cares and labours, loving contemplation, an enemy to ignorance, <lb/>
            superior to money, and glory, and pleasure, but under the do­ <lb/>
            minion of temperance and true glory, and of that wealth which <lb/>
            sees and is not blind ? These, then, are at all times the eldest <lb/>
            offspring of wisdom.</p>
          <p>X. But Moses thinks those things which, though younger <lb/>
            in point of time are nevertheless honourable by nature, worthy <lb/>
            of the first honours of the birth-right, giving them a double <lb/>
            share, and taking from the others half of their share ; for, says <lb/>
            he, “ If a man have two wives, the one beloved and the other <lb/>
            hated, and if they both bear children, then when he is about <lb/>
            to distribute his property, he shall not be able to give the <lb/>
            portion belonging to the first-born to the son of her who is <lb/>
            beloved,”* namely, to the son of pleasure ; for he is but young, <lb/>
            even though in point of time he may be old; but he looks <lb/>
            upon the son of her who is hated, namely, of wisdom, as the <lb/>
            elder, ever since he was a child; and, accordingly, to him he <lb/>
            has assigned a double share.</p>
          <p>But because we have, on a previous occasion, explained the <note type="footnote"> * Deuteronomy xxi. 15. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="104"/>
            figurative sense of this passage, we will now pass on to what <lb/>
            comes next, to the passage before us ; after we have first ex­ <lb/>
            plained this point, that “ God is said to have opened the <lb/>
            womb of her who was hated," and thus to have caused to arise <lb/>
            an offspring of virtuous practices and good actions, while the <lb/>
            wife, who was reputed to be beloved, was from that time forth <lb/>
            barren: " For the Lord," says the scripture, " seeing that <lb/>
            Leah was hated, opened her womb, but Rachel was barren."* <lb/>
            Is it not then the case, that when the soul is pregnant, and <lb/>
            begins to bring forth such things as are becoming to the soul, <lb/>
            then all those objects of the outward senses are barren and <lb/>
            unproductive, objects to which the salutation belongs, which is <lb/>
            given by a kiss and not by genuine affection ?</p>
          <p>XI. Each individual then among us is the son of life ac­ <lb/>
            cording to the outward sense, which he calls Meshech, honour­ <lb/>
            ing and admiring the foster-mother and nurse of the mortal <lb/>
            race, namely, the outward sense, whom also, when the earthly <lb/>
            mind, by name Adam, saw after it had been created, he <lb/>
            named her life his own death ; for, says the scripture, “ Adam <lb/>
            called his wife's name Eve because she was the mother <lb/>
            of all living,"t that is to say, of those who are in real truth <lb/>
            dead as to the life of the soul; but they who really live have <lb/>
            wisdom for their mother and the outward sense for their slave, <lb/>
            which has been created by nature for the purpose of minister­ <lb/>
            in,, to knowledge; and the name of that man who was born of <lb/>
            life (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ζωὴ</foreign>), whom we have recognized by a kiss, he calls <lb/>
            Damascus, which name, being interpreted, means " the blood <lb/>
            of a sack;" by this figurative language, calling the body a <lb/>
            sack with great power and felicity; and by blood, he means <lb/>
            the life which depends on the blood.</p>
          <p>For since the soul is spoken of in two ways, first of all as <lb/>
            a whole, secondly, as to the dominant part of it, which, to <lb/>
            speak properly, is the soul of the soul, just as the eye is both <lb/>
            the whole orb, and also the most important part of that orb, <lb/>
            that namely by which we see; it seemed good to the law-giver <lb/>
            that the essence of the soul should likewise be two-fold; blood <lb/>
            being the essence of the entire soul, and the divine Spirit <lb/>
            being the essence of the dominant part of it: accordingly he <lb/>
            says, in express words, " The soul of all flesh is the blood <lb/>
            thereof.”‡ He does well here to attribute the flow of blood to <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xxix. 31. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Genesis iii. 20. </note> <note type="footnote"> ‡ Genesis ix. 8. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="105"/>
            the mass of flesh, combining two things appropriate to one <lb/>
            another; but the essence of the mind he has not made to de­ <lb/>
            pend on any created thing, but has represented it as breathed <lb/>
            into man by God from above. For, says Moses, " The Crea­ <lb/>
            tor of the universe breathed into his face the breath of life, <lb/>
            and man became a living soul,"* who also, it is recorded, <lb/>
            was fashioned after the image of the Creator.</p>
          <p>XII. So that the race of mankind also is twofold, the one <lb/>
            being the race of those who live by the divine Spirit and <lb/>
            reason ; the other of those who exist according to blood and <lb/>
            the pleasure of the flesh. This species is formed of the earth, <lb/>
            but that other is an accurate copy of the divine image; and <lb/>
            that description of us which is but fashioned clay, and which is <lb/>
            kneaded up with blood, has need, in no slight degree, of as­ <lb/>
            sistance from God; on which account it is said, this Damas­ <lb/>
            cus of Eleazar.t But the name Eleazar, being interpreted, <lb/>
            means, " God is my helper." Since the mass of the body, <lb/>
            which is filled with blood, being of itself easily dissolved and <lb/>
            dead, has its existence through, and is kept alive by, the pro­ <lb/>
            vidence of God, who holds his arm and shield of defence over <lb/>
            it, while our race cannot, by any resources of its own, exist in <lb/>
            a state of firmness and safety for a single day.</p>
          <p>Do you not see that the second of the sons of Moses has also <lb/>
            the same name as this man ? For " the name of the second," <lb/>
            says the scripture, " was Eleazar.”‡ And he adds the reason : <lb/>
            " for the Lord has been my helper, and has delivered me out <lb/>
            of the hand of Pharaoh." But those who are still companions <lb/>
            of that life which owes its existence to blood, and which is <lb/>
            appreciable by the outward senses, are attacked by that <lb/>
            disposition which is such a formidable disperser of piety, by <lb/>
            name Pharaoh; from whose sovereignty, full as it is of law­ <lb/>
            lessness and cruelty, it is impossible to escape, unless Eleazar <lb/>
            be born in the soul, and unless one puts one's hope of succour <lb/>
            in the only Saviour.</p>
          <p>And it is with particular beauty that he speaks of Damascus <lb/>
            with reference, not to his father, but to his mother; in order <lb/>
            to show that the soul depending on blood, by means of which <lb/>
            the brute animals live, is akin properly to the female race ; <lb/>
            the race of his mother, and has no share in the male race. <lb/>
            But this is not the case with virtue, that is with Sarah ; for she <note type="footnote">* Genesis ii. 7. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Genesis xv. 2. </note> <note type="footnote"> ‡ Exodus xviii. 4. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="106"/>
            has none but a male offspring, being borne only of God who is <lb/>
            the father of all things, being that authority which has no <lb/>
            mother. " For truly," says the scripture, “she is my sister <lb/>
            Ly my father's side, but not by my mother’s.”*</p>
          <p>XIII. We have now explained what it was necessary for you <lb/>
            to be apprised of as a preliminary. For the first part of the <lb/>
            argument had a sort of enigmatical obscurity. But we must <lb/>
            examine with more accurate particularity what the man who is <lb/>
            fond of learning seeks. Perhaps then it is something of this <lb/>
            sort: to know whether any one who is desirous of that life which <lb/>
            is dependent on blood and who claims an'interest in the objects <lb/>
            of the outward sense, can become an inheritor of incorporeal <lb/>
            and divine things ? for of such only he who is inspired from <lb/>
            above is thought worthy, having received a portion of heavenly <lb/>
            and divine inheritance, being in fact the most pure mind, <lb/>
            disregarding not merely the body but also the other fragment <lb/>
            of the soul, which being devoid of reason is mixed up with <lb/>
            blood, kindling the fervid passions and excited appetites. <lb/>
            Accordingly it pushes its inquiries in this manner: since <lb/>
            you have not given to me a seed which is capable of becoming <lb/>
            its own instructor, namely, that seed which is able to be corn <lb/>
            prehended by the intellect, " Shall the slave born in my house <lb/>
            be my heir ?" the offspring of that life which is dependent <lb/>
            upon blood. Then God, making haste, anticipated the speaker, <lb/>
            sending, as one may say, instruction on in advance of speech. <lb/>
            " For immediately, says the scripture, “ the voice of God <lb/>
            came to him, saying, He shall not be thy heir nor any one <lb/>
            else of those who come to an exhibition of the outward senses. <lb/>
            For the incorporeal natures are the inheritors of those things <lb/>
            which can only be appreciated by the intellect.</p>
          <p>And it has been especially observed here, that the scripture <lb/>
            does not say he spoke to him or conversed with him, but the <lb/>
            expression is, “ The voice of God came to him;" as if God <lb/>
            uttering a loud and unceasing sound, in order that the voice <lb/>
            being thus distributed into every soul, might leave no part <lb/>
            destitute of proper instruction, but that all parts might every <lb/>
            where be filled with healthy learning.</p>
          <p>XIV. Who, then, shall be the heir? Not that reasoning <lb/>
            which remains in the prison of the body according to its own <lb/>
            voluntary intention, but that which is loosened from those <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xx. 12. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Genesis xv. 3. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="107"/>
            bonds and emancipated, and which has advanced beyond the <lb/>
            walls, and if it be possible to say so, has itself forsaken itself. <lb/>
            " For he," says the scripture, " who shall come out from thee, <lb/>
            he shall be thy heir." Therefore if any desire comes upon <lb/>
            thee, 0 soul, to be the inheritor of the good things of God, <lb/>
            leave not only thy country,* the body, and thy kindred, the <lb/>
            outward senses, and thy father's house, that is speech; but <lb/>
            also flee from thyself, and depart out of thyself, like the <lb/>
            Cerybantes, or those possessed with demons, being driven to <lb/>
            frenzy, and inspired by some prophetic inspiration. For while <lb/>
            the mind is in a state of enthusiastic inspiration, and while it <lb/>
            is no longer mistress of itself, but is agitated and drawn into <lb/>
            frenzy by heavenly love, and drawn upwards to that object, <lb/>
            truth removing all impediments out of its way, and making <lb/>
            every thing before it plain, that so it may advance by a level <lb/>
            and easy road, its destiny is to become an inheritor of the <lb/>
            things of God.</p>
          <p>But, 0 mind ! take confidence, and explain to us how you de­ <lb/>
            part and emigrate from those former things, you who utter things <lb/>
            perceptible only by the intellect to those who have been taught <lb/>
            to hear rightly, always saying, I emigrated from my sojourn in <lb/>
            the body when I learnt to despise the flesh, and I emigrated <lb/>
            from the outward sense when I learnt to look upon the objects <lb/>
            of outward sense as things which had no existence in reality- <lb/>
            condemning its judicial faculties as spurious and corrupted, and <lb/>
            full of false opinion, and also condemning the objects submit­ <lb/>
            ted to that judgment as speciously devised to allure and to de­ <lb/>
            ceive, and to snatch the truth from out of the middle of nature. <lb/>
            Again, I departed from speech when I convicted it of great <lb/>
            unreasonableness, although it talked of sublime subjects and <lb/>
            puffed itself up ; for it dared a not inconsiderable deed of daring, <lb/>
            namely, to show me bodies through the medium of shadows, <lb/>
            and things by means of words, which was impossible; therefore <lb/>
            it kept stumbling about over repeated obstacles, and kept on <lb/>
            talking vainly, being unable by common expressions to give a <lb/>
            clear representation and understanding of the peculiar proper­ <lb/>
            ties of the subjects with which it was dealing. But I, learning <lb/>
            by experience, like an infant and untaught child, decided <lb/>
            that it was better to depart from all these things, and to attri­ <lb/>
            bute the powers of each to God, who makes and consolidates <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xii. 1. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="108"/>
            the body, and who prepares the outward senses so as to feel <lb/>
            appropriately, and who gives to speech the power of speaking <lb/>
            at its desire; and in the same manner in which you have de­ <lb/>
            parted from the other things, now rise up and emigrate from <lb/>
            thyself. But what is the meaning of this expression ? Do <lb/>
            not treasure up in thyself the faculties of perceiving, and think­ <lb/>
            ing, and comprehending, but offer and dedicate these things to <lb/>
            him who is the cause of thinking accurately, and of compre­ <lb/>
            hending without being deceived.</p>
          <p>XV. But it is the holier of the all-sacred places in the <lb/>
            temple which receives this offering ; for it appears that there <lb/>
            are two ; the one discernible only by the intellect, and the other <lb/>
            perceptible by the outward senses. Now, of these creatures <lb/>
            which are perceptible by the outward senses, this world is the <lb/>
            receptacle ; but of those things which are truly invisible, the <lb/>
            world, which is discernible only by the intellect, is the maga­ <lb/>
            zine : but he that goes out from us and desires to become an <lb/>
            attendant of God, is the inheritor of the much celebrated <lb/>
            wealth of nature; he bears witness, who says, " He brought <lb/>
            him out, and said unto him, Lookup to heaven;"* since that <lb/>
            is the treasury of the good things of God. " May the Lord," <lb/>
            says he, " open to thee the treasury of his good things,†”—that <lb/>
            is, the heaven ; out of which he who furnishes the supply does <lb/>
            incessantly rain the most perfect joys.</p>
          <p>Look up, then, so as to convict the blind race of common <lb/>
            men, which, though it appears to see, is blind. For how can <lb/>
            it be otherwise than blind, when it sees evil instead of good, <lb/>
            and what is unjust instead of what is just, and the indulgence <lb/>
            of the passions, instead of a mastery over them, and things <lb/>
            mortal, instead of things immortal, and when it runs away <lb/>
            from its monitors and correctors, and from conviction and in­ <lb/>
            struction, and admits flatterers, and the reasonings of idleness, <lb/>
            and ignorance, and luxury, all exerted in the cause of pleasure ? <lb/>
            The good man, then, alone sees; in reference to whom the <lb/>
            ancients also called the prophets, seers.‡</p>
          <p>But he who advanced further outwards, not only seeing, but <lb/>
            seeing God, was called Israel; the meaning of which name is, <lb/>
            .. seeing God." But others, even if they ever do open their eyes, <lb/>
            still bend them down towards the earth, pursuing only earthly <lb/>
            things, and being bred up among material objects ; for the one <lb/>
            raises his eyes to the sky, beholding the manna, the divine <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xv. 5. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Dent. xxviii. 12. </note> <note type="footnote"> ‡ 1 Samuel ix. 9. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="109"/>
            word, the heavenly, incorruptible food of the soul, which is food <lb/>
            of contemplation: but the others fix their eyes on garlic and <lb/>
            onions, food which causes pain to the eyes, and troubles the <lb/>
            sight, and makes men wink, and on other unsavoury food, of <lb/>
            leeks, and dead fish, the appropriate provender of Egypt. <lb/>
            " For," says the scripture, "we remembered the fish which we <lb/>
            ate in Egypt without payment, and the gourds, and the cucum­ <lb/>
            bers, the leeks, the onions, and the garlic ; but now our soul is <lb/>
            dry, and our eyes behold nothing but manna.”*</p>
          <p>XVI. And the statement, "He led him out ”† (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐξήγαγεν αὐτὸν <lb/>
            ἔξω</foreign>), has a bearing also on moral considerations, though some <lb/>
            persons, through their want of instruction in moral philosophy, <lb/>
            are accustomed to ridicule it, saying, " For is any one ever led <lb/>
            out in (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἔξω εἰσάγεται</foreign>), or led in out (<foreign xml:lang="grc">εἰσέϱχεται ἔξω</foreign>)?” "Certainly," <lb/>
            I would reply, "you ridiculous and very foolish man ; for you <lb/>
            have never learnt how to trace the dispositions of the soul; <lb/>
            but by this language of yours you only seek to understand those <lb/>
            motions of bodies which are exerted in change of place. On <lb/>
            which account it seems paradoxical to you to speak of any one <lb/>
            coming out into (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐξέϱχεται εἴσω</foreign>), or going in out (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ὲξέϱχεται <lb/>
            ἔξω</foreign>); but to those acquainted with Moses none of these things <lb/>
            seem inconsistent."</p>
          <p>Would you not say that the perfect high priest when, being <lb/>
            in the inmost shrine, lie is performing his national sacrifices, is <lb/>
            both within and without at the same time ? within in respect <lb/>
            of his visible body, but without in respect of his soul, which is <lb/>
            roaming about and wandering ? And again, on the other hand, <lb/>
            would you not say that a man who was not of the family <lb/>
            consecrated to the priesthood, but who was a lover of God and <lb/>
            beloved by God, though standing without the holy shrine, was <lb/>
            nevertheless in reality in its inmost parts ? looking upon his <lb/>
            whole life in the body as a sojourning in a foreign land ; but <lb/>
            while he is able to live only in the soul, then he thinks that <lb/>
            he is abiding in his own country.</p>
          <p>For every fool is outside of friendship, even though he may <lb/>
            not depart for one moment from daily association with people <lb/>
            But every wise man is within friendship, even if lie be dwelling <lb/>
            at a distance, not merely in a different country, but in another <lb/>
            climate and region of the world. But, according to Moses, a <lb/>
            friend is so near to one as to differ in no respect from one’s <note type="footnote"> * Numbers xi. 5. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Genesis xv. 5. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="110"/>
            own soul, for he says, " the friend who is like thy soul.”* And <lb/>
            again he says, " The priest shall not be a man by himself, when <lb/>
            he goeth into the holy of holies, until he cometh out;” † speak­ <lb/>
            ing not with reference to the motions of the body, but to those <lb/>
            of the soul; for the mind, while it is offering holy sacrifices <lb/>
            to God in all purity, is not a human but a divine mind; but <lb/>
            when it is serving any human object, it then descends from <lb/>
            heaven and becomes changed, or rather it falls to the earth and <lb/>
            goes out, even though the mind may still remain within.</p>
          <p>Very correctly, therefore, it is said, he led him out (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ὲξήγαγεν <lb/>
            ἔξω</foreign>) of the prison according to the body, of the caves existing <lb/>
            in the external senses, of the sophistries displayed in deceit­ <lb/>
            ful speech ; and beyond all this, out of himself and out of the <lb/>
            idea that by his own self-exerted, self-implanted, and inde­ <lb/>
            pendent power he was able to conceive and comprehend.</p>
          <p>XVII, And after he has conducted him out, he says to him, <lb/>
            " Look up to heaven, and count the stars, if thou art able to <lb/>
            number them; thus shall be thy seed.” ‡ He says very beautifully, <lb/>
            "Thus shall be thy seed, not so great shall it be, equal in number <lb/>
            to the stars ; for he does not intend here to allude to their mul­ <lb/>
            titude only, but also to an infinite number of other circum­ <lb/>
            stances which contribute to entire and perfect happiness. " Thus <lb/>
            shall thy seed be," says God, as the ethereal firmament which <lb/>
            thou beholdest, so heavenly, so full of unshadowed and pure <lb/>
            brilliancy (for night is driven away from heaven, and darkness <lb/>
            from virtue,) most thoroughly like the stars, beautifully adorned, <lb/>
            having an arrangement which knows no deviation, but which is <lb/>
            always the same and proceeding in the same way. For he means <lb/>
            him to speak of the soul of the wise man as a copy of heaven, or, <lb/>
            if one may use such a hyperbolical expression, as an actual heaven <lb/>
            upon earth, having pure appearances in the air, and well <lb/>
            arranged motions, and harmonious progress, and periodical <lb/>
            revolutions of divine character, star-like and brilliant rays of <lb/>
            virtue.</p>
          <p>But if it is impossible to find out the number of the stars <lb/>
            which are perceptible by the outward senses, how much more <lb/>
            so must it be to count those which are discernible only by the <lb/>
            intellect? for in proportion, I suppose, as that which judges is <lb/>
            better or worse than that which is judged of (for the mind is <note type="footnote"> * Deut. xiii. 6. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Leviticus xvi. 17. </note> <note type="footnote"> † Genesis xv. 5. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="111"/>
            better than the outward sense, and the outward sense is duller <lb/>
            than the intellect; in the same ratio do the subjects of the <lb/>
            judgment differ: so that the objects of the intellect are in­ <lb/>
            finitely superior to those of the outward senses; for the eyes <lb/>
            in the body are the smallest imaginable portion of the eye of <lb/>
            the soul; for the one is like the sun, but the others only re­ <lb/>
            semble lamps, which are at one time lighted and at another <lb/>
            extinguished.</p>
          <p>XVIII. Therefore that is a necessary addition which is sub­ <lb/>
            joined, " Abraham believed in God,"* to the praise of him <lb/>
            who did thus believe. And yet, perhaps, some one may say, <lb/>
            " Do you judge this worthy of praise ? who would not give his <lb/>
            attention to God when saying or promising anything, even if <lb/>
            he were the most wicked and impious of all men ?" To whom <lb/>
            we will reply, " Do not, do not, my good man, without further <lb/>
            inquiry, either rob the wise man of his due praise, or attribute <lb/>
            to unworthy persons that most perfect of the virtues, faith; <lb/>
            and do not blame our opinion on this point; for if you are <lb/>
            willing to enter upon a deeper investigation into this subject, <lb/>
            and are not content with examining it superficially, you will <lb/>
            then see clearly, that without the assistance or addition of <lb/>
            something else, it is not easy to believe in God on account of <lb/>
            that connection with mortality in which we are involved, <lb/>
            which compels us to put some trust in money, and glory, and <lb/>
            authority, and friends, and health, and vigour of body, and <lb/>
            in numerous other things; but to wash off all these extraneous <lb/>
            things, to disbelieve in creation, which is, in all respects, un­ <lb/>
            trustworthy as far as regards itself, and to believe in the only <lb/>
            true and faithful God, is the work of a great and heavenly <lb/>
            mind, which is no longer allured or influenced by any of the <lb/>
            circumstances usually affecting human life.</p>
          <p>XIX. And it is well added in the scripture, " And it was <lb/>
            counted to him for righteousness :" for nothing is so righteous <lb/>
            as to have an unalloyed and entire belief in the only God.</p>
          <p>But this, although both just and consistent with reason, <lb/>
            was considered an incredible thing on account of the incredu­ <lb/>
            lity of the generality of men, whom the holy scripture con <lb/>
            demns, saying, that “ to anchor firmly and unchangeably on <lb/>
            the only living God, is a thing to be admired among men, <lb/>
            who have no possession of true unmingled good, but is not to <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xv. 6. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="112"/>
            be wondered at if truth guide the judgment; but it is the <lb/>
            especial attribute of justice.</p>
          <p>XX. The scripture proceeds: " And he said unto him I am <lb/>
            God, who brought thee out of the land of the Chaldæans, so <lb/>
            as to give thee this land to inherit it." These words exhibit <lb/>
            not only a promise, but a confirmation of an ancient promise ; <lb/>
            for the good which was previously bestowed upon him was the <lb/>
            departure from the Chaldæan philosophy, which was occupied <lb/>
            about the things of the air, which taught men to suppose that <lb/>
            the world was not the work of God, but was God himself; <lb/>
            and that good and evil is caused in the case of all existing <lb/>
            things, by the motions and fixed periodical revolutions of the <lb/>
            stars, and that on these motions the origin of all good and evil <lb/>
            depends; and the equable (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ὁμαλὴ</foreign>) and regular motion of <lb/>
            these bodies in heaven, persuaded those simple men to look <lb/>
            upon these things as omens, for the name of the Chaldæans <lb/>
            being interpreted is synonymous with equability (<foreign xml:lang="grc">όμαλότης</foreign>). <lb/>
            But the new blessing which is promised is the acquisition of <lb/>
            that wisdom which is not taught by the outward senses, but is <lb/>
            comprehended by the pure mind, and by which the best of all <lb/>
            emigrations is confirmed; when the soul departs from astro­ <lb/>
            nomy and learns to apply itself to natural philosophy, and to <lb/>
            exchange unsure conjecture for certain apprehension, and, to <lb/>
            speak with real truth, to quit the creature for the Creator, and <lb/>
            the world for its father and maker; for the scriptures tell us, <lb/>
            that the votaries of the Chaldæan philosophy believed in the <lb/>
            heaven, but that he who abandoned that sect believed in the <lb/>
            ruler of the heaven and the manager of the whole world, <lb/>
            namely, in God. A very beautiful inheritance, greater per­ <lb/>
            haps than the power of him who receives it, but worthy of the <lb/>
            greatness of the giver.</p>
          <p>XXI. But it is not sufficient for the lover of wisdom to <lb/>
            have a hope of good things, and to expect all kinds of ad­ <lb/>
            mirable things, because of the predictions given to him, but <lb/>
            unless he also knows the manner in which he is to arrive at <lb/>
            the succession of his inheritance, he thinks it very grievous, <lb/>
            inasmuch as he thirsts after knowledge, and has an insatiable <lb/>
            desire of attaining to it; on which account he puts a question, <lb/>
            saying, " 0 Lord God, how shall I know that I shall inherit <lb/>
            it?" Perhaps some one may say that this question is at <lb/>
            variance with perfect faith, for that to feel such a difficulty is <lb/>
             <pb n="113"/>
            the part of one who doubts, but that it is the part of one who <lb/>
            believes to seek for nothing further. We must say, therefore, <lb/>
            that he both doubts and has believed, but not about the same <lb/>
            matter, far from it, for he has believed that he is to be an in­ <lb/>
            heritor of wisdom, but he only seeks to know the manner in <lb/>
            which this event will take place ; that it really will take place <lb/>
            he does by all means confidently comprehend, in accordance <lb/>
            with the divine promises.</p>
          <p>Therefore the teacher having praised the desire for learn­ <lb/>
            ing which he feels, begins his explanation with the first <lb/>
            elementary instruction, in which this is set down as the first <lb/>
            and most necessary thing, " Take for me." * The sentence is <lb/>
            brief, but the meaning is great; for there are not a few things <lb/>
            implied in these words. In the first place you have, says God, <lb/>
            no goed thing of your own, but whatever you fancy that you <lb/>
            have, another has bestowed it upon you. From which it is <lb/>
            inferred that all things are the property of God who gives <lb/>
            them, but that they do not belong to the creature which only <lb/>
            existed after him, and which stretches forth its hands to take <lb/>
            them. In the second place, he says, even if you take them, <lb/>
            take them not for yourself, but think what is thus given you a <lb/>
            loan or deposit, and be ready to restore it to him who has de­ <lb/>
            posited it with, or contributed it to you, requiting an older <lb/>
            favour with a newer one, and an original kindness with one <lb/>
            proffered instead of it, as justice and propriety require.</p>
          <p>XXII. For many men have become wicked in respect of <lb/>
            such sacred deposits, having, through their immoderate covet­ <lb/>
            ousness improperly used the property of others as their own. <lb/>
            But do thou, 0 good man! endeavour with all thy strength, <lb/>
            not only to present what you have received without injury and <lb/>
            without adulteration, but also to take even more care than that <lb/>
            of such things, that he who has deposited them with you may <lb/>
            have no grounds to blame the care which has been exercised <lb/>
            by you. And what the Creator of man has deposited in your <lb/>
            custody are soul, speech, and external sense; which are sym­ <lb/>
            bolically named a heifer, a raid, and a goat, in the sacred scrip­ <lb/>
            tures. But these things some persons have at once appropriated <lb/>
            through self-love, but others have stored them up so as to be <lb/>
            able to return them in due season. Now, of those who have <lb/>
            appropriated them, it is impossible to tell the number; for <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xv. 9. </note> <note type="footnote"> VOL. II. </note> <note type="footnote"> I </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="114"/>
            who of us is there who does not think his soul, and his speech, <lb/>
            and his external senses, all taken together, to be his own pro­ <lb/>
            perty, thinking that to feel, and to speak, and to comprehend, <lb/>
            depend upon himself alone ? But of those who really preserve <lb/>
            their faith holy and inviolate, the number is very small.</p>
          <p>Such men attribute to God these three things: the soul, <lb/>
            the external sense, and speech. For they have received all <lb/>
            these things, not for themselves, but for him, in whose favour <lb/>
            they naturally and appropriately confess that the energies ac­ <lb/>
            cording to each of these three things depend upon him, namely, <lb/>
            the imaginations and apprehensions of the mind, the explana­ <lb/>
            tions of speech, and the perceptions of the outward senses. <lb/>
            Those, now, who attribute these things to themselves, have <lb/>
            received an allotment worthy of their own perverseness, namely, <lb/>
            a soul fond of plotting against others, polluted with irrational <lb/>
            passions, and enveloped in a multitude of vices; at one time <lb/>
            eager to indulge in violent insolence through its gluttony and <lb/>
            lasciviousness, as though it were in a brothel; at another time <lb/>
            held fast by the multitude of its iniquities as in a prison, with <lb/>
            wicked (not men but) actions which deserve to be led before <lb/>
            all the judges. Secondly, speech insolent, loquacious, sharp­ <lb/>
            ened against the truth injurious to an who come in its way, <lb/>
            and bringing disgrace upon those who possess it. Thirdly, the <lb/>
            external sense, insatiable, always filling itself with the objects <lb/>
            of the outward senses, but through its immoderate appetites <lb/>
            never able to be satisfied, disregarding all its monitors and cor­ <lb/>
            rectors, so as to refuse to look upon or to listen to them, and <lb/>
            to reject with disdain all that they say to it for its good. But <lb/>
            those who take these things not for themselves but for God, <lb/>
            attribute each one of them to him, guarding that which they <lb/>
            have acquired in a truly holy and religious manner, keeping <lb/>
            their mind, so that it shall think of nothing else but the things <lb/>
            relating to God and to his excellencies, and their speech so as <lb/>
            to make it, with unrestrained mouth, and with encomiums, and <lb/>
            hymns, and announcements of happiness, honour the father of <lb/>
            the universe, collecting together and exhibiting all its powers of <lb/>
            interpretation and utterance in this one office ; and regulating <lb/>
            the external senses, so that forming a conception of the whole <lb/>
            of that world which is perceptible by them, they may, in a <lb/>
            guileless, honest, and pure manner, relate to the soul all the <lb/>
            heaven and earth, and the natures whose home is between the <lb/>
             <pb n="115"/>
            two, and all animals and plants, and their respective energies and <lb/>
            faculties, and all their motions and their stationary existence.</p>
          <p>For God has implanted in the mind a power of comprehend­ <lb/>
            ing that world, which is appreciable only by the intellect, by <lb/>
            its own power, but the invisible world by means of the external <lb/>
            senses. And if any one were able in all his parts to live to <lb/>
            God rather than to himself, looking by means of the external <lb/>
            senses into those things which are their proper objects, for the <lb/>
            sake of finding out the truth; and through the medium of the <lb/>
            soul, investigating in a philosophical spirit the proper objects of <lb/>
            intelligence, and those things which have a real existence, and <lb/>
            by means of his organs of voice, singing hymns in praise of the <lb/>
            world and of its Creator, he will have a happy and a blessed life.</p>
          <p>XXIII. I think then that this is what intimated in the <lb/>
            words, " Take for me; " God, intending to send down the per­ <lb/>
            fection of his divine virtue from heaven to earth, out of pity <lb/>
            for our race, in order that it might not be left destitute of a <lb/>
            better portion, prepared in a symbolical manner the sacred <lb/>
            tabernacle and the things in it, a thing made after the model <lb/>
            and in imitation of wisdom. For he says that he has erected <lb/>
            his oracle as a tabernacle in the midst of our impurity, in order <lb/>
            that we may have something whereby we may be purified, <lb/>
            washing off and cleansing all those things which dirt and <lb/>
            defile our miserable life, full of all evil reputation as it is.</p>
          <p>Let us now then see in what manner he has commanded us <lb/>
            to bring in the different things which are to contribute to the <lb/>
            furnishing of the tabernacle. “ The Lord, " says the scripture, <lb/>
            " spake unto Moses saying, Speak unto the children of Israel, <lb/>
            and take ye first-fruits for me of whatever it shall seem good <lb/>
            to your heart to take my first-fruits.”* Therefore here also <lb/>
            there is an injunction to take not for themselves but for God, <lb/>
            examining who it is who gives these things, and doing no <lb/>
            injury to what is given, but preserving it free from danger, and <lb/>
            free from spot, perfect and entire. And the injunction, by <lb/>
            which he orders the first fruits to be offered to himself, is full <lb/>
            of doctrine; for in real truth the beginnings both of bodies <lb/>
            and of things are investigated with reference to God alone; <lb/>
            and search if you wish to understand everything, plants and <lb/>
            animals, and arts and sciences.</p>
          <p>Are then the first castings of the seed of plants, the actions <note type="footnote"> * Exodus xxv. 1. </note> <note type="footnote"> I 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="116"/>
            of husbandry or the invisible works of invisible nature? What <lb/>
            more need I ask ? What are the works of men and other <lb/>
            animals ? Have not they parents as co-operating causes, as it <lb/>
            were, and also nature as the primary and more important and <lb/>
            real cause ? And is not nature the fountain, and root, and <lb/>
            foundation of all arts and sciences, or any other name you <lb/>
            please to give to the oldest of principles, nature, upon which <lb/>
            all speculations are built up ? And if nature be not first laid as <lb/>
            the foundation, everything is imperfect, and on this account <lb/>
            some one seems to me to have said with great felicity :— <lb/>
            The first beginning is quite half the whole.</p>
          <p>XXIV. Very appropriately therefore does the sacred scrip­ <lb/>
            ture command the first-fruits to be offered up to the all-ruling <lb/>
            God. And in another passage we read “The Lord spake unto <lb/>
            Moses saying, Sanctify to me all the-first born : all that is <lb/>
            first brought forth, all that openeth the womb among the <lb/>
            children of Israel, whether of man or beast is mine,"* so that <lb/>
            it is openly asserted in these words, that all the first things, <lb/>
            whether in point of time or of power, are the property of God, <lb/>
            and most especially all the first-born; since the whole of that <lb/>
            race which is imperishable shall justly be apportioned to the <lb/>
            immortal God ; and if there is anything, in short, which openeth <lb/>
            the womb, whether of man which here means speech and reason, <lb/>
            or of beast which signifies the outward sense and the body; <lb/>
            for that which openeth the womb of all these things, whether <lb/>
            of the mind, so as to enable it to comprehend the things <lb/>
            appreciable only by the intellect, or of the speech so as to <lb/>
            enable it to exercise the energies of voice, or of the external <lb/>
            senses, so as to qualify them to receive the impressions which <lb/>
            are made upon them by their appropriate subjects, or of the <lb/>
            body to fit it for its appropriate stationary conditions or <lb/>
            motions, is the invisible, spermatic, technical, and divine Word, <lb/>
            which shall most properly be dedicated to the Fathey.</p>
          <p>And, indeed, as are the beginnings of God so likewise are <lb/>
            the ends of God; and Moses is a witness to this, where he <lb/>
            commands to " separate off the end, and to confess that it is <lb/>
            due to God."t The things in the world do also bear witness. <note type="footnote"> * Exodus xiii. 2. </note><note type="footnote"> t There is probably some corruption here. The marginal reference </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="117"/>
            How so? The beginning of a plant is the seed, and the end <lb/>
            is the fruit, each of them being the work, not of husbandry, <lb/>
            but of nature. Again, of knowledge the beginning is nature, <lb/>
            as has been shown, but the end can never reach mankind, for <lb/>
            no man is perfect in any branch of study whatever; but it is a <lb/>
            plain truth, that all excellence and perfection belong to one <lb/>
            Being alone; we therefore are borne on, for the future, on the <lb/>
            confines of beginning and end, learning, teaching, tilling the <lb/>
            ground, working up everything else, as if we were really effect­ <lb/>
            ing something, that the creature also may seem to be doing <lb/>
            something; therefore, with a more perfect knowledge, Moses <lb/>
            has confessed that the first-fruits and the end belong to God, <lb/>
            speaking of the creation of the world, where he says, “ In the <lb/>
            beginning God evented ... And again he says, " God <lb/>
            finished the heaven and the earth." Now therefore he says, <lb/>
            " Take for me," assigning himself wlat becomes him, and <lb/>
            admonishing his hearer not to adulcerate what is given to him, <lb/>
            but to take care of it in a manner worthy of its importance. <lb/>
            And again, in another passage, he who has need of nothing, <lb/>
            and who on this account takes nothing, will confess that he <lb/>
            docs take something, for the sake of giving to his worshippers <lb/>
            the feeling of piety, and of implanting in them an eagerness <lb/>
            after holiness, and moreover sharpening their zeal in his ser­ <lb/>
            vice, as one who favourably receives the genuine worship and <lb/>
            service of a willing soul, “ For behold," says he, " I have <lb/>
            taken the Levites instead of all the first-born that openeth the <lb/>
            -womb among the children of Israel; they shall be their ran­ <lb/>
            som;”† therefore we take and give, but we are said to take <lb/>
            with strict accuracy, but it is only by a metaphorical abuse of <lb/>
            the term that we are said to give, for the reasons which I have <lb/>
            already mentioned. And it is very felicitously that he has <lb/>
            called the Levites a ransom, for nothing so completely con­ <lb/>
            ducts the mind to freedom as its fleeing for refuge to and <lb/>
            becoming a suppliant of God ; and this is what the consecrated <lb/>
            tribe of the Levites particularly professes to be.</p>
          <p>XXV. Having now, therefore, said as much as is proper on <lb/>
            these subjects, let us proceed onwards to what comes next ; <lb/>
            for we have postponed the consideration of many things which <note type="footnote">is to Numbers xxi. 41, and there are only thirty-five verses in the <lb/>
            chapter. The same thing has occurred in one or two previous instances. </note> <note type="footnote"> * Genesis i. 1. </note> <note type="footnote"> † Num. iii. 12. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="118"/>
            ought to be examined into with exactness. " Take for me,' <lb/>
            says God, " a heifer which has never been yoked and has <lb/>
            never been ill-treated, tender and young,”* and exulting; <lb/>
            that is to say, a soul adapted easily to receive government, and <lb/>
            instruction, and superintendence. “ Take for me also a ram," <lb/>
            that is to say, speech contentious and perfect, capable of dis­ <lb/>
            secting and overthrowing the sophistries of those who advance <lb/>
            contrary opinions, and capable also of ensuring safety, and <lb/>
            good order, and regularity to him who uses it. “ Take for <lb/>
            me," also the external sense, which lives and directs all its <lb/>
            energies to the world, which is perceptible by it, that is, "a <lb/>
            goat," three complete years old, enjoying solid strength in a <lb/>
            perfect number, having beginning, middle, and end. Besides <lb/>
            all these things, “ a turtle dove and a pigeon," that is to say, <lb/>
            divine and human wisdom, both of them being winged, and <lb/>
            being animals accustomed to soar on high, still different from <lb/>
            one another, as much as genus differs from species or a copy <lb/>
            from the model; for divine wisdom is fond of lonely places, <lb/>
            loving solitude, on account of the only God, whose possession <lb/>
            she is; and this is called a turtle-dove, symbolically; but the <lb/>
            other is quiet and tame, and gregarious, haunting the cities of <lb/>
            men, and rejoicing in its abode among mortals, and so they <lb/>
            liken her to a pigeon.</p>
          <p>XXVI. Moses appears to me to have intended figuratively <lb/>
            to represent these virtues when he calls the midwives of the <lb/>
            Egyptians, Shiphrah and Puah,† for the name Shiphrah, being <lb/>
            interpreted, means " a little bird," and Puah means " red." <lb/>
            Now it is the especial property of divine wisdom, like a bird, <lb/>
            to be always soaring on high; but it is the characteristic of <lb/>
            human wisdom to study modesty and temperance, so as to <lb/>
            blush at all objects which are worthy to cause a blush; and as <lb/>
            a very manifest proof of this the scripture says, " He took for <lb/>
            himself all these things.”‡ This is the praise of a virtuous <lb/>
            man, who preserves the sacred deposit of those things which <lb/>
            he has received, the soul, the outward sense, speech, divine <lb/>
            wisdom, human knowledge, in a pure and guileless manner, <lb/>
            not for himself, but only for him who has trusted him. After <lb/>
            this the scripture proceeds to say, " And he divided them in <lb/>
            the middle," not explaining who did so, in order that you may <lb/>
            understand that it was the untaught God who divided them, <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xv. 9. </note> <note type="footnote"> † Exodus i. 15. </note> <note type="footnote">‡ Genesis xv. 10 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="119"/>
            and that he divided all the natures of bodies and of things one <lb/>
            after another, which appeared to be closely fitted together and <lb/>
            united by his word, which cuts through everything; which <lb/>
            being sharpened to the finest possible edge, never ceases <lb/>
            dividing all the objects of the outward senses, and when it has <lb/>
            gone through them all, and arrived at the things which are <lb/>
            called atoms and indivisible, then again this divider begins <lb/>
            from them to divide those things which may be contemplated <lb/>
            by the speculations of reason into unspeakable and indescriba­ <lb/>
            ble portions, and to " beat the gold into thin plates,”* like <lb/>
            hairs, as Moses says, making them into one length without <lb/>
            breadth, like unsubstantial lines. Each therefore of the three <lb/>
            victims he divided in the midst, dividing the soul into the ra­ <lb/>
            tional and the irrational part, speech into truth and falsehood, <lb/>
            and the outward sense into imaginations which can be and <lb/>
            which cannot be comprehended ; and these divisions lie im­ <lb/>
            mediately places exactly opposite to one another, that is, the <lb/>
            rational part opposite to the irrational, truth to falsehood, what <lb/>
            is comprehensible to what is incomprehensible, leaving the <lb/>
            birds undivided; for it was impossible to divide the incorporeal <lb/>
            and divine sciences into contrarieties at variance with one <lb/>
            another.</p>
          <p>XXVII. But as the discussion on the subject of a division <lb/>
            into equal portions, and on that of opposite contrarieties, is of <lb/>
            great extent' and of necessary importance, we will not wholly <lb/>
            pass it by. nor will we dwell on it with prolixity, but, investi­ <lb/>
            gating it as it is, we will be content with such things as seem <lb/>
            suitable to the occasion.</p>
          <p>For as the Creator divided our soul and our limbs in <lb/>
            the middle, so also, in the same manner, did he divide <lb/>
            the essence of the universe when he made the world; for, <lb/>
            having taken it, he began to divide it thus : in the first <lb/>
            instance, he made two divisions, the heavy and the light, <lb/>
            separating that which was thick from that which was <lb/>
            more subtle. After that, he again made a second division of <lb/>
            each, dividing the subtle part into air and fire, and the denser <lb/>
            portion into water and earth; and, first of all, he laid down <lb/>
            those elements, which are perceptible by the outward senses, <lb/>
            to be, as it were, the foundations of the world which is percep­ <lb/>
            tible by the outward senses. Again, he subdivided heavy and <note type="footnote"> * Exodus xxxix. 3. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="120"/>
            light according to other ideas, for he divided the light into <lb/>
            cold and hot; and the cold he called air, and that which was <lb/>
            hot by nature he called fire. The heavy, again, he divided <lb/>
            into wet and dry ; and the dry he called land, and the wet he <lb/>
            called water-and each of these, again, received other further <lb/>
            subdivisions ; for the land was divided into continents and <lb/>
            islands, and the water into sea and rivers, and all drinkable <lb/>
            springs, and the air was divided into the solstices of summer <lb/>
            and winter; fire, also, was divided into what is useful (but fire <lb/>
            is a most insatiable and destructive thing), and also by a dii­ <lb/>
            ferent division into what is saving; and this division was <lb/>
            assigned for the conformation of the heaven.</p>
          <p>But as he divided the things when entire, so also did he <lb/>
            divide the particular divisions, some of which were animated <lb/>
            and others inanimate; and of those which were inanimate he <lb/>
            made a division into those which always remain in the same <lb/>
            place, the bond of which is habit, and those which move, not <lb/>
            indeed in the way of changing their place, but so as to grow, <lb/>
            which indescribable nature has vivified. Again of these, those <lb/>
            which are of wild materials are productive of wild fruits, which <lb/>
            are the food of brute beasts; but others producing good fruit, <lb/>
            the cultivation of which has called forth diligent superin­ <lb/>
            tendence and care, and these produce fruit for the tamest of <lb/>
            all animals, namely, for man, that he may enjoy them. And <lb/>
            not only did he divide the inanimate things, and those which <lb/>
            had received a soul and vitality in one manner-for of these <lb/>
            he defined one species as that of irrational, and one as that of <lb/>
            rational animals-but he also again subdivided each of these <lb/>
            things, dividing the irrational into the wild and the tame <lb/>
            species, and the rational into the mortal and the immortal. <lb/>
            Again, of the mortal he made two divisions, one of which he <lb/>
            called men, and the other women ; and, in the same manner, <lb/>
            he divided the irrational animals into male and female.</p>
          <p>And these things were also subjected to other necessary <lb/>
            divisions, which made distinctions between them; winged <lb/>
            animals being distinguished from terrestrial, terrestrial from <lb/>
            aquatic creatures, and aquatic creatures, again, from both <lb/>
            extremities. Thus God, having sharpened his own word, the <lb/>
            divider of all things, divides the essence of the universe which <lb/>
            is destitute of form, and destitute of all distinctive qualities, <lb/>
            and the four elements of the world which were separated from <lb/>
             <pb n="121"/>
            this essence, and the plants and animals which were consoli­ <lb/>
            dated by means of these elements.</p>
          <p>XXVIII. But since Moses not only uses the expression, <lb/>
            “ he divided," but says further, " he divided in the midst," it is <lb/>
            necessary to say a few words on the subject of equal divisions ; <lb/>
            for that which is divided skilfully just in the middle makes <lb/>
            two equal divisions. And no man could ever possibly divide <lb/>
            anything into two exactly equal parts ; but it is inevitable that <lb/>
            one of the divisions must fall a little short, or exceed a little, <lb/>
            if not much, at all events by a small quantity, in every <lb/>
            instance, which indeed escapes the perception of our outward <lb/>
            senses which attend only to the larger and more tangible <lb/>
            burdens of nature and custom, but which are unable to com­ <lb/>
            prehend atoms and indivisible things. But it is established <lb/>
            by the incorruptible word of truth that there is nothing equal <lb/>
            in inequality.</p>
          <p>God alone therefore seems to be exactly just, and to be the <lb/>
            only being able to divide in the middle bodies and things, in <lb/>
            such a manner that none of the divisions shall be greater or <lb/>
            less than the other by the smallest and most indivisible <lb/>
            portion, and he alone is able to attain to sublime and perfect <lb/>
            equality.</p>
          <p>If therefore there were but one idea of perfect equality, <lb/>
            what has been said would be quite sufficient for the purpose. <lb/>
            But as there are many, we must not hesitate to add some <lb/>
            considerations which are suitable. For the word " equal " is <lb/>
            used in one sense when speaking of numbers, as when we say <lb/>
            that two are equal to two, and three to three; and speak of <lb/>
            other numbers in the same manner. But in another sense <lb/>
            when speaking of magnitude, as equal in length or breadth, or <lb/>
            depth, which are all different proportions. For wrestler <lb/>
            compared with wrestler, or cubit with cubit are equal in <lb/>
            magnitude but different in power, as is the case also with <lb/>
            measures and weights. But the idea of equality is a neces­ <lb/>
            sary one, and so is that of equality in proportion, according <lb/>
            to which a few things are looked upon as equal to many, and <lb/>
            small things are equal to larger ones. And their proportion­ <lb/>
            ate equality, cities are accustomed to use at suitable times, <lb/>
            when they command every citizen to contribute an equal <lb/>
            share of his property, not equal in number, but in proportion <lb/>
            to the value of his assessment, so that in some cases he who <lb/>
             <pb n="122"/>
            contributes a hundred drachms will appear to have brought <lb/>
            an equal sum with him who contributes a talent.</p>
          <p>XXIX. These things being thus previously sketched out, <lb/>
            see now how God, dividing things in the middle, has divided <lb/>
            them into equal portions according to all the ideas of equality <lb/>
            which occur in the creation of the universe. He has divided <lb/>
            the heavy things so as to make them equal in number to the <lb/>
            light ones, two to two; that is to say, so that the earth and the <lb/>
            water, being things of weight, are equal in number to those <lb/>
            which are by nature light, air and fire. Again, he has made <lb/>
            one equal to one, the driest thing to the wettest thing, the earth <lb/>
            to the water; and the coldest thing to the hottest thing, the <lb/>
            air to the fire, So, in the same manner, he has divided light <lb/>
            from darkness, and day from night, and summer from winter, <lb/>
            and autumn from spring; and so on.</p>
          <p>Again, he has divided things so as to make his divisions <lb/>
            equal in point of magnitude; such as the parallel cycles in <lb/>
            heaven, and those which belong to the equinoxes both of <lb/>
            spring and autumn, and those which belong to the winter and <lb/>
            summer solstice. And on the earth he has divided the zones, <lb/>
            two being equal to one another, which being placed close to <lb/>
            the poles are frozen with cold, and on this account are <lb/>
            uninhabitable. And two he has placed on the borders <lb/>
            between these two and the torrid zone, and these two they <lb/>
            say are the abode of a happy temperature of the air, one of <lb/>
            them lying towards the south and the other towards the north.</p>
          <p>Now the divisions of time are equal in point of length, the <lb/>
            longest day being equal to the longest night, and again the <lb/>
            shortest day being equal to the shortest night, and the mean <lb/>
            length of day to the mean length of night. And the equal <lb/>
            magnitude of other days and nights appears to be indicated <lb/>
            chiefly by the equinoxes. From the spring equinox to the <lb/>
            summer solstice, day receives an addition to its length, and <lb/>
            night, on the other hand, submits to a diminution; until the <lb/>
            longest day and the shortest night are both completed. And <lb/>
            then after the summer solstice the sun, turning back again the <lb/>
            same road, neither more quickly nor more slowly than he <lb/>
            advanced, but always preserving the same difference in the <lb/>
            same manner, having a constantly equal arrangement, <lb/>
            proceeds on till the autumnal equinox ; and then, having made <lb/>
            day and night both equal, it begins to increase the length of <lb/>
             <pb n="123"/>
            the night, diminishing the day until the time of the winter <lb/>
            solstice. And when it has made the night the longest night, <lb/>
            and the day the shortest day, then returning back again and <lb/>
            adopting the same distances as before, he again comes to the <lb/>
            spring equinox.</p>
          <p>Thus the differences of time which appear to be unequal, <lb/>
            do in reality possess a perfect equality in respect of magnitude, <lb/>
            not indeed at the same seasons, but at different seasons of <lb/>
            the year.</p>
          <p>XXX. And a very similar effect is seen in the different <lb/>
            parts of animals and especially of men. For hand is equal to <lb/>
            hand, and foot to foot, and nearly all the other limbs of the <lb/>
            body are equal to their corresponding members in magnitude, <lb/>
            those on the left hand being equal to those on the right. <lb/>
            And there are an exceeding number of things which are equal <lb/>
            to one another in power, both among wet things and dry <lb/>
            things, the judgment on which is seen in measures and <lb/>
            scales, and things of that kind. And nearly all things are <lb/>
            equal as respects proportion, even all the little and all the <lb/>
            great things in the whole world. For those who have <lb/>
            examined the questions of natural philosophy with some <lb/>
            accuracy say that the four elements are all equal in propor­ <lb/>
            tionate equality. And it is by proportion that the whole <lb/>
            world is compounded together, and united, and endowed with <lb/>
            consistency so as to remain firm for ever, proportion having <lb/>
            distributed equality to each of its parts. And they say also that <lb/>
            the four elements which are in us, dryness, and moisture, and <lb/>
            cold, and heat have all been mixed together and well adapted <lb/>
            by proportionate equality, and in fact that our whole composi­ <lb/>
            tion is nothing but a mixture of the four powers combined <lb/>
            together by an equality of proportion.</p>
          <p>XXXI. But any one who examines all these things might <lb/>
            add an interminable list of arguments and instances to this <lb/>
            one present discussion. If he considered he would find the <lb/>
            very smallest animals equal to the largest as to proportion; as <lb/>
            for instance he would find the swallow equal to the eagle, the <lb/>
            herring equal to the whale, and the ant equal to the elephant. <lb/>
            For body and soul, and again pains and pleasures, and more­ <lb/>
            over affection for and dislike towards things, and all the <lb/>
            other feelings which the nature of animals experience, are <lb/>
            nearly all of them similar, being made equal by the rule of <lb/>
             <pb n="124"/>
            proportion. Thus some men have felt confidence even to <lb/>
            declare that the smallest of animals, man, is equal to the <lb/>
            whole world, considering that each of them consists of a body <lb/>
            and a rational soul, so that, using a figurative expression, they <lb/>
            have called man a little world, and the world a large man. <lb/>
            And in teaching this they are not very wide of the mark, but <lb/>
            they know that the art of God according to which he created <lb/>
            all things, admitting neither any extraordinary intensity nor <lb/>
            any relaxation ; but always remaining the same, made every <lb/>
            single existing thing perfectly, according to its own excessive <lb/>
            and consummate perfection, the Creator employing all numbers <lb/>
            and all the ideas which tend to perfection.</p>
          <p>XXXII. For, as Moses says, " He judged according to the <lb/>
            little and according to the great,"* engendering and fashioning <lb/>
            everything, and not taking anything away from the display of <lb/>
            his art by reason of the obscurity of his materials, not adding <lb/>
            anything because of their brilliancy ; since all the artists who <lb/>
            have any reputation wish to work up whatever materials they <lb/>
            take in an admirable manner, whether they are costly or <lb/>
            whether they are inexpensive. And before now, some persons, <lb/>
            having even an extraordinary love of distinction, have even <lb/>
            spent more skill in working up materials of little value, than <lb/>
            they have devoted to those which are costly, wishing to make <lb/>
            up for the deficiencies of the material by the additional <lb/>
            display of their skill. But there is no material which has any <lb/>
            value in the eyes of God, because he has given all materials <lb/>
            an equal share of his skill. In reference to which it is said <lb/>
            in the sacred scriptures, " God saw all that he had made, and, <lb/>
            behold, it was very good."t But the things which receive an <lb/>
            equal degree of praise, are by all means held in equal estima­ <lb/>
            tion by him who confers the praise ; and what God praised <lb/>
            was not the materials which he had worked up into creation, <lb/>
            destitute of life and of melody, and easily dissolved, and <lb/>
            moreover in their own intrinsic nature perishable, and out of <lb/>
            all proportion and full of iniquity, but rather his own skilful <lb/>
            work, completed according to one equal and well-proportioned <lb/>
            power and knowledge always alike and identical. In reference <lb/>
            to which all things were also accounted equal and similar by <lb/>
            all the rules of proportion, according to the principles of art <lb/>
            and knowledge. <note type="footnote"> * Deuteronomy L 17. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Genesis i. 31. </note> <pb n="125"/>
            </p>
          <p>XXXIII. And if there is any one in the world who is a <lb/>
            praiser of equality, that man is Moses. In the first place <lb/>
            composing hymns in its honour, and in every place, and calling <lb/>
            it the especial property of justice, as in fact its very name to <lb/>
            some degree shows, to divide* bodies and things into two <lb/>
            equal parts; and in the second place blaming injustice, the <lb/>
            worker of the most disgraceful inequality ; and inequality has <lb/>
            been the parent of two wars, foreign and civil war, as on the <lb/>
            other hand equality is the parent of peace. And he also utters <lb/>
            the most manifest panegyric on justice, and the most unde­ <lb/>
            niable reproach of injustice when he says, " You shall not <lb/>
            commit injustice in any judgment, nor in measures, or weights, <lb/>
            or balances : a just balance, and just weights, and a just heap, <lb/>
            shall be yours. "t And in Deuteronomy he says, " There shall <lb/>
            not be a false weight in thy bag; thy weight shalt be true and <lb/>
            just; there shall not be a little weight and a large one ; that <lb/>
            thy days may be multiplied upon the earth, which the Lord <lb/>
            thy God giveth thee for an inheritance, because every one who <lb/>
            committeth injustice is an abomination to the Lord.” ‡</p>
          <p>Therefore God, who loveth justice, hates and abominates <lb/>
            injustice, the beginning of sedition and of evils ; and in one <lb/>
            passage the lawgiver represents equality as the muse of justice <lb/>
            beginning with the creation of the entire heaven. For he <lb/>
            says, " And God made a separation between the light and <lb/>
            between the darkness, and he called the light day, and the dark­ <lb/>
            ness he called night.”§ For it is equality which allotted night <lb/>
            and day and light and darkness to existing things. It is <lb/>
            equality also that divided the human race into man and woman, <lb/>
            making two divisions, unequal in strength, but most perfectly <lb/>
            equal for the purpose which nature had principally in view, the <lb/>
            generation of a third human being like themselves. For, says <lb/>
            Moses, “ God made man; in the image of God created he him; <lb/>
            male and female created lie them. || He no longer says "him," <lb/>
            but " them" in the plural number, adapting the species to the <lb/>
            genus, which have, as I have already said, been divided with <lb/>
            perfect equality.</p>
          <p>XXXIV. And he apportioned cold and heat, and summer <note type="footnote"> * The Greek is <foreign xml:lang="grc">δίχα τέμνειν</foreign>, as if <foreign xml:lang="grc">δικαιοσύνη</foreign>, "justice," were <lb/>

            and spring, the different seasons of the year, divided by the <lb/>
            same dividing Word. And the three days which passed <lb/>
            before the creation of the sun, are equal in number to the <lb/>
            three days of the first week which came after the creation of <lb/>
            the sun, the number six being dissected equally in order to <lb/>
            display the character of eternity and of time. For thus God <lb/>
            allotted three days to eternity before the appearance of the <lb/>
            sun, and those which came after the sun he allotted to time; <lb/>
            the sun being an imitation of eternity, and time and eternity <lb/>
            being the two primary powers of the living God ; the one his <lb/>
            beneficent power, in accordance with which he made the <lb/>
            world, and in respect of which he is called God; the other his <lb/>
            chastening power, according to which he rules and governs <lb/>
            what he has created, in respect of which he is further denomi­ <lb/>
            nated Lord, and these two he here states to be divided in the <lb/>
            middle by him standing above them both. " For," says he, <lb/>
            " I will speak to you from above the mercy-seat, in the midst, <lb/>
            between the two cherubims; ' * that he might show that the most <lb/>
            ancient powers of the living God are equal; that is to say, his <lb/>
            beneficent and his chastising power, being both divided by the <lb/>
            same dividing Word.</p>
          <p>XXXY. But what are the pillars of the ten generic laws <lb/>
            which he calls tables ? They are two; equal in number to <lb/>
            the parts of the soul, the rational and irrational part, which <lb/>
            must be instructed and corrected, being again divided by the <lb/>
            Lawgiver; "for the tables were the work of God, and the <lb/>
            writing was the writing of God engraven on the tables."t <lb/>
            And, indeed, of the ten commandments engraved on these <lb/>
            tables which are properly and especially laws, there is an <lb/>
            equal division into two numbers of five ; the first of which con­ <lb/>
            tains the principle of justice relating to God, and the second <lb/>
            those relating to man.</p>
          <p>Now of those principles of justice relating to God, the first <lb/>
            law enunciated is one which opposes the polytheistic doctrine, <lb/>
            and teaches us that the world is ruled over by one sole gover­ <lb/>
            nor. The second is one forbidding men to make gods of <lb/>
            things which are not the causes of anything, by means of the <lb/>
            treacherous arts of painters and sculptors, whom Moses <lb/>
            banished from his own constitution which he proposed to <lb/>
            establish, condemning them to everlasting banishment, in <note type="footnote"> * Exodus xxv. 22. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Exodus xxxii. 16. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="127"/>
            order that the only true God might be honoured in truth and <lb/>
            simplicity. The third law is one about the name of the Lord, <lb/>
            not about that name which has not yet reached his creatures; <lb/>
            for that name is unspeakable, but about the name which is <lb/>
            constantly applied to him as displayed in his powers ; for it is <lb/>
            commanded that we shall not take his name in vain. The <lb/>
            fourth commandment is concerning the seventh day, always <lb/>
            virgin, and without any mother, in order that creation, taking <lb/>
            care that it may be always free from labour, may in this way <lb/>
            come to a recollection of him who does everything without <lb/>
            being seen.</p>
          <p>The fifth commandment is about the honour due to parents. <lb/>
            For this also is a sacred command; having reference not to <lb/>
            men, but to him who is the cause of birth and existence to <lb/>
            the universe, in accordance with whom it is that fathers and <lb/>
            mothers appear to generate children ; not generating them <lb/>
            themselves, but only being the instruments of generation in <lb/>
            his hands. And this command is placed, as it were, on the <lb/>
            borders between the two tables of laws relating to God and <lb/>
            those relating to man, and so it bounds the five which con­ <lb/>
            cern piety, and that five also which comprehend a prevention <lb/>
            of injury to one's fellows. Since mortal parents are the boun­ <lb/>
            daries of the immortal powers, which, generating everything <lb/>
            according to nature, have permitted this lowest and mortal <lb/>
            race to imitate their own powers of generation, and so to <lb/>
            propagate its own seed; for God is the beginning of all gene­ <lb/>
            ration, and the mortal species of mankind, being the lowest <lb/>
            and least honoured of all, is the end.</p>
          <p>The other table of five is the prohibition of adultery, of <lb/>
            murder, of theft, of false witness, and of covetousness. These <lb/>
            are generic rules, comprehending nearly all offences whatever, <lb/>
            and to one of these rules each particular and special action is <lb/>
            naturally referrible.</p>
          <p>XXXVI. But you see also that the regularly occurring daily <lb/>
            sacrifices are divided into equal portions ; one portion being the <lb/>
            sacrifice which the priests offer in their own behalf, consisting <lb/>
            of the finest wheat-flour, and the other being that which they <lb/>
            offer on behalf of the whole nation; consisting of two lambs, <lb/>
            which they are especially commanded to offer.* For the law <lb/>
            commands them to offer one half of the sacrifices above­ <note type="footnote"> * Leviticus vi. 20. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="128"/>
            mentioned early in the morning, and the other half at the time <lb/>
            of the evening twilight, in order that God may receive his <lb/>
            proper tribute of thanks for the blessings which are showered <lb/>
            upon all men during the night.</p>
          <p>You see also that the loaves which are placed upon the <lb/>
            sacred table are divided by the twelve into equal parts, so as <lb/>
            to be distributed to each company of six in number, and are so <lb/>
            placed as a memorial of the tribes which are of a corresponding <lb/>
            number; one half of whom, virtue, that is Leah, received as her <lb/>
            share, having become the mother of six leaders of tribes; and <lb/>
            the other half fell to the lot of Rachel's children and those of <lb/>
            the other women.</p>
          <p>You see also that the twelve stones of an emerald upon the <lb/>
            garment which reached down to the priests' feet are divided <lb/>
            equally on the right and on the left side of the garment; on <lb/>
            which, being divided into equal numbers of six, the names <lb/>
            of the twelve patriarchs of the tribes were engraved, being <lb/>
            divine characters engraved on pillars, memorials of divine <lb/>
            natures. What more need I say ? Has he not also, taking <lb/>
            two mountains symbolically to mean two races, and having <lb/>
            again divided them on principles of the equality of proportion, <lb/>
            allotted one to those who bless, and the other to those who <lb/>
            curse ; appointing leaders of tribes over each in order to give <lb/>
            admonitions to those who have need of them, and to show them <lb/>
            that the curses are equal in number to the blessings, and <lb/>
            nearly, if it may be lawful to say so, of equal value? For the <lb/>
            praises of the good and the reproaches of the wicked are of <lb/>
            equal service, since to avoid evil and to choose good are, among <lb/>
            all persons of sound sense, looked upon as one and the same <lb/>
            thing.</p>
          <p>XXXVII. A great impression is made upon me by the <lb/>
            selection and division of the two goats which are brought as an <lb/>
            offering for the purpose of atonement, and which are divided <lb/>
            by an obscure and uncertain principle of division, namely, by <lb/>
            lot. For of two principles, the one which is occupied about <lb/>
            the affairs of divine virtue is consecrated and set apart to be <lb/>
            offered to God; but that which devotes itself to the concerns <lb/>
            of human unhappiness is appropriated to the banished creature, <lb/>
            for the share which that has obtained the sacred scriptures <lb/>
            call the scape-goat, since it is removed from its place, and <lb/>
            pursued and driven away to a great distance from virtue.</p><pb n="129"/>
            
          <p>And, as is the case with respect to good and unadulterated <lb/>
            money, so also, as there are many things in nature, does not <lb/>
            the invisible divider appear to you to divide them into equal <lb/>
            portions, and to distribute the good money which has stood <lb/>
            the test to the lover of instruction, and that which has not <lb/>
            been properly coined, and which is bad, to the man who is <lb/>
            ignorant? for, says Moses, " that which had no mark belonged <lb/>
            to Laban, and that which was marked belonged to Jacob."* <lb/>
            For the soul, being as some ancient writer has said, a waxen <lb/>
            tablet, while it is hard and resisting, repels and refuses the <lb/>
            impressions which are attempted to be stamped upon it; and <lb/>
            remains of necessity undistinguished by any figure. But <lb/>
            when it becomes tractable and yielding in a moderate degree, <lb/>
            it then receives deep impressions, and having taken off the <lb/>
            stamp given by the seal, it preserves accurately the appear­ <lb/>
            ances which are impressed upon it, so that they cannot be <lb/>
            effaced</p>
          <p>XXXVIII. Moreover, the equal division of the sacrifices of <lb/>
            blood is certainly calculated to excite our admiration: which <lb/>
            division the chief priest Moses, having nature for his teacher, <lb/>
            made ; for, says the scripture, " He, taking the half of the <lb/>
            blood, poured it into the bowls; and the other half he poured <lb/>
            out upon the altar.”† In order to show that the sacred genus <lb/>
            of wisdom is of a twofold nature, the one kind being divine, <lb/>
            and the other human : and the divine kind is unmingled and <lb/>
            unadulterated, on which account it sacrifices to the pure, and <lb/>
            unalloyed, and only God existing in unity; but the human <lb/>
            kind is of a mixed and alloyed nature, and therefore dissi­ <lb/>
            pates the unanimity and community of our mixed, and com­ <lb/>
            bined, and compound race, and effects any thing rather than <lb/>
            a proper harmony of either melodies or morals.</p>
          <p>But the unmixed and unadulterated portion of the soul is <lb/>
            the pure mind, which, being inspired by heaven from above, <lb/>
            when it is preserved in a state free from all disease and from <lb/>
            all mishap is very suitably all poured forth and resolved into <lb/>
            the elements of a sacred libation, and so restored in a fitting <lb/>
            manner to God, who inspired it and preserved it free from <lb/>
            any infliction of evil; but the mixed portion is entirely that of <lb/>
            the outward senses, and for this part nature has made suitable <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xxx. 42. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Exodus xxiv. 6. </note> <note type="footnote"> VOL. II. </note> <note type="footnote"> K </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="130"/>
            craters. Now, the craters of the sense of seeing are the eyes, <lb/>
            those of hearing are the ears, those of smelling are the <lb/>
            nostrils, and so on with the appropriate receptacles for each of <lb/>
            the senses. On these craters the sacred word pours a portion <lb/>
            of blood, thinking it right that the irrational part of us should <lb/>
            become endowed with soul and vitality, and should in some <lb/>
            manner become rational; following the guidance of admonition, <lb/>
            and purifying itself from the deceitful alluring powers of the <lb/>
            objects of the outward sense which aim to overcome it.</p>
          <p>Was it not in the same manner that the holy double-drachm <lb/>
            was divided?* That we should purify the half of it, namely, <lb/>
            a drachm, offering it as the ransom for our souls: which the <lb/>
            only free, the only delivering God, when addressed in the <lb/>
            voice of supplication, and sometimes even without any suppli­ <lb/>
            cation, by force delivers from the cruel and bitter despotism of <lb/>
            the passions and iniquities; but the other portion we may <lb/>
            leave to the race which is never free, but which is of a slavish <lb/>
            disposition; of which class was the man who said, " I have <lb/>
            loved my lord ;"f that is to say, the mind which is the <lb/>
            master in me; “ and my wife," that is to say, the outward <lb/>
            sense which is dear to him, and the housekeeper of his pas­ <lb/>
            sions : “ and my children," that is to say, the evils which are <lb/>
            the offspring of them; “ I will not depart free." For it is <lb/>
            quite inevitable that such a description of persons as this must <lb/>
            obtain a lot which is no lot, and that the scapegoat bought with <lb/>
            the double drachm, must be given to them, which is just the <lb/>
            opposite of the drachm and of unity which is offered up to God. <lb/>
            And it is the nature of unity not to be capable of either addi­ <lb/>
            tion or subtraction, inasmuch as it is the image of the only <lb/>
            complete God; for all other things are intrinsically and by <lb/>
            their own nature loose; and if there is any where any thing <lb/>
            consolidated, that has been bound by the word of God, for this <lb/>
            word is glue and a chain, filling all things with its essence <lb/>
            And the word, which connects together and fastens every <lb/>
            thing, is peculiarly full itself of itself, having no need whatever <lb/>
            of any thing beyond.</p>
          <p>XXXIX. Very naturally therefore does Moses say, " He <lb/>
            who is rich will not add anything, and he who is poor will not <lb/>
            diminish anything of the half of the double drachm," ‡ which is, <note type="footnote"> * Exodus xxx. 13. </note> <note type="footnote"> † Exodus xxi. 5. </note> <note type="footnote">‡ Exodus xxx. 15. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="131"/>
            as I have said before, a drachm, and a unit; to which every <lb/>
            member might quote that line of the poet: <lb/>
            With thee I'll end, with thee I will begin.</p>
          <p>For even an infinitely infinite number, being made of a con­ <lb/>
            tinuation of other numbers, when dissolved must, end in a unit: <lb/>
            and again it must begin with a unit, being afterwards com­ <lb/>
            pounded so as to make an illimitable multitude; on which <lb/>
            account those who have made the investigation of such matters <lb/>
            their study, have not called the unit a number, but rather an <lb/>
            element, and the beginning of number.</p>
          <p>Again this heavenly food of the soul which Moses calls <lb/>
            manna, the word of God divides in equal portions among all <lb/>
            who are to use it; taking care of equality in an extraordinary <lb/>
            degree. And Moses bears witness to this where he says, " He <lb/>
            who had much had not too much, and he who had but little <lb/>
            was in no want;"* since they all used that wonderful and most <lb/>
            desirable measure of proportion. On which account it hap­ <lb/>
            pened to the Israelites to learn that each of them was collect­ <lb/>
            ing not more for the men who were related to him than for the <lb/>
            reasonings and manners which were akin to him. For as much <lb/>
            as was sufficient for each man, that he was allotted in a <lb/>
            prudent manner, so as neither to feel any want or any super­ <lb/>
            fluitv.</p>
          <p>XL. And we may find something very much resembling <lb/>
            this equality, according, to analogy in the case of the festival <lb/>
            which is called the passover; and the passover is when the <lb/>
            soul is anxious to unlearn its subjection to the irrational <lb/>
            passions, and willingly submits itself to a reasonable mastery <lb/>
            over them. For it is expressly said, " If there be few that are <lb/>
            in thy house, so as not to be sufficient in number for a sheep, <lb/>
            then thou shalt take thy nearest neighbour in addition, <lb/>
            according to the number of souls,"t so that each person may <lb/>
            receive a sufficient share in proportion to the number of his <lb/>
            family, being such as he is found to be worthy of and to have <lb/>
            need of.</p>
          <p>But when, as if it were some country, he wishes to divide <lb/>
            out virtue among its inhabitants, he then allows the more <lb/>
            numerous body to have more, and the less numerous to have <lb/>
            less, thinking it reasonable not to allot a larger share to a <note type="footnote"> * Exodus xvi. 18. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Exodus xii. 16. </note> <note type="footnote"> K 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="132"/>
            smaller number, nor a smaller share to a larger number ; for <lb/>
            in such a case they would neither of them be suited to their <lb/>
            respective portions.</p>
          <p>XLI. But the most manifest instance of equality in respect <lb/>
            of number, is exhibited in the sacred offerings of the twelve <lb/>
            princes, and again in the portions of those offerings which are <lb/>
            distributed among the chiefs. For, says the scripture, " There <lb/>
            shall be an equal share allotted to each of the sons of Aaron."* <lb/>
            Equality is also very beautifully displayed in respect of the <lb/>
            composition of spices for purposes of fumigation ; for we read, <lb/>
            " Take to thyself sweet odours, stacte, onycha, galbanum, these <lb/>
            sweet spices with pure frankincense, all of the most chosen <lb/>
            kinds, all of equal weight and thou shalt make of it a <lb/>
            perfume, a confection after the art of the apothecary, a pure <lb/>
            composition, a holy work.”† For the Lord enjoins here that <lb/>
            each of the separate portions shall be equal to each, with a <lb/>
            view to the proper composition of the whole.</p>
          <p>And as I imagine these four ingredients of which the <lb/>
            entire perfume is composed are emblems of the four elements <lb/>
            of which the whole world is made ; he likens the stacte to <lb/>
            water, the onycha to land, the galbanum to the air, and the <lb/>
            pure transparent frankincense to fire ; for stacte, which derives <lb/>
            its name from the drops (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ϭταγόνες</foreign>) in which it falls is liquid, <lb/>
            and onycha is dry and earth-like, the sweet smelling gal­ <lb/>
            banum is added by way of giving a representation of the <lb/>
            air, for there is fragrance in the air ; and the transparency <lb/>
            which there is in frankincense serves for a representation of <lb/>
            fire. On which account also, he has separated the things <lb/>
            which have weight from those which are light, uniting the one <lb/>
            class by a closely connecting combination, and bringing forth <lb/>
            the other in a disunited form ; as where he says, " Take to thy­ <lb/>
            self sweet odours, stacte, onycha,” these things being weighty <lb/>
            he mentions unconnectedly, being the symbols of earth and <lb/>
            water. Afterwards he begins afresh with the other class, which <lb/>
            he mentions in combination, saying, " And the sweet, spice of <lb/>
            galbanum and the transparent frankincense," these again <lb/>
            being in their own nature emblems of the light things, air and <lb/>
            fire.</p>
          <p>And the harmonious composition and mixture of these <lb/>
            things is truly his most ancient and most perfect holy work, <note type="footnote"> * Numbers vii. 5. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Exodus xxx. 34 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="133"/>
            namely, the world ; which, speaking of it under the emblem <lb/>
            of perfume, lie thinks is bound to show gratitude to its <lb/>
            Creator. So that in name the composition which has been <lb/>
            carefully fabricated by the art of the apothecary may be offered <lb/>
            up, but in real fact the whole world which was created by <lb/>
            divine wisdom may be consecrated and dedicated, being made <lb/>
            a burnt offering of early in the morning and also in the <lb/>
            evening. For such a life as this becomes the world, namely, <lb/>
            continually and without ceasing to be giving thanks to its <lb/>
            Father and Creator, so as to stop short of nothing but evapo­ <lb/>
            rating and reducing itself into its original element. in order to <lb/>
            show that it stores up and conceals nothing, but dedicates <lb/>
            itself wholly as a pious offering to God who created it.</p>
          <p>XLII. And I marvel also at that sacred word which runs <lb/>
            on with zeal, in one continued course, without taking breath, <lb/>
            " In order to stand in the midst between the dead and the <lb/>
            living; and immediately," says Moses, "the plague was <lb/>
            stayed.”* But the evils which grind down and break to <lb/>
            pieces and crush our souls were not likely either to be stayed <lb/>
            or lightened, unless the reasoning, dear to God, had separated <lb/>
            off the holy men who live in sincerity, from the unholy who <lb/>
            in real truth are dead ; for, owing to the mere fact of being <lb/>
            near those who are sick, it has often happened that those who <lb/>
            were in perfect health have caught their disease, and have <lb/>
            been at the point of death : and it was impossible for them <lb/>
            any longer to be exposed to this affliction if they once sepa­ <lb/>
            rated by a strong boundary fixed in the middle between them, <lb/>
            which will preserve the better part by keeping off the inroads <lb/>
            and attacks of the worse.</p>
          <p>And I marvel still more, when listening to the sacred <lb/>
            oracles I learn from them in what manner " a cloud came in <lb/>
            the midst t" between the army of the Egyptians and the com­ <lb/>
            pany of the children of Israel; for the cloud no longer <lb/>
            permitted the race, which is temperate and beloved by God, <lb/>
            to be persecuted by that which was devoted to the passions <lb/>
            and a foe to God ; being a covering and a protection to its <lb/>
            friends, but a weapon of vengeance and chastisement against <lb/>
            its enemies; for it gently showers down wisdom on the minds <lb/>
            which study virtue-wisdom which cannot be visited by any <lb/>
            evil. But on those minds which are ill-disposed and unpro­ <note type="footnote"> * Numbers xvi. 48. </note> <note type="footnote"> † Exodus xiv. 19. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="134"/>
            ductive of knowledge, it pours forth a whole body of punish­ <lb/>
            ments, bringing upon them the most pitiable destruction of the <lb/>
            deluge.</p>
          <p>And the Father who created the universe has given to his <lb/>
            archangelic and most ancient Word a pre-eminent gift, to <lb/>
            stand on the confines of both, and separated that which had <lb/>
            been created from the Creator. And this same Word is con­ <lb/>
            tinually a suppliant to the immortal God on behalf of the <lb/>
            mortal race, which is exposed to affliction and misery ; and is <lb/>
            also the ambassador, sent by the Ruler of all, to the subject <lb/>
            race. And the Word rejoices in the gift, and, exulting in it, <lb/>
            announces it and boasts of it, saying, “ And I stood in the <lb/>
            midst, between the Lord and you;"* neither being uncreate <lb/>
            as God, nor yet created as you, but being in the midst <lb/>
            between these two extremities, like a hostage, as it were, to <lb/>
            both parties : a hostage to the Creator, as a pledge and secu­ <lb/>
            rity that the whole race would never fly off and revolt entirely, <lb/>
            choosing disorder rather than order ; and to the creature, to <lb/>
            lead it to entertain a confident hope that the merciful God <lb/>
            would not overlook his own work. For I will proclaim peace­ <lb/>
            ful intelligence to the creation from him who has determined <lb/>
            to destroy wars, namely God, who is ever the guardian of <lb/>
            peace.</p>
          <p>XLIII. Therefore the sacred Word, having given us instruc­ <lb/>
            tion respecting the division into equal parts, leads us also to <lb/>
            the knowledge of opposites, saying that God placed the <lb/>
            divisions “ opposite to one another ;"t for in fact nearly all <lb/>
            the things that exist in the world, are by nature opposite to <lb/>
            one another. And we must begin with the first.</p>
          <p>Hot is opposite to cold, and dry to wet, and light to heavy, <lb/>
            and darkness to light, and night to day; also in heaven that <lb/>
            which is fixed is opposite to the wandering planetary motion, <lb/>
            and in the air a clear sky is opposite to clouds, winter to <lb/>
            summer, autumn to spring, for the one is blooming and the <lb/>
            other fading. Again, of things on earth, sweet water is <lb/>
            opposite to bitter, and barren to fertile land. Again, there are <lb/>
            other things contrary to one another, as visible bodies to <lb/>
            incorporeal, things endowed with vitality to things inanimate, <lb/>
            rational to irrational, mortal to immortal, things discernible by <lb/>
            the outward sense to things perceptible only by the intellect; <note type="footnote"> * Numbers xvi. 48. </note> <note type="footnote"> f Genesis xv. 10. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="135"/>
            things comprehensible to things incomprehensible, elements <lb/>
            to things concrete and perfected, beginning to end, generation <lb/>
            to destruction, life to death, disease to health, white to black, ' <lb/>
            the right to the left, justice to injustice, wisdom to folly, <lb/>
            courage to cowardice, temperance to intemperance, virtue to <lb/>
            vice ; and all the species of one class to all the species of the <lb/>
            other class.</p>
          <p>Again, grammatical knowledge is contrary to ignorance of <lb/>
            the same subject, musical science to unacquaintance with <lb/>
            music, an educated to an illiterate condition ; and, in short, <lb/>
            skill in art to want of skill. Again, in the'different arts there <lb/>
            are vocal elements and mute elements, there are sharp and <lb/>
            flat sounds, there are straight and circular lines. Once more, <lb/>
            in animals and plants, there are some barren and some pro­ <lb/>
            ductive ; some very prolific, others which yield but small <lb/>
            increase ; animals oviparous and animals viviparous; animals <lb/>
            with soft skins, and others with hard shells; some wild and <lb/>
            some tractable creatures; some fond of solitude, and others <lb/>
            gregarious.</p>
          <p>To go on further : poverty is opposite to wealth, glory to want <lb/>
            of reputation, baseness of birth to nobility, want to abundance, <lb/>
            war to peace, law to lawlessness, a bad to a good disposition, <lb/>
            inactivity to labour, youth to old age, power to want of power, <lb/>
            weakness to strength. And why need I enumerate every class <lb/>
            separately, when these are unlimited and indescribable by <lb/>
            reason of their multitude? Very beautifully, therefore, has <lb/>
            the interpreter of the writings of nature, taking pity upon our <lb/>
            idleness and want of consideration, taught every one of us in <lb/>
            an invisible manner, as he does now, to arrange everything in <lb/>
            such a way as to produce an exact opposition, not arranging <lb/>
            them in wholes, but in equal divisions ; for one thing consists <lb/>
            of the two opposite parts; and when that one thing is bisected <lb/>
            then the opposite parts are easily known. Is not this the <lb/>
            thing which the Greeks say that Heraclitus, that great <lb/>
            philosopher who is so celebrated among them, put forth as the <lb/>
            leading principle of his whole philosophy, and boasted of it as <lb/>
            if it were a new discovery? For it is in reality an ancient <lb/>
            discovery of Moses, that out of the same thing opposite things <lb/>
            are produced having the ratio of parts to the whole, as has <lb/>
            here been shown.</p>
          <p>XLVI. These matters then we will examine into accurately <lb/>
             <pb n="136"/>
            on another occasion ; but there is this other point also, which <lb/>
            does not deserve to be passed over in silence. For the divi­ <lb/>
            sions into'two equal parts which have been mentioned become <lb/>
            six in number, since three animals were divided, so that the <lb/>
            Word which divided them made up the number seven, dividing <lb/>
            the two triads and establishing itself in the midst of them. <lb/>
            And a thing very similar to this appears to me to be very <lb/>
            clearly shown in the matter of the sacred candlestick ; for that <lb/>
            also was made having six branches, three on each side, and <lb/>
            the main candlestick itself in the middle made the seventh, <lb/>
            dividing and separating the two triads; for it is made of <lb/>
            carved .work, a divine work of exquisite skill and highly <lb/>
            admired, being made of one solid piece of pure gold. For the <lb/>
            unit, being one and single and pure, begot the number seven, <lb/>
            which had no mother but is born of itself alone, without taking <lb/>
            any additional material whatever to aid him.</p>
          <p>But those who praise gold say a great many other things <lb/>
            by way of panegyric on it, but dwell on two especial points <lb/>
            as most particularly important and excellent; one that it does <lb/>
            not receive poison, the other that it can be beaten out or melted <lb/>
            out into the thinnest possible plates, while still remaining <lb/>
            unbroken. Therefore it is very naturally taken as an emblem <lb/>
            of that greater nature, which, being extended and diffused <lb/>
            every where so as to penetrate in every direction, is whollyfull of <lb/>
            everything, and also connects all other things with the most <lb/>
            admirable arrangement.</p>
          <p>Concerning the candlestick above mentioned, the artist speaks <lb/>
            again a second time and says, that from its different branches <lb/>
            there are three arms projecting out on each side, equals in all <lb/>
            respects to one another, and having on the top lamps like nuts, <lb/>
            in the shape of flowers supporting the lights ; * the seventh <lb/>
            flower being fashioned on the top of the candlestick of solid <lb/>
            gold, and having seven golden places for lights above them ; so <lb/>
            that in many accounts it has been believed to be fashioned in <lb/>
            such a manner because the number six is divided into two <lb/>
            triads by the Word, making the seventh and being placed in the <lb/>
            midst of them; as indeed is the case now. For the entire candle­ <lb/>
            stick with its six most entire and principal parts was made so <lb/>
            as to consist of seven lamps, and seven flowers, and seven lights ; <lb/>
            and the six lights are divided by the seventh. And in like <note type="footnote"> * Exodus xxv. 33. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="137"/>
            manner the flowers are divided by that which comes in the <lb/>
            middle ; and in the same manner also the lamps are divided by <lb/>
            the seventh which comes in the middle. But the six branches, <lb/>
            and the equal number of arms which shoot out are divided by <lb/>
            the main trunk itself which makes up the number seven.</p>
          <p>XLV. But the long discussion which some people start with <lb/>
            respect to each of these, must be postponed to a subsequent <lb/>
            opportunity. Thus much alone we must remind our readers of <lb/>
            at this moment, that the sacred candlestick and the seven lights <lb/>
            upon it are an imitation of the wandering of the seven planets <lb/>
            through the heaven. How so ? some one will say. Because, <lb/>
            we will reply, in the same manner as the lights, so also does <lb/>
            every one of the planets shed its rays. They therefore, being <lb/>
            more brilliant, do transmit more brilliant beams to the earth, <lb/>
            and brilliant beyond them all is he who is the centre one of the <lb/>
            seven, the sun. And I call him the centre, not merely because <lb/>
            he has the central position, as some have thought, but also <lb/>
            because he has on many other accounts a right to be ministered <lb/>
            unto and attended by the others accompanying him as body- <lb/>
            guards on each side, by reason of his dignity and his magnitude, <lb/>
            and the great benefits which he pours upon all earthly things.</p>
          <p>But men, being unable completely to comprehend the <lb/>
            arrangement of the planets (and in fact what other of the <lb/>
            heavenly bodies can they understand with certainty and clear­ <lb/>
            ness?) speak according to their conjectures. And these persons <lb/>
            appear to me to form the best conjectures on such subjects, who, <lb/>
            having assigned the central position to the sun, say that there <lb/>
            is an equal number of planets, namely, those above him and <lb/>
            below him. Those above him being Saturn, Jupiter, and Mars ; <lb/>
            then comes the Sun himself, and next to him Mercury, Venus, <lb/>
            and the Moon, which last is close to the air. The Creator <lb/>
            therefore, wishing that there should be a model upon earth <lb/>
            among us of the seven-lighted sphere as it exists in heaven, <lb/>
            ordained this exquisite work to be made, namely, this candle­ <lb/>
            stick. And its likeness to the soul is often pointed out too ; for <lb/>
            the soul is divisible into three parts, and each of the parts, as <lb/>
            has been already pointed out, is divided into two more. And <lb/>
            thus there being six divisions, the sacred and divine Word, the <lb/>
            divider of them all, very naturally makes up the number seven.</p>
          <p>XLVI. This other point also is too important to deserve to <lb/>
            be passed over in silence: that, as there are three vessels <lb/>
             <pb n="138"/>
            among the sacred furniture, a candlestick, a bath, and an altar <lb/>
            of incense; the altar of incense has reference to that grati­ <lb/>
            tude which is exhibited for the bestowal of the elements, as <lb/>
            has been shown before, since it does itself also receive a por­ <lb/>
            tion from these four, receiving wood from the earth, and the <lb/>
            spices which are burnt from the water; for, being first of all <lb/>
            liquefied, they are dissolved into drops of moisture, and vapour <lb/>
            from the air, and form the fire the spark which kindles the <lb/>
            whole; and the composition of frankincense, and galbanum, <lb/>
            and onycha, and stacte, is a symbol of the four elements; and <lb/>
            the table is referred to the gratitude which is displayed for <lb/>
            the mortal things which are made out of the elements, for <lb/>
            loaves and libations are placed upon it, which the creatures <lb/>
            who stand in need of nourishment must of necessity use. And <lb/>
            the candlestick has reference to the gratitude exhibited for all <lb/>
            the things existing in heaven, in order that no portion of the <lb/>
            world may lie under the imputation of ingratitude; but that <lb/>
            we may see that every single part of it gives thanks, the ele­ <lb/>
            ments, the things made of them, and not those only which <lb/>
            are made on earth, but also those in heaven.</p>
          <p>XLVII. And it is worth while to consider why, after <lb/>
            having explained the measures of the table and of the altar of <lb/>
            incense, he has given no such description of the candlestick; <lb/>
            may it not be, perhaps, for the reason that the elements and <lb/>
            all the mortal things which are compounded of them, of which <lb/>
            the table and the altar of incense are symbols, have been <lb/>
            measured, inasmuch as they are terminated in heaven ? For that <lb/>
            which surrounds anything is invariably the measure of that <lb/>
            which is surrounded ; but the heaven, of which the candlestick <lb/>
            is the symbol, is of infinite magnitude; for it is indeed sur­ <lb/>
            rounded, but not, according to the account of Moses, by a <lb/>
            vacuum, nor by any substance, nor by anything which is of <lb/>
            equal magnitude with itself, nor by anything of unlimited size, <lb/>
            in accordance with the marvellous fables which we touched <lb/>
            upon when speaking of the building of the tower'; but its boun­ <lb/>
            dary is God, and he also is its ruler and the director of its <lb/>
            course.</p>
          <p>As, therefore, the living God is incomprehensible, so also <lb/>
            that which is bounded by him is not measured by any mea­ <lb/>
            sures which come within the range of our intellect; and, <lb/>
            perhaps, inasmuch as it is of circular form and skilfully <lb/>
             <pb n="139"/>
            fashioned into a perfect square, it has no participation in either <lb/>
            length or breadth.</p>
          <p>XLVIII. Therefore, after he has said what is becoming on <lb/>
            this subject, he proceeds to add, " But the birds he did not <lb/>
            divide;"* meaning, by the term birds, the two reasonings <lb/>
            which are winged and inclined by nature to soar to the investi­ <lb/>
            gation of sublime subjects; one of them being the archetypal <lb/>
            pattern and above us, and the other being the copy of the <lb/>
            former and abiding among us. And Moses calls the one <lb/>
            which is above us the image of God, and the one which abides <lb/>
            among us the impression of that image, " For," says he, "God <lb/>
            made man," not an image, “ but after the image."f So that the <lb/>
            mind which is in each of us, which is in reality and truth the man, <lb/>
            is a third image proceeding from the Creator. But the inter­ <lb/>
            mediate one is a model of the one and a copy of the other. But <lb/>
            by nature our mind is indivisible; for the Creator, having <lb/>
            divided the irrational part of the soul into six portions, has <lb/>
            made six divisions of it, namely, sight, taste, hearing, smell­ <lb/>
            ing. touch, and voice ; but the rational part, which is called <lb/>
            the mind he has left undivided, according to the likeness of <lb/>
            the entire heaven. For in this, also, there is is a report that <lb/>
            the outermost sphere, which is destitute of motion, is pre­ <lb/>
            served without being divided, but that the inner one is divided <lb/>
            into six portions, and thus completes the seven circles of what <lb/>
            are called the planets: for I imagine the heaven is in the <lb/>
            world the same thing that the soul is in the human being. <lb/>
            They say, therefore, that these two natures, full of reason and <lb/>
            comprehension-that, I mean, which exists in mail and that <lb/>
            which exists in the world-are both at all times entire and <lb/>
            indivisible.</p>
          <p>On this account, therefore, it is that the scriptures tell us, <lb/>
            “ He did not divide the birds." For our own mind is here <lb/>
            compared to a dove, since that is a creature which is tame and <lb/>
            domesticated among us; and the turtle dove is compared to <lb/>
            the model presented by the other, that is to say, by the mind <lb/>
            of the world, the heaven; for the word of God is fond of <lb/>
            retirement, and solitude, and privacy; not mixing itself up <lb/>
            with the crowd of things which have been created and will be <lb/>
            destroyed, but being at all times accustomed to roam on high, <lb/>
            and being anxious to be an attendant only on the one supreme <lb/>
            Being. <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xv. 10. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Genesis i. 27. </note> <pb n="140"/>
            </p>
          <p>Therefore, the two natures are indivisible; the nature, I <lb/>
            mean, of the reasoning power in us, and of the divine Word <lb/>
            above us; but though they are indivisible themselves, they <lb/>
            divide an innumerable multitude of other things. For it is <lb/>
            the divine Word which divided and distributed every thing in <lb/>
            nature; and it is our own mind which divides every thing and <lb/>
            every body which it comprehends, by the exertion of its intel­ <lb/>
            lect in an infinite manner, into an infinite number of parts, <lb/>
            and which, in fact, never ceases from dividing. And this <lb/>
            happens by reason of its resemblance to the Creator and <lb/>
            Father of the universe; for the divine nature, being unmin­ <lb/>
            gled, uncombined with any thing else, and most completely <lb/>
            destitute of parts, has been to the whole world the cause of <lb/>
            mixture, and combination, and of an infinite variety of parts : <lb/>
            so that. very naturally, the two things which thus resemble <lb/>
            each other, both the mind which is in us and that which is <lb/>
            above us, being without parts and indivisible, will still be able <lb/>
            in a powerful manner to divide and distribute all existing <lb/>
            things.</p>
          <p>XL1X. Therefore, after Moses has mentioned the facts of <lb/>
            birds not being cut in two pieces or divided, he proceeds to <lb/>
            say, " And the birds came down and descended upon the bodies <lb/>
            which were divided;"* using indeed expressions which are <lb/>
            synonymous, but still representing the variance which exists in <lb/>
            the facts in a most visible manner to those who are able to see. <lb/>
            For it is contrary to nature that birds should come down, when <lb/>
            they have been given wings for the purpose of soaring on high. <lb/>
            For, as the earth is the most appropriate place for land animals, <lb/>
            and above all for reptiles, which do not endure even to crawl <lb/>
            upon it, but seek caves and lurking places, avoiding the regions <lb/>
            which are above, on account of their kindred with the things <lb/>
            which are below ; so, in the same manner, the air is the appro­ <lb/>
            priate abode for the winged race, the element which is by <lb/>
            nature light is the proper home for those creatures which are <lb/>
            light by reason of their being feathered.</p>
          <p>When, therefore, those creatures, whose nature it is to <lb/>
            traverse the air and who ought to roam through the æther, <lb/>
            descend and come down upon the land, they are unable to live <lb/>
            a life according to their nature. On the other hand, Moses <lb/>
            approves, in no ordinary degree, of whatever reptiles are able <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xv. 11. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="141"/>
            to take a leap in an upward direction. At all events lie says, <lb/>
            “Ye shall eat of these winged reptiles which go upon four feet, <lb/>
            and which have legs above their feet so as to be able by them <lb/>
            to leap up from the ground.”* But these reptiles are the <lb/>
            emblems of souls, which like reptiles being rooted in the earthly <lb/>
            body, when they are raised up, get strength to soar on high, <lb/>
            taking the heaven in exchange for the earth, and immortality <lb/>
            in exchange for destruction. We must, therefore, think that <lb/>
            they are full of every description of misery, which, having <lb/>
            been brought up in the air, and in the æther which is the <lb/>
            purest of all things, have changed their abode (not being able <lb/>
            to bear the satiety of divine things), and have descended to <lb/>
            that mortal and evil district, the earth.</p>
          <p>And there are innumerable imaginations concerning an <lb/>
            innumerable variety of things which roam about upon it also ; <lb/>
            some voluntary, and some out of ignorance, which are in no <lb/>
            respect different from winged creatures, and which Moses <lb/>
            compares to the birds that come down. And of these imagina­ <lb/>
            tions those which take the upward course belong to the better <lb/>
            class, since virtue, which conducts the mind towards heaven <lb/>
            and the divine country, travels with them. But those which <lb/>
            take the downward course belong to the worse class, since <lb/>
            wickedness guides them and drags them in the contrary <lb/>
            direction by force. And their very names do, to a great extent, <lb/>
            show the opposite character of the places. For virtue (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀρετὴ</foreign>) <lb/>
            has derived its name not only from the word (<foreign xml:lang="grc">αἵϱεϭις</foreign>) choice, <lb/>
            but also from the fact of its being lifted up (<foreign xml:lang="grc">παϱὰ</foreign> TO <foreign xml:lang="grc">αἴϱεϭθαι</foreign>), <lb/>
            for it is lifted up (<foreign xml:lang="grc">αἴϱεται</foreign>) and borne on high because it always <lb/>
            loves heavenly things; but wickedness (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ϰαϰία</foreign>) is so called <lb/>
            from its tendency to go downwards (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀπὸ του̃ ϰάτω ϰεχωϱηϰέναι</foreign>), <lb/>
            and also because it compels those who practise it to iall down <lb/>
            to the bottom (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ϰαταπίπτειν</foreign>).</p>
          <p>Accordingly the thoughts of the soul which are at variance <lb/>
            with one another, flying towards and descending upon the <lb/>
            earth, both come down themselves and also throw the mind <lb/>
            down too, mingling with bodies in a disgraceful degree, and <lb/>
            with things which are perceptible by the outward senses, not <lb/>
            discernible by the intellect, imperfect not entire, perishable <lb/>
            and not living. For they mix themselves up not only with <lb/>
            bodies, but also with the divisions of the bodies which have <note type="footnote"> * Leviticus xi. 21. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="142"/>
            been divided in two parts. And it is quite impossible that <lb/>
            things which have been divided in this way should ever again <lb/>
            admit of adaptation and union ; since the nerves of the spirit, <lb/>
            which were the strongest natural bond in them, are cut in <lb/>
            two.</p>
          <p>L. Moreover, Moses introduces a very true opinion when he <lb/>
            teaches us that justice and every virtue loves the soul, but <lb/>
            that wickedness and every vice is attached to the body ; ' and <lb/>
            that what is friendly to the one is in every case of necessity <lb/>
            hostile to the other, as is the case even now. For having <lb/>
            figuratively represented the wars of the soul, he then intro­ <lb/>
            duces birds as eager to involve themselves with and to cling to <lb/>
            the bodies, and to satiate themselves with the flesh, the inroads <lb/>
            and attacks of which the virtuous man, desiring to check, is <lb/>
            said to sit by them as if he were a sort of curator or overseer <lb/>
            of them. For when his domestic affairs were thrown into con­ <lb/>
            fusion by domestic sedition, and when the armies of the enemy <lb/>
            were proceeding against him, he collected a wise council and <lb/>
            deliberated with respect to the adversaries ; in order that if he <lb/>
            could possibly do so, using persuasion he might both put an <lb/>
            end to the foreign war, and also remove the domestic confusion; <lb/>
            for it was desirable to disperse those enemies who wore <lb/>
            gathering over him like a cloud, and who were full of irre­ <lb/>
            concileable enmity to him; and equally so to re-establish with <lb/>
            the other party the relations which had previously existed.</p>
          <p>Now those who are irreconcilable and implacable enemies <lb/>
            are set down thus ; the follies and intemperances of the soul, <lb/>
            cowardice and injustice, and all the other irrational appetites <lb/>
            which are accustomed to be generated by luxuriant and impo­ <lb/>
            tent appetite, raising their heads high and becoming restiff, <lb/>
            and preventing the mind from proceeding in its straight <lb/>
            course ; and very often throwing its whole system into confusion <lb/>
            and beating it down.</p>
          <p>But the attacks and conflicts of those powers which are not <lb/>
            irreconcilable resemble the frequent effect of the discussions <lb/>
            and quarrels about doctrines which arise among the Sophists. <lb/>
            For inasmuch as they all labour for one end, namely the con­ <lb/>
            templation of the things of nature, they may be said to be friends; <lb/>
            but inasmuch as they do not agree in their particular investi­ <lb/>
            gations they may be said to be in a state of domestic sedition ; <lb/>
            as, for instance, those who affirm the universe to be uncreated <lb/>
             <pb n="143"/>
            are-at variance with those who insist upon its creation; and <lb/>
            again those who urge that it will be destroyed are at strife <lb/>
            with those who affirm that it is indeed perishable by nature <lb/>
            but that it never will be destroyed, because it is held together <lb/>
            by a more powerful chain, the will of the Creator. And again, <lb/>
            those who affirm that there is nothing self-existent, but that <lb/>
            everything has been created, are at variance with those who <lb/>
            are of a contrary opinion, Those too, who say that man is <lb/>
            he measure of all things, differ from those who would restrain <lb/>
            the judicial faculties of the outward senses and of the intellect. <lb/>
            And, in short, to sum up all these differences in a few words, <lb/>
            those who represent everything as incomprehensible are at <lb/>
            variance with those who say that a great number of things are <lb/>
            properly understood.</p>
          <p>And the sun, and the moon, and the whole heaven, and the <lb/>
            earth, and the air, and the water, and all the things that are <lb/>
            connected with them, afford subject for strife and contention <lb/>
            to those who are fond of examining into such subjects, and <lb/>
            who investigate their essences, and distinctive qualities, and <lb/>
            changes, and alterations, and moreover their origin and the <lb/>
            method of their destruction : and making no superficial <lb/>
            investigation into the magnitude and motion of the heavenly <lb/>
            bodies, they adopt all sorts of different opinions, never agreeing <lb/>
            together, until some man, who is at the same time skilful at <lb/>
            disentangling controversies and calculated to judge, takes his <lb/>
            seat on the tribunal, and comes to a clear perception of the <lb/>
            progeny of each individual's soul, and discards those which do <lb/>
            not deserve to be maintained, and preserves those which are <lb/>
            good, and which be pronounces worthy of suitable providential <lb/>
            care. And all the controversies of philosophy are full of <lb/>
            disagreement, since the truth escapes the intellect which is <lb/>
            given to plausibilities and conjectures: for it is the very <lb/>
            difficulty of discovering and seizing hold of the nature of truth <lb/>
            that, in my opinion, has given rise to so many quarrels.</p>
          <p>LI. "And about the setting of the sun a trance fell upon <lb/>
            Abraham, and, behold, fear with great darkness fell upon him.”* <lb/>
            Now there is one kind of trance which is a sort of frantic <lb/>
            delirium, causing infirmity of mind, either through old age, <lb/>
            or melancholy, or some other similar cause. There is another <lb/>
            kind which is excessive consternation, arising usually from <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xv. 12. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="144"/>
            things which happen suddenly and unexpectedly. Another <lb/>
            kind is mere tranquillity of the mind, arising when it is inclined <lb/>
            by nature to be quiet: but that which is the best description of <lb/>
            all is a divinely inspired and more vehement sort of enthu­ <lb/>
            siasm. which the race of prophets is subject to.</p>
          <p>Now the first kind Moses mentions in the curses which are <lb/>
            recorded in Deuteronomy : for he says that, “ delirium and <lb/>
            blindness, and aberration of mind shall seize on the impious,"* <lb/>
            so that they shall differ in no respect from blind persons at <lb/>
            mid-day, being like people feeling their way in deep darkness. <lb/>
            The second kind he mentions in many places ; for he says, <lb/>
            And Isaac was astonished with a great astonishment, and <lb/>
            said, Who, then, is it who went out to hunt for game for me, <lb/>
            and who brought it to me ? And I ate of it all before you <lb/>
            come, and I have blessed him ; yea, and he shall be blessed.”† <lb/>
            And, again, with reference to Jacob, who disbelieved those <lb/>
            who told him that " Joseph is alive, and is ruler over the whole <lb/>
            land of Egypt; for he," says the scripture, " was amazed in <lb/>
            his mind, for he believed them not." t And, again, in Exodus, <lb/>
            in the assembly of the people, we read : “ For the whole of <lb/>
            the mountain of Sinai was enveloped in smoke, because God <lb/>
            descended upon it in fire. And the smoke went up as the <lb/>
            vapour of a furnace, and the whole people was greatly asto­ <lb/>
            nished.”§ Also, in Leviticus, when speaking of the conse­ <lb/>
            cration of the priests on the eighth day, when fire came out <lb/>
            from heaven and licked up what was on the altar, and the <lb/>
            burnt-offerings and the fat, the historian proceeds immediately <lb/>
            to tell us, “ And the whole people saw it and were astonished, <lb/>
            and fell upon their faces;”|| for such astonishment as this <lb/>
            causes alarm and consternation.</p>
          <p>And ought we not especially to wonder in the case of Esau, <lb/>
            that he who was skilful in hunting was nevertheless himself <lb/>
            continually caught and supplanted, having acquired his skill to <lb/>
            his own injury and not to his advantage, and that he never used <lb/>
            any great care to catch anything in his hunts ? And also in <lb/>
            the case of Jacob, that he hunts without having acquired any <lb/>
            skill by learning, but only as he is moved by nature; and that <lb/>
            he brings what he has caught to the examiner, who will dis­ <lb/>
            tinguish whether it deserves to be approved; on which account <note type="footnote"> * Deut. xxviii, 28. </note> <note type="footnote"> † Genesis xxvii. 33. </note> <note type="footnote">‡ Genesis xlv. 26. </note> <note type="footnote"> $ Exodus xix. IS. </note> <note type="footnote"> || Leviticus IX. 24. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="145"/>
            he " eateth of it all.''* For everything that relates to medi. <lb/>
            tation is wholesome food, whether it be investigation, or <lb/>
            consideration, or hearing, or reading, or prayer, or self-restraint, <lb/>
            or a contempt for things indifferent: and he ate, as I imagine, <lb/>
            the first fruits of them all, but he did not eat the whole of all; <lb/>
            for some appropriate food must be left for him who meditates <lb/>
            as a reward for his pains. And the words, " before you came," <lb/>
            are added out of regard for the nature of the thing; for if <lb/>
            passion enters into the soul, we shall not enjoy temperance. <lb/>
            And it convicts the worthless man as slow, and hesitating, and <lb/>
            procrastinating, as to the works of instruction, but not as to <lb/>
            those of intemperance. Therefore Egypt contains inspectors <lb/>
            of works, who devote themselves with energy to securing the <lb/>
            enjoyment of the passions. But Moses, on the other hand, <lb/>
            commands the Israelites to eat the passover in haste, and to <lb/>
            celebrate the migration from these passions in this way. And <lb/>
            Judah says: “ For if we had not delayed, we should by this <lb/>
            time have returned, and have arrived again in Egypt; aye, <lb/>
            and a second time should we have returned safe from thence."t</p>
          <p>And very naturally did Jacob wonder whether the mind was <lb/>
            still in the body; that is to say, whether Joseph was alive to <lb/>
            virtue and ruling over the body, and not being ruled over by it. <lb/>
            And any one who chooses to go through all the other instances, <lb/>
            would be able to trace out the truth. But our present subject <lb/>
            does not require any accurate discussion of these matters ; on <lb/>
            which account we had better return to the point from which we <lb/>
            set out.</p>
          <p>With respect to the third kind of trance, he philosophises <lb/>
            in this manner when speaking of the creation of the woman ; <lb/>
            " For the Lord God," says Moses, "cast a trance upon Adam, <lb/>
            and he slept.”‡ Here calling the quietness and tranquillity of <lb/>
            mind a trance; for the slumber of the mind is the awaking of <lb/>
            the outward sense : and, again, the awaking of the intellect is <lb/>
            the reducing of the outward senses to a state of inactivity.</p>
          <p>LII. An instance of the fourth kind of trance is the one <lb/>
            which we are now considering: " And about the setting of the <lb/>
            sun a trance fell upon Abraham," he being thrown into a state <lb/>
            of enthusiasm and inspired by the Deity. But this is not the <lb/>
            only thing which shows him to have been a prophet, but also <lb/>
            the express words which are engraven in the sacred scriptures <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xxvii. 33. </note> <note type="footnote"> † Genesis xliii. 9. </note> <note type="footnote">‡ Genesis ii. 21. </note> <note type="footnote"> VOL. If. </note> <note type="footnote"> L </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="146"/>
            as on a pillar. When some one endeavoured to separate <lb/>
            Sarah, that is, the virtue which is derived from nature, from <lb/>
            him, as if she had not been the peculiar property of the wise <lb/>
            man alone, but had also belonged to every one who made any <lb/>
            pretence to wisdom, God said, " Give the man back his wife, <lb/>
            because he is a prophet, and he will pray for thee, and thou <lb/>
            shalt live ;”* and the sacred scriptures testify in the case of <lb/>
            every good man, that he is a prophet; for a prophet says <lb/>
            nothing of his own, but everything which he says is strange <lb/>
            and prompted by some one else; and it is not lawful for a <lb/>
            wicked man to be an interpreter of God, as also no wicked <lb/>
            man can be properly said to be inspired ; but this statement is <lb/>
            only appropriate to the wise man alone, since he alone is a <lb/>
            sounding instrument of God's voice, being struck and moved <lb/>
            to sound in an invisible manner by him.</p>
          <p>Accordingly, all those whom Moses describes as just persons <lb/>
            he has also represented as inspired and prophesying. Noah <lb/>
            was a just man ; was he not also by that fact a prophet? or <lb/>
            did he, without being possessed by any divine inspiration, <lb/>
            utter those prayers and curses which he applied to the gene­ <lb/>
            rations which should come hereafter, and all of which were <lb/>
            eventually confirmed by the reality of the facts ? Why should <lb/>
            I speak of Isaac? Why of Jacob? For these also are mani­ <lb/>
            festly found to have been prophets by many other circum­ <lb/>
            stances, and especially by their addresses to their children. For <lb/>
            the annunciation, " Assemble yourselves together, that I may <lb/>
            tell you what shall happen to you in the last days,”† was the <lb/>
            expression of a man possessed by inspiration ; for the know­ <lb/>
            ledge of the future is not appropriate to, or natural to, man. <lb/>
            What shall we say of Moses ? is he not celebrated everywhere <lb/>
            as a prophet? For the scripture says, “ If there shall be <lb/>
            among you a prophet of the Lord, I will make myself known <lb/>
            unto him in a vision,”‡ but to Moses God appeared in his ac­ <lb/>
            tual appearance and not by a riddle. And again we read, <lb/>
            “ There arose not any more any prophet like unto Moses, <lb/>
            whom the Lord knew face to face.”§ Very admirably, there­ <lb/>
            fore, does the historian here point out, that Abraham was <lb/>
            under the influence of inspiration when he says that, “ About <lb/>
            the setting of the sun a trance fell upon him." <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xx. 7. </note><note type="footnote">‡ Numbers xii. 6, </note> <note type="footnote"> † Genesis xlix. 2. </note><note type="footnote"> § Deuteronomy xxxiv. 10. </note> <pb n="147"/>
            </p>
          <p>LIII. And under the symbol of the sun he intimates our <lb/>
            mind : for what reasoning is in us, that the sun is in the world. <lb/>
            Since each of them gives light, the one casting a light which <lb/>
            is perceptible by the outward senses, to shine upon the uni­ <lb/>
            verse ; and the other shedding their beams, discernible only by <lb/>
            the intellect by means of our apprehensions, upon ourselves. <lb/>
            As long therefore as our mind still shines around and hovers <lb/>
            around, pouring as it were a noontide light into the whole <lb/>
            soul, we, being masters of ourselves, are not possessed by any <lb/>
            extraneous influence; but when it approaches its setting, <lb/>
            then, as is natural, a trance, which proceeds from inspiration, <lb/>
            takes violent hold of us, and madness seizes upon us, for <lb/>
            when the divine light shines the human light sets, and when <lb/>
            the divine light sets this other rises and shines, and this very <lb/>
            frequently happens to the race of prophets; for the mind that <lb/>
            is in us is removed from its place at the arrival of the divine <lb/>
            Spirit, but is again restored to its previous habitation when <lb/>
            that Spirit departs, for it is contrary to holy law for what is <lb/>
            mortal to dwell with what is immortal.</p>
          <p>On this account the setting of our reason, and the darkness <lb/>
            which surrounds it, causes a trance and a heaven-inflicted <lb/>
            madness. After that the historian connects with his preced­ <lb/>
            ing account what follows in consistency with it, saying, " And <lb/>
            it was said to Abraham—for in real truth the prophet, even <lb/>
            when he appears to be speaking, is silent, and another being <lb/>
            is employing his vocal organs, his mouth and tongue, for the <lb/>
            explanation of what things he chooses; and operating on these <lb/>
            organs by some invisible and very skilful act, he makes them <lb/>
            utter a sweet and harmonious sound, full of every kind of <lb/>
            melody.</p>
          <p>LIV. And it is well to hear what the things are which are <lb/>
            thus said to have been predicted to Abraham. In the first <lb/>
            place, that God does not grant to the man who loves virtue to <lb/>
            dwell in the body as in his own native land, but only to <lb/>
            sojourn in it as in a foreign country. " For knowing," says <lb/>
            the scripture, " thou shalt know that thy seed shall be sojourners <lb/>
            in a land which is not theirs.”* But the district of the body <lb/>
            is akin to every bad man, and in it he is desirous to abide as a <lb/>
            dweller, not as a sojourner. Accordingly, these words contain <lb/>
            this as one lesson; another is, that the things which bring <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xv. 13 </note> <note type="footnote"> L 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="148"/>
            slavery and disaster and bitter humiliation, as the prophet <lb/>
            himself tells us, upon the soul are the dwellings upon earth. <lb/>
            For the affections of the body are truly spurious and foreign, <lb/>
            being produced by the flesh, in which they are rooted. And <lb/>
            this slavery lasts four hundred years in accordance with the <lb/>
            powers of the four passions.</p>
          <p>For when pleasure rules, the mind is elated and puffed up, <lb/>
            being carried away by empty vanity. Again, when appetite <lb/>
            gets the upper hand, a desire for absent things is engendered, <lb/>
            which suspends the mind upon unaccomplished hopes, as if in <lb/>
            a halter ; for then the mind is always thirsting and yet is <lb/>
            unable to drink, enduring the punishment of Tantalus. Again, <lb/>
            when under the influence of grief, the mind is tortured and <lb/>
            contracted, like trees the leaves of which are falling off and <lb/>
            withering; for all its flourishing and nutritious particles are <lb/>
            dried up. Also, when fire obtains the supremacy, no one any <lb/>
            longer chooses to remain, but betakes to flight and running <lb/>
            away, thinking that that is the only way in which he can be <lb/>
            saved. For appetite, having an attractive power even if the <lb/>
            object which is desired retreats, compels one to pursue it; and <lb/>
            fear, on the other hand, causing alienation, separates one from <lb/>
            it, and makes one remove to a distance from what is presented <lb/>
            to one's view.</p>
          <p>LV. But the supremacy of these different passions before <lb/>
            mentioned inflicts terrible slavery on those who are ruled over <lb/>
            by them, until God, the umpire and judge of all things, sepa­ <lb/>
            rates that which is ill treated from that which is inflicting <lb/>
            ill treatment, and delivers the former and blesses it with <lb/>
            perfect freedom, and inflicts upon the other a retribution for <lb/>
            the wickedness which it has committed. For we read in the <lb/>
            next verse, “And the nation to which they shall be slaves I <lb/>
            will judge, and after that they shall go forth with great <lb/>
            substance."* For it is inevitable that a mortal man must <lb/>
            obey the nature of the passions, and that a man who has been <lb/>
            born must endure the fate which is allotted to him as appro­ <lb/>
            priate ; but it is the will of God to lighten the evils which are <lb/>
            planted contemporaneously with our birth. So that even if we <lb/>
            at the beginning suffer such evils as are properly assigned to us, <lb/>
            become slaves of cruel masters, and if God also performs what <lb/>
            is his peculiar work, proclaiming emancipation and freedom to <note type="footnote"> Genesis xv. 14. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="149"/>
            the souls which address their supplications to him, then he <lb/>
            not only gives men a release from their bondage and a means <lb/>
            of departure from their prison all guarded round as it is, but <lb/>
            he also gives them the means of travelling, which he here <lb/>
            calls substance.</p>
          <p>And what is this ? When the mind having come down <lb/>
            from above from heaven becomes entangled in the necessities <lb/>
            of the body, then, although it is not allured by any of these, <lb/>
            still, like a eunuch or impotent person, it embraces pleasant <lb/>
            evils. But if it remains in its own nature, then, being truly a <lb/>
            man, it resists and discards them instead of being overthrown <lb/>
            by them, being initiated in all the parts of complete encyclical <lb/>
            learning; from which it derives a desire for contemplation, <lb/>
            and acquires temperance and patience, very vigorous virtues, <lb/>
            leaving its former abode, and finding a means of return back <lb/>
            to its own country, and bringing with it all the lessons of <lb/>
            instruction, which are here called supplies for the journey.</p>
          <p>LVI. Having said thus much on these subjects, the histo­ <lb/>
            rian proceeds : " And thou shalt depart to thy fathers, having <lb/>
            lived in peace, in a good old age.”* Therefore we, who are <lb/>
            imperfect, are made war upon, and we become slaves, and only <lb/>
            with difficulty do we find any relief from the dangers which <lb/>
            impend over us. But the perfect race, exempt from slavery <lb/>
            and free from the perils of war, is bred up in peace and the <lb/>
            firmest freedom. And there is a particular lesson to be learnt <lb/>
            from his representing the good man not as dying but depart­ <lb/>
            ing, in order to show that the race of the soul, which is <lb/>
            completely purified, cannot be extinguished and cannot die, <lb/>
            but only departs in the way of migration from this earth to <lb/>
            heaven, not undergoing that dissolution and destruction which <lb/>
            death appears to bring with it And after the words, " Thou <lb/>
            shalt depart," he adds, " to thy fathers. It is here worth <lb/>
            while to consider what kind of fathers is meant; for God can <lb/>
            never mean those who had passed their lives in the country of <lb/>
            the Chaldeans, among whom alone he had lived as being his <lb/>
            relations, because he had been commanded by a sacred oracle <lb/>
            to depart from those who were his kinsmen by blood.</p>
          <p>For, says the historian, "The Lord said unto Abraham, <lb/>
            Depart from out of thy land, and from thy kindred, and from <lb/>
            thy father's house, to a land which I will show thee ; and I will <note type="footnote"> it Genesis xv. 15. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="150"/>
            make thee into a great nation."* For how can it be reason­ <lb/>
            able for him who was once been removed from his abode by <lb/>
            the interference of Divine Providence, to return and dwell <lb/>
            again in the same place ? And how could it be reasonable for <lb/>
            one who was about to be the leader of a new nation and 01 <lb/>
            another race to be again assigned to his ancient one? For <lb/>
            God would never have given to him a new character, and a <lb/>
            new nation and family, if he had not wholly and entirely sepa­ <lb/>
            rated him from his ancient one. For that man is truly a chief <lb/>
            of a nation and ruler of a family, from whom, as from a root, <lb/>
            sprang that branch so fond of investigating and contemplating <lb/>
            the affairs of our nature, by name Israel, since an express com­ <lb/>
            mand has been given " to remove the old things from before <lb/>
            the face of those which are new."‡ For where is any longer <lb/>
            the use of investigations into antiquity, and ancient, and long­ <lb/>
            established customs, to those in whom on a sudden, when they <lb/>
            have no such expectation, God rains all kinds of new blessings <lb/>
            in a mass ?</p>
          <p>LVII. Therefore, when he says " fathers," he means not <lb/>
            those whose souls have departed from them, and who are <lb/>
            buried in the tombs of the land of Chaldea; but, as some say, <lb/>
            the sun, and the moon, and the other stars: for some affirm <lb/>
            that it is owing to these bodies that the nature of all the <lb/>
            things in the world has its existence. But as some other <lb/>
            persons think he means the archetypal ideas, those models of <lb/>
            these things which are perceptible by the outward senses and <lb/>
            visible; which models, however, are only perceptible by the <lb/>
            intellect and invisible ; and that it is to these that the mind <lb/>
            of the wise man emigrates. Some, again, have fancied that <lb/>
            by " fathers," are here meant the four principles and powers <lb/>
            of which the world is composed-the earth, the water, the air, <lb/>
            and the fire ; for they say, that all created things are very <lb/>
            properly dissolved into these elements. For as nouns, and <lb/>
            verbs, and all the other parts of speech, consist of the elements <lb/>
            of grammar, and again are resolvable into these ultimate prin­ <lb/>
            ciples, so, in the same manner, each individual among us, <lb/>
            being compounded of the four elements, and borrowing small <lb/>
            portions from each essence, does, at certain fixed periods, repay <lb/>
            what he has borrowed, giving what he has dry to the earth, <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xii. 1. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Leviticus XXVI. 10 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="151"/>
            what moisture he has to the water, what heat he has to the <lb/>
            fire, and what cold he has to the air.</p>
          <p>These then are the things of the body; but the intellectual and <lb/>
            heavenly race of the soul will ascend to the purest æther as to <lb/>
            its father. For the fifth essence, as the account of the ancients <lb/>
            tells us, may be a certain one, which brings things round in a <lb/>
            cycle, differing from the other four as being superior to them, <lb/>
            from which the stars and the whole heavens appear to be <lb/>
            generated, and of which, as a natural consequence, one must <lb/>
            lay it down that the human soul is a fragment.</p>
          <p>LVIII. And the expression, "After having lived in peace," <lb/>
            is used with much propriety ; because nearly all or the greater <lb/>
            portion of the human race lives rather in war and among all <lb/>
            the evils of war. And of wars, one kind proceeds from external <lb/>
            enemies, and is brought on by want of reputation, and by low­ <lb/>
            ness of origin, and by other things of that kind. But another <lb/>
            kind arises from one's domestic enemies; some about the <lb/>
            body, such as weaknesses, stains, all kinds of mutilations, and <lb/>
            a whole body of other unspeakable evils ; and others affecting <lb/>
            the soul, such as passions, diseases, infirmities, terrible and <lb/>
            most grievous inflictions, and incurable calamities arising from <lb/>
            folly and injustice, and other similar evils.</p>
          <p>Therefore he speaks of him who has lived in peace, who has <lb/>
            enjoyed a serene and tranquil life, as a man truly happy and <lb/>
            blessed. When then shall this happen ? When all external <lb/>
            things prosper with me, in such a way as to tend to my <lb/>
            abundance and to my glory. When the things relating to the <lb/>
            body are in a favourable state, so as to give me good health and <lb/>
            strength ; and when the things relating to my soul are in a <lb/>
            similar state, so as to enable it to enjoy the virtues. For each <lb/>
            of these requires its own appropriate body-guards. Now the <lb/>
            body is attended in that capacity by glory, and abundance, and <lb/>
            a sufficient provision of wealth ; and the soul by the wholeness, <lb/>
            and soundness, and thoroughly healthy state of the body; and <lb/>
            the mind by those speculations which are concerned about the <lb/>
            sciences.</p>
          <p>Since it is plain to all those who are versed in the holy <lb/>
            scriptures, that when peace is here mentioned, it is not that <lb/>
            peace which cities enjoy. For Abraham bore a part in many <lb/>
            terrible wars, out of which he appears to have come tri­ <lb/>
            umphantly. And indeed the being forced to depart from his <lb/>
             <pb n="152"/>
            native country, and to leave his home, and his inability to dwell <lb/>
            in his native city, and his being driven hither and thither, and <lb/>
            wandering about by desolate and unfrequented roads, would <lb/>
            have been a terrible war for one who had not put his trust in <lb/>
            certain divine oracles and promises.</p>
          <p>There was also a third calamity, of a formidable nature, also <lb/>
            to be borne by him, a famine, worse than the departure from <lb/>
            his home, or than all the evils of war. What peace then did <lb/>
            he enjoy? For I imagine to be driven from his former home, <lb/>
            and to have no settled abode, and to be unable to make any <lb/>
            effectual resistance to very powerful monarchs, and to be <lb/>
            oppressed with hunger, seem like indications, not of one war, <lb/>
            but of many wars of various kinds. But, according to those <lb/>
            interpretations which are figurative, every one of these events <lb/>
            is an instance and proof of unalloyed peace. For an absence <lb/>
            of the passions, and a complete scarcity of them, and the <lb/>
            destruction of inimical acts of iniquity, and a departure from <lb/>
            the opinions of the Chaldæans to the doctrine which loves God, <lb/>
            that is to say, from the created being, perceptible by the <lb/>
            outward senses, to the great Cause and Creator of all things, <lb/>
            who is appreciable only by the intellect, are things which <lb/>
            supply a good system of laws and stability.</p>
          <p>ADd God promises the man who enjoys such a peace as this <lb/>
            a glorious old age, not indeed one which shall last an exceeding <lb/>
            time, but he promises him a life with wisdom. For tranquillity <lb/>
            and happiness are better than length of years, in proportion as <lb/>
            a short period of light is better than everlasting darkness. <lb/>
            For well did one of the prophets say : “ He had rather live one <lb/>
            day in company with virtue, than ten thousand years in the <lb/>
            shadow of death ; ”* under this figurative expression of shadow, <lb/>
            intimating the life of the wicked. And Moses says the very <lb/>
            same thing, intimating it by his actions rather than by his <lb/>
            words. For the man who he says shall enjoy a glorious old <lb/>
            age, he has at the same time represented as more short-lived <lb/>
            than almost any one of those who preceded him. Speaking in <lb/>
            a philosophical manner, and teaching us who it is who does <lb/>
            truly enjoy a happy old age, that we may not conceive pride <lb/>
            respecting old age from anything that affects the visible body, <lb/>
            as such pride is full of shame and many disgraceful circum­ <lb/>
            stances. But, that keeping our eyes fixed on wisdom of <note type="footnote"> * Psalm LXXXIV. 11. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="153"/>
            counsel, and steadiness of soul, we may ascribe to such men <lb/>
            and testify in their favour that they have a glorious old age, <lb/>
            (<foreign xml:lang="grc">γη̃ϱας</foreign>) akin to, and bearing nearly the same name as honour <lb/>
            (<foreign xml:lang="grc">γέϱας</foreign>). Listen, therefore, in such a spirit as to think his <lb/>
            words a good lesson, to this statement of the lawgiver, that the <lb/>
            good man alone has a happy old age, and that he is the most <lb/>
            long-lived of men ; but that the wicked man is the most <lb/>
            short-lived of men, living only to die, or rather having already <lb/>
            died as to the life of virtue.</p>
          <p>LIX. In the next verses it is said, " And in the fourth ge­ <lb/>
            neration they shall return hither," not merely in order that <lb/>
            the time may be exactly marked out to him, in which his <lb/>
            descendants shall become inhabitants of the holy land, but <lb/>
            also in order to represent to him the perfect and complete <lb/>
            re-establishment of virtue; and this takes place as it were in <lb/>
            the fourth generation, but how it does so it is worth while to <lb/>
            consider.</p>
          <p>The child, after it is brought forth, during its age of in­ <lb/>
            fancy, till it has completed its first period of seven years, has <lb/>
            a pure unmixed nature, very like a smooth waxen tablet, <lb/>
            which has not yet been stamped with the indelible impressions <lb/>
            of good or evil; for all the things which appear to be engraved <lb/>
            upon it are soon confused and effaced by reason of its mois­ <lb/>
            ture : this is as it were the first age of the soul.</p>
          <p>The second is that which, after the age of infancy is passed, <lb/>
            begins to live among evils, some of which it is also accustomed <lb/>
            to generate from itself, and others it cheerfully receives from <lb/>
            other sources, for the teachers of evil deeds are infinite in <lb/>
            number; nurses, and tutors, and parents, and the laws in dif­ <lb/>
            ferent states, whether written or unwritten, which make ob­ <lb/>
            jects of admiration out of things which ought to be laughed at; <lb/>
            and even without teachers nature itself is easily inclined to <lb/>
            learn what is improper, so as to be continually weighed down <lb/>
            by the abundance of its evils; “For,” says the scripture, <lb/>
            " the mind of man is carefully devoted to evil from his <lb/>
            youth."* This is that most accursed period which is figura­ <lb/>
            tively called an age, but also especially the age of youth, in <lb/>
            which the body is full of youthful vigour, and the soul is puffed <lb/>
            up; the passions, which have hitherto lain hid, being now <note type="footnote"> * Genesis viii. 21. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="154"/>
            fanned into a flame, and burning up the threshing-floors, and <lb/>
            crops, and fields, and whatever they meet with.</p>
          <p>This diseased generation or age must be remedied by some <lb/>
            third age, acting towards it the part of medical philosophy, so <lb/>
            that it shall be charmed with salutary and saving words, by <lb/>
            means of which it will receive an evacuation of the immoderate <lb/>
            satiety of evil actions, and a fulness of a sort of hungry empti­ <lb/>
            ness, and terrible desolation of good deeds. Therefore, after <lb/>
            the application of this cure, there comes first the age, in which <lb/>
            power and vigour grow up in the soul, in accordance with the <lb/>
            most certain comprehension of wisdom, and the undeviating <lb/>
            and solid character which exists in all the virtues. This is <lb/>
            the meaning of the expression, " And in the fourth generation <lb/>
            they shall return hither." For according to the fourth number <lb/>
            thus pointed out the soul, which has turned away from doing <lb/>
            evil, is proclaimed as the inheritor of wisdom; for the first <lb/>
            number is that into which it is not possible to receive any <lb/>
            idea of either good or evil, since the soul is as yet destitute of <lb/>
            all impressions; and the second is that in which we indulge <lb/>
            in a rapid course of the passions; and the third is that in <lb/>
            which we are healed, repelling the infections of disease, and <lb/>
            at last ceasing to feel the evil vigour of the passions; the <lb/>
            fourth is that in which we acquire complete and perfect health <lb/>
            and vigour, when rejecting what is bad we appear to endeavour <lb/>
            to apply to what is good, which previously was not in our <lb/>
            power.</p>
          <p>LX. But up to what time this is to be he tells us himself, <lb/>
            when he says, " For the wickednesses of the Amorites are not <lb/>
            yet fulfilled.”* And such words as these give an occasion to <lb/>
            weaker brethren to fancy, that Moses represents fate and lie­ <lb/>
            cessity as the causes of all things that exist or take place : but <lb/>
            we must not be ignorant that he was well acquainted with the <lb/>
            consequences, and connection, and reciprocal dependence of <lb/>
            the causes of things, inasmuch as he was a philosophical man, <lb/>
            accustomed to converse with God: and he does not attribute <lb/>
            the causes of things which exist, or which take place, to these <lb/>
            powers; for he imagined to himself some other more ancient <lb/>
            power, mounted upon the universe, like a charioteer, or like <lb/>
            the pilot of a ship; for this power steers the whole common <lb/>
            vessel of the world in which all things sail, and he bridles the <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xv. 11. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="155"/>
            course of the winged chariot, the entire heaven, exerting an <lb/>
            independent and absolute sovereign authority. What then are <lb/>
            we to say about these subjects ? The name Amorites, being <lb/>
            interpreted, means " talkers ;" and numbers of those who have <lb/>
            received that greatest of all the blessings bestowed upon man <lb/>
            by nature, namely speech, have abused and corrupted it, em­ <lb/>
            ploying it ungratefully and treacherously, to the injury of her <lb/>
            who has bestowed it. Such are flatterers, impostors, devisers <lb/>
            of plausible sophistries, men who rather cultivate the skill to <lb/>
            delude and to cheat, and who have no care to speak truly, and <lb/>
            these men study indistinctness. Now indistinctness is equiva­ <lb/>
            lent to deep darkness in discourse; and darkness is the great <lb/>
            assistant of robbers, on which account Moses has adorned the <lb/>
            chief priest with distinct demonstration and truth; thinking it <lb/>
            proper that the discourse of the virtuous man should be clear, <lb/>
            and perspicuous, and true; but men in general pursue that <lb/>
            which is indistinct and false, under the banner of which the <lb/>
            whole misguided multitude of ordinary careless men enrols <lb/>
            itself.</p>
          <p>Therefore, as long as " the offences of the Amorites are not <lb/>
            fulfilled, that is to say, the evils of sophistical arguments by <lb/>
            reason of their not having been refuted, but while they still <lb/>
            influence us, having an attractive power by reason of their <lb/>
            plausibility, we being unable to turn away and forsake them, <lb/>
            remain in their power from being allured by them. But if <lb/>
            once all unreal plausibilities are convicted and refuted by true <lb/>
            proofs, and if their offences are shown to be full and running <lb/>
            over, then we shall flee away without ever turning back, and <lb/>
            as it were slipping our cables we shall set sail from the region <lb/>
            of falsehoods and sophistries, hastening to cast anchor in the <lb/>
            safe harbours and havens of truth.</p>
          <p>And in this way, I look upon it as sufficiently proved in the <lb/>
            spirit of my original proposition that it is impossible for a mail <lb/>
            to reject, and to hate, and to forsake plausible falsehood, unless <lb/>
            the evils arising from it are seen to be full and complete; and <lb/>
            they will be shown to be so, by its being refuted in no super­ <lb/>
            ficial way, by the establishment on the other hand, and by the <lb/>
            complete confirmation of truth.</p>
          <p>LXI. In the next verse the historian proceeds to say, “and <lb/>
            when the sun approached its setting, there was a flame;"* <note type="footnote">* Genesis xv. 17. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="156"/>
            showing that virtue is a thing which is not born till late, and <lb/>
            indeed which, as some persons have said, is only confirmed <lb/>
            and established at the very setting of life. And he compares <lb/>
            virtue to a flame; for as the flame consumes whatever <lb/>
            materials are exposed to it, and gives light to all the air in its <lb/>
            neighbourhood, in the same manner does virtue burn up all <lb/>
            the offences, and fills the whole mind with light. But while <lb/>
            discourses, which are neither divided nor properly distributed, <lb/>
            prevail over us by reason of their plausibilities, which he here <lb/>
            calls the Amorites, we are not able to see the most brilliant <lb/>
            and unshaded light. But we are like a furnace which has not <lb/>
            a pure flame, but, as he himself says, emits only smoke, being <lb/>
            gradually kindled by the sparks of knowledge, but not as yet <lb/>
            being able to stand the hardening and test of pure fire.</p>
          <p>But we owe great gratitude to him who has scattered those <lb/>
            sparks, in order that our mind may not become cold like a <lb/>
            lifeless corpse, but being warmed and vivified by the gentle <lb/>
            increasing heat of virtue, may feel a glow until it receives the <lb/>
            change to holy fire, like Nadab and Abihu. But smoke exists <lb/>
            before fire, and compels those who come near it to weep ; but <lb/>
            both fire and smoke often come together. For, being delighted <lb/>
            at the messengers of virtue, we hope to attain perfection <lb/>
            therein, and if we are not yet able to arrive at it, then we can <lb/>
            scarcely through our grief forbear from tears. For when an <lb/>
            excessive desire is implanted in our breasts, they hasten to <lb/>
            pursue the desired object, and our faces are full of chagrin <lb/>
            until we attain it.</p>
          <p>And how he has compared the soul of the man, who loves <lb/>
            instruction and who cherishes a hope of arirving at perfection, <lb/>
            to a furnace, because each is a vessel in which food is cooked, <lb/>
            the one being the vessel in which those meats which are perish­ <lb/>
            able are prepared, and the other that suited to the reception of <lb/>
            the imperishable virtues.</p>
          <p>And the burning torches of fire which are lighted up are the <lb/>
            judgments of God who bears the torch, being bright and <lb/>
            radiant, which are accustomed to be always placed in the <lb/>
            middle between the divided portions; I mean by this the <lb/>
            portions set in opposition to one another, of which the whole <lb/>
            world is composed. For we read in the scripture, " The lamps <lb/>
            of fire which were in the midst between the divided portions,”* <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xv. 17. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="157"/>
            that you may know that the divine powers which go through <lb/>
            the middle of both bodies and things, destroy none of them ; <lb/>
            for both the divisions remain unhurt, but only divide and <lb/>
            discriminate in a most excellent manner between the natures <lb/>
            of each.</p>
          <p>LXII. Therefore, the wise man has now been sufficiently <lb/>
            proved to be the inheritor of the knowledge of the subjects <lb/>
            above mentioned. " For,'' says the historian, “ on that day <lb/>
            the Lord made a covenant with Abraham, saying, to thy seed <lb/>
            will I give this land."* But what land does he mean but that <lb/>
            which has been already mentioned, to which he is now making <lb/>
            reference ? The fruit of which is the safe and most certain <lb/>
            comprehension of the wisdom of God, according to which it <lb/>
            preserves for its dividers all the good things which exist with­ <lb/>
            out any admixture or taint of evil, as if they had been <lb/>
            incorruptible from their very beginning. After this he proceeds <lb/>
            to add, "from the river of Egypt to the great river, the river <lb/>
            Euphrates." Showing that those men who are perfect have <lb/>
            their beginnings in the body, and the outward sense, and the <lb/>
            organic parts, without which we cannot live, for they are <lb/>
            useful for instruction in the life which is in union with the <lb/>
            body ; but they have their end with the wisdom of God, which <lb/>
            is truly the great river, overflowing with joy, and cheerfulness, <lb/>
            and all other blessings. For he has not described the country <lb/>
            as reaching from the river Euphrates to the river of Egypt <lb/>
            (for he would never have brought over virtue towards the <lb/>
            passions of the body), but on the contrary, he has said from the <lb/>
            river of Egypt to the river Euphrates. For the migrations <lb/>
            are from mortal things to things incorruptible.</p>

          </head>
          <p>I. " BUT Sarah the wife of Abraham had not borne him any <lb/>
            child. And she had an Egyptian handmaiden, whose name <lb/>
            was Hagar. And Sarah said unto Abraham, Behold, the Lord <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xv. IS. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="158"/>
            has closed me up, so that I should not bear children; go in <lb/>
            unto my handmaiden that thou mayest have children by her.”* <lb/>
            The name Sarah, being interpreted, means "my princedom." <lb/>
            And the wisdom which is in me, and the temperance which is <lb/>
            in me, and the particular justice, and each of the other virtues <lb/>
            which belong to me alone, are the princedom of me alone. <lb/>
            For such virtue, being a queen from its birth, rules over and <lb/>
            governs me who have determined on obeying it.</p>
          <p>Now this virtue, Moses (making a most paradoxical assertion) <lb/>
            reports, as being both barren and also most prolific, since he <lb/>
            affirms that the most populous of all nations is sprung from it. <lb/>
            For, in real truth, virtue is barren with respect to all things <lb/>
            which are evil, but is so exceedingly prolific of good things, <lb/>
            that it stands in no need of the art of the midwife, for it <lb/>
            anticipates it by bringing forth before its arrival. Therefore <lb/>
            animals and plants, after considerable intervals and inter­ <lb/>
            ruptions, bring forth their appropriate fruits, once, or at most <lb/>
            twice a year ; according to the number of times which nature <lb/>
            has appointed each of them, and which is properly adapted to <lb/>
            the seasons of the year. But virtue without any interruption, <lb/>
            without any interval or any cessation, is continually bringing <lb/>
            forth at all times and on all occasions, not indeed children, but <lb/>
            virtuous reasonings, and irreproachable counsels, and praise­ <lb/>
            worthy actions.</p>
          <p>II. But neither is wealth, which it is not possible to employ, <lb/>
            of any advantage to its possessors, nor is the fertility of wisdom <lb/>
            of any service to us, unless it also brings forth such things as <lb/>
            are serviceable to us. For some persons it judges to be in <lb/>
            every respect worthy of living in its company; but others <lb/>
            appear to have not yet arrived at such an age, as to be able to <lb/>
            support so highly praised and well regulated a charge; whom, <lb/>
            however, it permits to enter upon the preliminaries of marriage, <lb/>
            holding out to them a hope that they may hereafter consummate <lb/>
            the wedlock.</p>
          <p>Sarah therefore, the virtue which rules over my soul, has <lb/>
            brought forth, but, she has not brought forth for me (for I <lb/>
            should never as yet have been able, since I am quite young, <lb/>
            to receive her offspring); she has brought forth, I say, wisdom, <lb/>
            and the doing of just actions, and piety, by reason of the <lb/>
            multitude of illegitimate children whom the vain opinions <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xvi. 1. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="159"/>
            have brought forth to me. For the education of the offspring, <lb/>
            and the constant superintendence and incessant care which <lb/>
            they require, have compelled me to neglect the legitimate <lb/>
            children, who are really citizens. It is well, therefore, to pray <lb/>
            that virtue may not only bring forth, since she is prolific even <lb/>
            without a prayer, but that she also may bring for us ; in <lb/>
            order that we, receiving a share of her seed and of her offspring, <lb/>
            may be happy. For she is accustomed to bring forth children <lb/>
            to God alone, restoring with burning gratitude the first fruits <lb/>
            of all the blessings which she has received, to him, who, as <lb/>
            Moses says, "opened her womb,"* which was at all times <lb/>
            virgin. For he also says that the lamp, that archetypal model <lb/>
            after which the copy is made, shines in one part, that is to say, <lb/>
            in the part which is turned towards God.t For since that <lb/>
            completes the number of seven, and stands in the middle of <lb/>
            the six branches, which are divided into two lots of three each, <lb/>
            acting as body-guards to it on either side, it sends its rays <lb/>
            upwards toward that one being, namely God, thinking its light <lb/>
            too brilliant for mortal sight to be able to stand its proximity.</p>
          <p>III. On this account he does not say that Sarah did not <lb/>
            bring forth at all, but only that she did not bring forth for him, <lb/>
            for Abraham. For we are not as yet capable of becoming the <lb/>
            fathers of the offspring of virtue, unless we first of all have a <lb/>
            connection with her handmaiden; and the handmaiden of <lb/>
            wisdom is the encyclical knowledge of music and logic, arrived <lb/>
            at by previous instruction. For as in houses there are vesti­ <lb/>
            bules placed in front of staircases, and as in cities there are <lb/>
            suburbs, through which one must pass in order to enter into <lb/>
            the cities ; so also the encyclical branches of instruction are <lb/>
            placed in front of virtue, for they are the road which conducts <lb/>
            to her. And as you must know that it is common for there to <lb/>
            be great preludes to great propositions, and the greatest of all <lb/>
            propositions is virtue, for it is conversant about the most <lb/>
            important of all materials, namely, about the universal life of <lb/>
            man; very naturally, therefore, that will not employ any short <lb/>
            preface, but rather it will use as such, grammar, geometry, <lb/>
            astronomy, rhetoric, music, and all the other sorts of contem­ <lb/>
            plation which proceed in accordance with reason; of which <lb/>
            Hagar, the handmaid of Sarah, is an emblem, as we will <lb/>
            proceed to show. <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xxix. 31. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Exodus xxv. 31. </note> <pb n="160"/>
            </p>
          <p>" For Sarah," says Moses, "said unto Abraham, Behold, the <lb/>
            Lord has closed me up, so that I may not bear children. Go <lb/>
            in unto my handmaiden, that thou mayest have children by <lb/>
            her." Now, we must take out of the present discussion those <lb/>
            conjunctions and connections of body with body which have <lb/>
            pleasure for their end. For this is the connection of the mind <lb/>
            with virtue, which is desirous to have children by her, and <lb/>
            which, if it cannot do so at once, is at all events taught to <lb/>
            espouse her handmaid, namely, intermediate instruction.</p>
          <p>IV, And here it is worth while to admire wisdom, by reason <lb/>
            of its modesty, which has not thought fit to reproach us with <lb/>
            the slowness of our generation, or our absolute barrenness. <lb/>
            And this, too, though the oracle says truly that she brought <lb/>
            forth no child, not out of envy, but because of the unsuitable­ <lb/>
            ness of our own selves. For, says she, " The Lord has closed <lb/>
            me up so, that I may not bear children." And she no longer <lb/>
            adds the words, " to you," that she may not appear to mention <lb/>
            the misfortunes of others, or to reproach them with theirs. <lb/>
            '' Therefore," says she, " go thou in to my handmaiden," that <lb/>
            is to say, to the intermediate instruction of the intermediate <lb/>
            and encyclical branches of knowledge, " that you may first have <lb/>
            children by her;" for hereafter you shall be able to enjoy a <lb/>
            connection with her mistress, tending to the procreation of <lb/>
            legitimate children. For grammar, by teaching you the <lb/>
            histories which are to be found in the works of the poets and <lb/>
            historians, will give you intelligence and abundant learning; <lb/>
            and, moreover, will teach you to look with contempt on all the <lb/>
            vain fables which erroneous opinions invent, on account of the <lb/>
            ill success which history tells us that the heroes and demigods <lb/>
            who are celebrated among those writers, meet with.</p>
          <p>And music will teach what is inharmonious in the way of <lb/>
            rhythm, and what is ill arranged in harmony, and, rejecting all <lb/>
            that is out of tune and all that is inconsistent with melody, <lb/>
            will guide what was previously discordant to concord. And <lb/>
            geometry, sowing the seeds of equality and just proportion in <lb/>
            the soul, which is fond of learning, will, by means of the beauty <lb/>
            of continued contemplation, implant in you an admiration of <lb/>
            justice. And rhetoric, having sharpened the mind for <lb/>
            contemplation in general, and having exercised and trained the <lb/>
            faculties of speech in interpretation and explanation, will make <lb/>
            man really rational, taking care of that peculiar and especial <lb/>
             <pb n="161"/>
            duty which nature has bestowed upon it, but upon no other <lb/>
            animal whatever. And dialectic science, which is the sister, <lb/>
            the twin sister of rhetoric, as some persons have called it, <lb/>
            separating true from false arguments, and refuting the <lb/>
            plausibilities of sophistical arguments, will cure the great <lb/>
            disease of the soul, deceit.</p>
          <p>It is profitable, therefore, to abide among these and other <lb/>
            sciences resembling them, and to devote one's especial atten­ <lb/>
            tion to them. For perhaps, I say, as has happened to <lb/>
            many, we shall become known to the queenly virtues by <lb/>
            means of their subjects and handmaidens. Do you not see <lb/>
            that our bodies do not use solid and costly food before they <lb/>
            have first, in their age of infancy, used such as had no variety, <lb/>
            and consisted merely of milk ? And, in the same way, think <lb/>
            also that infantine food is prepared for the soul, namely the <lb/>
            encyclical sciences, and the contemplations which are directed <lb/>
            to each of them ; but that the more perfect and becoming <lb/>
            food, namely the virtues, is prepared for those who are really <lb/>
            full-grown men.</p>
          <p>V. Now the first characteristics of the intermediate instruc­ <lb/>
            tion are represented by two symbols, the race and the name. <lb/>
            As to race, the handmaiden is an Egyptian, and her name is <lb/>
            Hagar ; and this name, being interpreted, means "emigration." <lb/>
            For it follows of necessity that the man who delights in the <lb/>
            encyclical contemplations, and who joins himself as a <lb/>
            companion to varied learning, is as such enrolled under the <lb/>
            banners of the earthly and Egyptian body ; and that he stands <lb/>
            in need of eyes in order to see and to read, and of ears in order <lb/>
            to attend and to hear, and of his other external senses, in such <lb/>
            a manner as to be able to unfold each of the objects of the <lb/>
            external sense. For it is not natural to suppose that the <lb/>
            subject of judgment can possibly be comprehended without <lb/>
            some power which is to judge ; and the power which judges <lb/>
            of the objects of the external sense is the external sense, so <lb/>
            that without the external sense it would not be possible for any <lb/>
            thing in that world which is perceptible by the external sense <lb/>
            to be accurately known, though those are the matters which are <lb/>
            the principal field for philosophical speculation.</p>
          <p>But the external sense, being that portion of the soul which <lb/>
            most resembles the body, is deeply rooted in the entire vessel <lb/>
            of the soul; and the vessel of the soul is, by a figurative way <note type="footnote"> VOL. II. </note> <note type="footnote"> M </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="162"/>
            of speaking, called Egypt. And there is this one characteristic <lb/>
            derived from her race, which the handmaiden of virtue <lb/>
            possesses. But what or what kind of characteristic that is <lb/>
            which is derived from the name, we must now proceed to <lb/>
            consider.</p>
          <p>The intermediate instruction has the same rank and classi­ <lb/>
            fication as a sojourner. For all knowledge, and wisdom, and <lb/>
            virtue, are the only real native and original inhabitants and <lb/>
            citizens of the universe. And all the other kinds of instruction, <lb/>
            which obtain the second, and third, and lowest honours, are on <lb/>
            the confines, between foreigners and citizens. For they are <lb/>
            not connected with either race without some alloy, and yet <lb/>
            again they are connected with both according to a certain <lb/>
            community and participation. For they are sojourners from <lb/>
            the fact of their passing their time among citizens; but from <lb/>
            the fact of their not being settled inhabitants, they also <lb/>
            resemble foreigners. In the same manner, according to my <lb/>
            idea, as adopted children, inasmuch as they inherit the <lb/>
            property of those who have adopted them, resemble real <lb/>
            legitimate children ; but inasmuch as they were not begotten <lb/>
            by them, they resemble strangers. The same relation, then, <lb/>
            that a mistress has to her handmaidens, or a wife, who is a <lb/>
            cititzn, to a concubine, that same relation has virtue, that is <lb/>
            Sarah, to education, that is Hagar. So that very naturally, <lb/>
            since the husband, by name Abraham, is one who has an <lb/>
            admiration for contemplation and knowledge ; virtue, that is <lb/>
            Sarah, would be his wife, and Hagar, that is all kinds of <lb/>
            encylical accomplishment, would be his concubine. Whoever, <lb/>
            therefore, has acquired wisdom from his teachers, would never <lb/>
            reject Hagar. For the acquisition of all the preliminary <lb/>
            branches of education is wholly necessary.</p>
          <p>VI. But if any one, having determined on perseveringly <lb/>
            enduring labours in the cause of virtue, devotes himself to <lb/>
            continued study, practising and meditating without intermis­ <lb/>
            sion, that man will marry two citizens, and also an equal <lb/>
            number of concubines, the handmaidens of the citizens. And <lb/>
            each of these has a different appearance and a different nature. <lb/>
            For instance, of the two citizen wives, one is a most healthy <lb/>
            and well established and peaceful motion, whom from the <lb/>
            circumstances the historians called Leah: and the other <lb/>
            resembles a whetstone and is called Rachel, in the pursuit of <lb/>
             <pb n="163"/>
            whom the mind, which is fond of labour and fond of exercises, <lb/>
            is much sharpened. and excited ; and the name, being inter­ <lb/>
            preted, means the .. sight of profanation ;˙’ not because she sees <lb/>
            profanely, but, on the contrary, because she thinks the things <lb/>
            which are seen and which are the objects of the external <lb/>
            senses, not brilliant but common and profane in comparison of <lb/>
            the pure and untainted nature of those things which are invi­ <lb/>
            sible and which are only discernible by the intellect.</p>
          <p>For since our soul is composed of two parts, and since the one <lb/>
            contains the rational faculties, and the other the irrational ones, <lb/>
            it follows that each part must have its own peculiar virtue, Leah <lb/>
            being the virtue of the rational part, and Rachel of the irra­ <lb/>
            tional. For the one trains us, by means of the external senses <lb/>
            and the parts of speech, to look contemptuously upon all things <lb/>
            which it is proper to disregard, such as glory, and wealth, and <lb/>
            pleasure, which the principal and general multitude of common <lb/>
            men look upon as things to be admired and striven for, their <lb/>
            sense of hearing being corrupted, and the tribunal of all the <lb/>
            other external senses being corrupted likewise. But the other <lb/>
            teaches us to turn away from that uneven and rough road <lb/>
            which is never approached by souls that love virtue, and to go <lb/>
            smoothly along the smooth road without any stumbling and <lb/>
            without meeting any hindrances in the path. Therefore the <lb/>
            handmaiden of the former of the two citizen wives will neces­ <lb/>
            sarily be the power of interpretation as exercised by means of <lb/>
            the organs of speech, and also the rational invention of <lb/>
            sophisms, deceiving man by a well-imagined plausibility ; <lb/>
            and its necessary nourishment is meat and drink.</p>
          <p>The historian has recorded for us the names of the two <lb/>
            handmaidens, calling them Zilpah and Billah.* The name <lb/>
            Zilpah, being interpreted, means "a mouth going forth," a <lb/>
            symbol of that nature which interprets and speaks. But <lb/>
            Billah means “ a swallowing," which is the first and most <lb/>
            necessary support of all mortal animals. For it is by swallow­ <lb/>
            ing that our bodies are established firmly, and the cables of <lb/>
            life are attached to this action as to a sure foundation. Accord­ <lb/>
            ingly the practiser of virtue lives with all the aforesaid powers, <lb/>
            with some as with free women and citizens, and with others <lb/>
            as slaves and concubines. For he is enamoured of the motion <lb/>
            of Leah; and a smooth (<foreign xml:lang="grc">λεία</foreign>) motion existing in a body would <note type="footnote"> Genesis xxx. 1. </note> <note type="footnote"> M a </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="164"/>
            be calculated to produce health, and, when existing in a soul, it <lb/>
            would produce virtue and justice. But he loves Rachel, wrest­ <lb/>
            ling with his passions, and preparing himself for a struggle <lb/>
            of temperance, arraying himself in opposition to all the objects <lb/>
            of the external senses. For there are two kinds of advantage, <lb/>
            either that according to which we enjoy blessings, as in peace, <lb/>
            or else that which comes from arraying one's self in opposition <lb/>
            to and from removing evils as in war. Now Leah is the <lb/>
            wife according to whom it happens to the husband to enjoy <lb/>
            the elder, and more important, and dominant blessings; and <lb/>
            Rachel the wife, according to whom he obtains what resemble <lb/>
            the sports of war. Such then is his way, if left with his <lb/>
            citizen wives.</p>
          <p>But the practiser of virtue also wants Billah, that is, swallow­ <lb/>
            ing, but as a slave and a concubine ; for without food and <lb/>
            vitality, living well could not possibly be the lot of the mail, <lb/>
            since things indifferent are always the foundation of what is <lb/>
            better; and he also wants Zilpah, that is to say, interpre­ <lb/>
            tation by means of utterance, in order that the rational part <lb/>
            itself may, in a twofold manner, contribute to perfection, both <lb/>
            from the fountain existing in the intellect, and also from the <lb/>
            stream flowing therefrom in the organ of the voice.</p>
          <p>VII. But these men were husbands of many wives and con­ <lb/>
            cubines, not only of such as were citizens, as the sacred <lb/>
            scriptures tell us. But Isaac had neither many wives nor any <lb/>
            concubine at all, but only his first and wedded wife, who lived <lb/>
            with him all his life. Why was this? Because the virtue <lb/>
            acquired by teaching, which Abraham pursues, requires many <lb/>
            things, both such as are legitimate according to prudence, and <lb/>
            such also as are illegitimate according to the exegetical con­ <lb/>
            templations of preliminary instruction. And there is also a <lb/>
            virtue which is made perfect by practice, to which Jacob ap­ <lb/>
            pears to have been devoted; for exercises consist of many and <lb/>
            various dogmas and doctrines, some leading and others follow­ <lb/>
            ing, some leading the way, and others arriving later, and <lb/>
            bringing at one time more serious, and at other times lighter <lb/>
            labours. But the self-instructed race, of which Isaac was a <lb/>
            partaker, the excellent country of the mastery over the pas­ <lb/>
            sions, has received as its share a nature simple, and unmixed, <lb/>
            and unalloyed, standing in no need of either practice or <lb/>
            instruction in which there is Deed of the concubine sciences, <lb/>
             <pb n="165"/>
            and not only of the citizen wives,; for when God has showered <lb/>
            down from above that most requisite benefit of knowledge, self- <lb/>
            taught, and having no need of a preceptor, it would be <lb/>
            impossible any longer for a man to live with the slavish and <lb/>
            concubine arts, having a desire for bastard doctrines as his <lb/>
            children.</p>
          <p>For the man who has arrived at this honour, is inscribed as <lb/>
            the husband of the mistress and princess virtue; and she is <lb/>
            called in the Greek language, perseverance, but among the <lb/>
            Hebrews her name is Rebekkah. For he who, by reason of <lb/>
            the happy constitution of his own nature and by the prolific <lb/>
            fertility of his soul, has attained to wisdom without encounter­ <lb/>
            ing labour or enduring hardship, stands in need of no further <lb/>
            improvement; for he has at hand the perfect gifts of God, <lb/>
            inspired by means of those most ancient graces, and he wishes <lb/>
            and prays that they may remain lasting. In reference to <lb/>
            which, it appears to me to be that the Author of all goodness <lb/>
            gave him perseverance as his wife, in order that his mercies <lb/>
            might endure for ever to the man'who had her for his wife.</p>
          <p>VIII. Now recollection only comes in the second rank after <lb/>
            memory, as inferior to it; and he who recollects is inferior to him <lb/>
            who remembers ; for the latter resembles a man in an uninter­ <lb/>
            rupted state of good health, but the other is like a man recover­ <lb/>
            ing from a disease, for forgetfulness is a disease of the memory ; <lb/>
            and it follows inevitably that the man who exerts his recollec­ <lb/>
            tion has previously forgotten what he now recollects. There­ <lb/>
            fore the sacred scriptures call memory Ephraim, which name, <lb/>
            being interpreted, means “fruit-bearing.” But the Hebrews <lb/>
            call recollection, after forgetfulness, Manasseh ; for, in good <lb/>
            truth, the soul of the man who remembers does bear as fruit <lb/>
            the things which he has learned, losing nothing of them ; but <lb/>
            the soul of the man who exerts recollection, is only escaping <lb/>
            from forgetfulness, by which it was detained before it recol­ <lb/>
            lected ; therefore a citizen wife, memory, lives with the man <lb/>
            who is endowed with remembrance. But the concubine <lb/>
            recollection, a Syrian by birth, insolent and overbearing, lives <lb/>
            with the man who forgets: for the meaning of the name <lb/>
            Syria, is “sublimity;” and the son of the concubine recol­ <lb/>
            lection is Machir, as the Hebrews call him; but the Greeks <lb/>
            interpret the name to mean " of the father." For those who <lb/>
            recollect a thing think that the mind is the father and cause <lb/>
            of their recollecting, and do not consider that this same en­ <lb/>
             <pb n="166"/>
            dowment of the mind did also before contain " forgetfulncss,” <lb/>
            though it never would have received it if it had had memory <lb/>
            in its power.</p>
          <p>For it is said in the scripture, " And the sons of Manasseh <lb/>
            were Ashriel whom site bare, but his concubine, the Aramitess, <lb/>
            bare Machir; and Machir was the father of Gilead."* And <lb/>
            Nachor, also, the brother of Abraham, had two wives, one <lb/>
            a citizen and the other a concubine. And the name of <lb/>
            the citizen was Milcah; and the name of the concubine <lb/>
            was Rumah. But let no one who is in his senses suspect <lb/>
            that the wise legislator recorded this as a historical genea­ <lb/>
            log but it is rather an explanation of things which are <lb/>
            able to benefit the soul by means of symbols. And when we <lb/>
            have translated the names into our own language, we shall <lb/>
            understand the real meanings intended to be conveyed by <lb/>
            them. Come, then, let us now investigate each of them.</p>
          <p>II. The name Nachor, being interpreted, means " a rest <lb/>
            from light;" and Milcah means “princess;” and Rumah <lb/>
            means "she who sees something." Therefore, to have light in <lb/>
            the mind is good; but cessation from light, and tranquillity, <lb/>
            and immobility is not perfect good, for it is advantageous to <lb/>
            have evils tranquil, but it is desirable to have blessings in <lb/>
            motion ; for what advantage is there in a man's having a tune­ <lb/>
            ful voice, if he keeps silent? or in his having the skill of a <lb/>
            flute player, if he does not play the flute ? or of his knowing <lb/>
            the harp, if he does not strike it? or, in short, what good is <lb/>
            there in any artist whatever, if he does not exercise his art? <lb/>
            for theoretical knowledge, without putting it in practice, is of <lb/>
            no advantage whatever to those who possess it. For a man, <lb/>
            though skilful in the contest of the pancratium, or in boxing, <lb/>
            or in wrestling, would derive no advantage from his athletic <lb/>
            prowess if his hands were tied behind him; and he who was <lb/>
            thoroughly practised in running would derive no advantage <lb/>
            from his fleetness of foot if he were afflicted with the gout, or <lb/>
            if he were to meet with any other injury to his feet. And the <lb/>
            light of the soul, which is the most brilliant and the most like <lb/>
            the sun, is knowledge ; for as the eyes are lightened up by <lb/>
            beams, so is the mind made brilliant by wisdom, and becomes <lb/>
            gradually accustomed to see more acutely from being conti­ <lb/>
            nually anointed with new speculations.</p>
          <p>Therefore, Nachor is interpreted " a cessation from light," <note type="footnote"> * 1 Chronicles vii. 14. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="167"/>
            very naturally; for, inasmuch as he is a relation of the wise <lb/>
            Abraham, he partakes of that light which is according to <lb/>
            wisdom; but inasmuch as he did not join him in his emigra­ <lb/>
            tion from the created to the uncreated being, from the world <lb/>
            to the Creator of the world, he has acquired only a lame and <lb/>
            imperfect knowledge, intermittent and delaying, or rather put <lb/>
            together like a lifeless statue ; for he does not depart and quit <lb/>
            his abode in the Chaldæan country, that is to say, he does not <lb/>
            separate himself from the speculations concerning astronomy ; <lb/>
            honouring that which is created rather than him who created it, <lb/>
            and the world in preference to God; or rather, I should say, <lb/>
            looking on the world itself as an absolute independent God, <lb/>
            and not as the work of an absolute God.</p>
          <p>X. And he takes Milcah for his wife, not being some queen <lb/>
            who by the dispensations of fortune governs some nation of <lb/>
            men, or some city, but only one who bears a common name, <lb/>
            the same as here. For, just as a person would not be widely <lb/>
            wrong who called the world, as being the most excellent of all <lb/>
            created things, the king of the objects of the external sense ; <lb/>
            so, also, one may call the knowledge which is conversant about <lb/>
            the heaven, which knowledge those who study astronomy and <lb/>
            the Chaldæans possess in an eminent degree, the queen of all the <lb/>
            sciences. This, therefore, is the wife who is a citizen ; but <lb/>
            the concubine is she who sees one only of all existing things <lb/>
            at a time, even though it may be the most worthless of all. <lb/>
            It is given, therefore, to the most excellent race to see the <lb/>
            most excellent of things, namely, the really living God ; for <lb/>
            the name Israel, being interpreted, means “ seeing God."</p>
          <p>But to him who aims at the second prize, it is allowed to see <lb/>
            that which is second best, namely, the heaven which is percep­ <lb/>
            tible by the external senses, and the harmonious arrangement <lb/>
            of the stars therein, and their truly musical and well-regulated <lb/>
            motion. The third class are the sceptics, who do not apply <lb/>
            themselves to the most excellent objects, either of the intellect <lb/>
            or of the external senses, which exist in nature, because they <lb/>
            are always occupying themselves with petty sophistries, and <lb/>
            small cavils, and criticisms. These have for their companions <lb/>
            the concubine Rumah, who sees. something which is very <lb/>
            minute, because they are unable to approach the investigation <lb/>
            of better things, by means of which they might benefit their <lb/>
            own life. For, as among physicians that which is called <lb/>
             <pb n="168"/>
            theoretical medical skill, is a long way from doing any good to <lb/>
            those that are sick-for diseases are cured by medicines, and <lb/>
            by operations, and by regimen, and not by discussions or <lb/>
            theories; so also in philosophy, there is a set of worcl­ <lb/>
            traffickers and word-eaters, who have neither the will nor the <lb/>
            skill to heal a life which is full of infirmities, but who, from <lb/>
            their very earliest infancy to the extremity of old age, are not <lb/>
            ashamed to cavil, and quibble, and wrangle about figurative <lb/>
            expressions, as if happiness consisted in an interminable and <lb/>
            profitless minuteness of accuracy in the matter of nouns and <lb/>
            verbs, and not rn the improving and ameliorating the moral <lb/>
            character, the true fountain of the persons' disposition; and in <lb/>
            expelling the vices, and driving them out of its boundaries, <lb/>
            and establishing the virtues as settlers within them.</p>
          <p>XI. Now the wicked also have a desire for concubines, that <lb/>
            is, for vain opinions and doctrines ; accordingly Moses tells us <lb/>
            that Thimna, the concubine of Eliphah the son of Esau, <lb/>
            bore Amalek to Eliphah. * Alas, for the eminent ignobleness <lb/>
            of the descendant! And you will see this ignobleness the <lb/>
            more clearly, if you abandon the idea that this expression is <lb/>
            used about a man, and rather consider the soul, with a kind of <lb/>
            anatomical dissection. The historian then calls the irrational <lb/>
            and immoderate desires and impetuosity of the passions, <lb/>
            Amalek ; now the name Amalek, being interpreted, means <lb/>
            " the people looking up." For as the power of fire consumes <lb/>
            the materials which are offered to it, so in the same manner <lb/>
            does passion, when boiling over lick up and destroy everything <lb/>
            with which it meets. And the father of this passion is very <lb/>
            properly described as Eliphah; for this name, being interpreted, <lb/>
            means " God has scattered me." But does it not follow that <lb/>
            when God scatters, and disperses, and discards the soul, banish­ <lb/>
            ing it from himself, irrational passion is at once engendered ? <lb/>
            For He plants the mind which can really behold him, and which <lb/>
            is really attached to God, the vine of a good kind, stretching <lb/>
            out its roots so as to make them everlasting, and giving it abun­ <lb/>
            dance of fruit for the acquisition and enjoyment of the virtues. <lb/>
            On which account Moses prays, saying, ., Bring them in and <lb/>
            plant them in,” † in order that those divine shoots may not be <lb/>
            ephemeral, but long-lived and lasting for ever and ever.</p>
          <p>And banishing the unjust and ungodly soul, he disperses it <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xxxvi. 12. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Exodus xv. IT. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="169"/>
            and drives it to a distance from himself to the region of the <lb/>
            pleasures and appetites and acts of injustice; and this region <lb/>
            is, with exceeding appropriateness, called the region of the <lb/>
            impious, more fitly thau that one which is fabled as existing in <lb/>
            the shades below. For indeed, the real hell is the life of the <lb/>
            wicked, which is audacious, and flagitious, and liable to all <lb/>
            kinds of curses.</p>
          <p>XII. There is also in another place the following sentence <lb/>
            deeply engraven : “ When the Most High came down to scatter <lb/>
            the nations, as he dispersed the sons of Adam,"* he drove out <lb/>
            all earthly dispositions, which had no desire to see any good <lb/>
            thing from heaven; depriving them of house and city, and <lb/>
            rendering them truly wanderers on the face of the earth. <lb/>
            For no house, nor city, nor anything else which relates to society <lb/>
            and participation, is preserved for any one of the wicked ; <lb/>
            but they are deprived of all settled habitation, and dispersed <lb/>
            abroad, being moved in every direction, and living a life of <lb/>
            continued emigration, and not being able to become settled any <lb/>
            where. Therefore the wicked man has for his children, wicked­ <lb/>
            ness, by his wife who is a citizen, and passion by his concubine ; <lb/>
            for the whole soul, like a free citizen, is a companion of reason, <lb/>
            but that which is open to reproach brings forth wickedness. <lb/>
            But the nature of the body is a concubine, by means of whom <lb/>
            the birth of the passion is beheld ; and the body is the region <lb/>
            of the pleasures and passions, and it is called Thamnali, which <lb/>
            name, being interpreted, signifies a “fluctuating abandonment." <lb/>
            For the soul becomes faint and powerless by reason of the <lb/>
            passions having received much tossing about and agitation <lb/>
            from the body, on account of the violent storm which bursts <lb/>
            forth from immoderate impetuosity.</p>
          <p>But as the head is the chief of all the aforementioned parts of <lb/>
            an animal, so is Esau the chief of this race, whose name is at one <lb/>
            time interpreted " an oak," and at another, " a thing made.” It <lb/>
            is interpreted an oak, in reference to his being unbending, and <lb/>
            implacable, and obstinate, and stiff-necked by nature, and <lb/>
            having folly for his chief fellow counsellor, and being as such <lb/>
            of a truly oaken character. And it is interpreted “ a thing made," <lb/>
            inasmuch as a life according to folly is an invention and a <lb/>
            fable, full of tragic pomp and vain boasting ; and, on the other <lb/>
            hand, of mockery and comic ridicule, having in it nothing <note type="footnote"> * Deuteronomy xxxii. 8. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="170"/>
            sound, being full of falsehood, having utterly cast off truth, and <lb/>
            disregarding as a thing of no value, that nature which is void <lb/>
            of distinctive qualities, or of particular species, but plain and <lb/>
            sincere, which the practiser of virtue loves. And Meses bears <lb/>
            witness to this. when he says that " Jacob was a man without <lb/>
            artifice, dwelling in a house;”* so that he who is contrary to <lb/>
            him, must necessarily be destitute of a house, the companion <lb/>
            of invention, and of things made, and of fabulous nonsense, <lb/>
            or rather bring himself a theatre and a fable.</p>
          <p>XIII. The connection therefore between the reason which <lb/>
            is devoted to contemplation and those powers which are <lb/>
            citizen wines, or concubines, has here been explained to the <lb/>
            best of my power. We must now proceed to investigate <lb/>
            what follows, and endeavour to frame a proper connection <lb/>
            for an argument. “ Abraham, " says the sacred historian, <lb/>
            "listened to the voice of Sarah.”† For it is necessary for <lb/>
            him who is a learner to be obedient to the injunctions of <lb/>
            virtue : but yet all men are not so obedient, hut only those <lb/>
            who are inspired with an exceedingly vehement love for <lb/>
            knowledge. Since almost every day the places where there is <lb/>
            anything to hear and the theatres are crowded, and those who <lb/>
            study philosophy go on without ever stopping to take breath in <lb/>
            one long continued discussion about virtue. But still what <lb/>
            advantage is derived from all that is said? For men, instead <lb/>
            of attending, turn their mind in other directions, some to <lb/>
            marine and mercantile affairs, others to rents and agriculture ; <lb/>
            some to public honours and affairs of state, some to the gains <lb/>
            to be derived from each different profession and art, others to <lb/>
            revenging themselves upon their enemies, others again to the <lb/>
            enjoyments to be derived from the indulgence of the amorous <lb/>
            appetites, and in short every body is under the influence of <lb/>
            some distracting idea or other: so that, as far as the subjects <lb/>
            of the discussion are concerned, they are completely deaf, and <lb/>
            are present with their bodies only, but are at a distance as to <lb/>
            their minds, being in no particular different from images or <lb/>
            statues. And if any persons do attend, they sit all that time <lb/>
            only listening, and when they have departed they do not <lb/>
            recollect a word of what has been said, but they have come <lb/>
            in fact rather to be pleased through the medium of their <lb/>
            hearing than with the view of deriving any solid advantage ; <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xxv. 27. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Genesis xvi 2. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="171"/>
            so that their soul has not been able to comprehend any­ <lb/>
            thing or to become pregnant with any new idea. and even the <lb/>
            cause which at first excited their pleasure soon ceases and <lb/>
            their attention is extinguished.</p>
          <p>There is a third kind of persons to whom what is said is <lb/>
            for a time attended to and remembered, as if still sounding in <lb/>
            their ears: but still they are found to be sophists rather than <lb/>
            philosophers : of these men the language indeed is praiseworthy <lb/>
            but the life is blameable ; for they are powerful at speaking, <lb/>
            but have no ability to do what is best. It is therefore hardly <lb/>
            possible to find a man who is inclined to attend and endowed <lb/>
            with a good memory, honouring deeds rather than words ; as is <lb/>
            testified to in the praise of the man fond of hearing in the <lb/>
            the words, “ He listened to the voice of Sarah." For he is <lb/>
            not represented merely as hearing but also as listening to : <lb/>
            and this last is a particularly felicitous expression to indicate <lb/>
            one who approves of and is influenced by what he hears.</p>
          <p>And the expression, " to the voice," is not inconsiderately or <lb/>
            incorrectly used in preference to saying-he listened to Sarah <lb/>
            speaking. For it is the especial character of a learner to <lb/>
            listen to the voice and words of his teacher: for by these alone <lb/>
            is he taught. But he who acquires what is good by practice, <lb/>
            and solitary meditation, and not by instruction, does not <lb/>
            attend to what is said but rather to those who say it, imitating <lb/>
            the lives of those men in their actions which are in each parti­ <lb/>
            cular irreproachable. For it is said, in the case of Jacob when <lb/>
            he was sent away to form a marriage among his kinsmen, .. Jacob <lb/>
            listened to his mother and his father, and went into Mesopo­ <lb/>
            tamia. "* He listened not to their voice, nor to their words, <lb/>
            for it was fitting that he who was an imitator of their actions <lb/>
            should be a practiser of virtue not a listener to speeches. <lb/>
            For this is the peculiar character of one who is being taught, <lb/>
            but the other is the mark of one who is enduring labours, in <lb/>
            order that from this instance we may comprehend the <lb/>
            difference between a practiser and a learner, the one being regu­ <lb/>
            lated with regard to him who is speaking, and the other wtih <lb/>
            regard to his speech.</p>
          <p>XIV. Therefore, continues the sacred historian, Sarah, the <lb/>
            wife of Abraham, having taken Hagar, the Egyptian woman, <lb/>
            her own handmaiden, ten years after Abraham had begun to <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xxviii. 7. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="172"/>
            dwell in the land of Canaan, gave her to Abraham her <lb/>
            " husband, to be his wife.”* Wickedness is by nature an <lb/>
            envious, and bitter, and evil disposed thing, but virtue is <lb/>
            gentle, and inclined to communion, and friendly; wishing in <lb/>
            every possible manner to benefit those who are well disposed, <lb/>
            either by its own power or by the means of others. So now <lb/>
            accordingly, as we are not able to become the fathers of <lb/>
            children by prudence, she espouses us to her own handmaiden, <lb/>
            encyclical instruction, as I have said before, and all but <lb/>
            endures to be the bridesmaid and manager of the marriage ; <lb/>
            for it is said that Sarah herself took this woman and gave her <lb/>
            to her own husband.</p>
          <p>And here it is worth while to raise the question why it is <lb/>
            that now again Moses calls the wife of Abraham Sarah, when he <lb/>
            had already repeatedly told us what her name was before ; for <lb/>
            he was not a writer who ever indulged in that worst description <lb/>
            of prolixity, tautology. What, then, are we to say? Since <lb/>
            she is about to betroth to him the handmaiden of wisdom, <lb/>
            encyclical instruction, he says that she did not forget the duty <lb/>
            which she owed to her mistress, but knew that she was, both <lb/>
            in law and in her master's feelings, his wife, and that she her­ <lb/>
            self was only such because of necessity and the force of oppor­ <lb/>
            tunity. And this happens to every man who is fond of <lb/>
            learning. And he who has experienced it may be looked upon <lb/>
            as the most trustworthy witness to this fact. At all events I, <lb/>
            when I was first excited by the stimulus of philosophy to feel <lb/>
            a desire for it, when 1 was very young connected myself with <lb/>
            one of her handmaidens, namely, grammar; and all the <lb/>
            offspring of which I became the father by her, such as writing, <lb/>
            reading, and the acquaintance with the works of the poets and <lb/>
            historians, I attributed to the mistress. And at a subsequent <lb/>
            time, forming connection with another of her handmaidens, <lb/>
            geometry, and admiring her beauty (for she had beautiful <lb/>
            symmetry and proportions in all her parts), I still appropriated <lb/>
            none of the offspring, but carried them to the citizen wife, and <lb/>
            bestowed them on her. I was desirous also to form a similar <lb/>
            connection with a third, and she was full of good rhythm, <lb/>
            well arranged, and well limbed, and was called music. And <lb/>
            by her I became the parent of diatonic, and chromatic, <lb/>
            and harmonic, and combined and separate melodies, and <lb/>
            all the different concords belonging to fourths and to fifths, <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xvi. 3. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="173"/>
            and to the diapason. And, again, I concealed none of all <lb/>
            these things, in order that my legitimate citizen wife might <lb/>
            become wealthy, being ministered unto by a multitude of ten <lb/>
            thousand servants; for some men, being attracted by the <lb/>
            charms of handmaidens, have neglected their true mistress, <lb/>
            philosophy, and have grown old, some in poetry, and others in <lb/>
            the study of painting, and others in the mixture of colours, <lb/>
            and others in ten thousand other pursuits, without ever being <lb/>
            able to return to the proper mistress ; for each act has its own <lb/>
            peculiar brilliancies, certain attractive powers, by which some <lb/>
            persons are allured and overcome, forgetting all the covenants <lb/>
            which they have made with philosophy ; but he who abides by <lb/>
            the agreements which he has made, provides every thing from <lb/>
            all quarters with a view to pleasing her.</p>
          <p>Very appropriately, therefore, does the sacred scripture, <lb/>
            admiring his good faith in respect of his legitimate wife, say <lb/>
            that even now Sarah was his true wife, inasmuch as he only <lb/>
            took his handmaid into his bed out of complaisance towards <lb/>
            her; and, indeed, in the same manner as the encyclical <lb/>
            branches of education contribute to the proper comprehension <lb/>
            of philosophy, so also does philosophy aid in the acquisition of <lb/>
            wisdom; for philosophy is an attentive study of wisdom, and <lb/>
            wisdom is the knowledge of all divine and human things, and <lb/>
            of the respective causes of them. Therefore, just as encyclical <lb/>
            accomplishments are the handmaidens of philosophy, so also is <lb/>
            philosophy the handmaiden of wisdom; but philosophy teaches <lb/>
            temperance with regard to the belly, and temperance with <lb/>
            regard to the parts below the belly, and also temperance and <lb/>
            restraint of the tongue. Now these qualities are said to be <lb/>
            worthy of praise for their own sakes, but they would appear <lb/>
            more respectable still if they were cultivated for the sake of <lb/>
            doing honour to and giving pleasure to God.</p>
          <p>We must, therefore, always remember the legitimate mis­ <lb/>
            tress when we are about to espouse her handmaidens ; and let <lb/>
            us be said indeed to be the husbands of the latter, but still let <lb/>
            our legitimate mistress be our real wife, and not be merely <lb/>
            called such.</p>
          <p>XV. Again, she gives Hagar to him, not the first moment <lb/>
            that he arrives in the country of the Canaanites, but after he <lb/>
            has abode there ten years. And what the meaning of this <lb/>
            statement is we must investigate in no careless manner.</p><pb n="174"/>
            
          <p>Now, at the beginning of our existence, our soul dwelt <lb/>
            among the passions alone as its foster-brethren, griefs, pains, <lb/>
            fears, desires, and pleasures, which reach it through the <lb/>
            medium of the external senses, before reason was as yet able <lb/>
            to see good and evil, and to distinguish accurately the points <lb/>
            wherein these things differ from one another, but while it was <lb/>
            still wavering and hesitating, and as it were closing its eyes in <lb/>
            profound sleeep ; but as time advances, when advancing out of <lb/>
            the age of infancy we are on the point of becoming young men, <lb/>
            then, without any delay, the double trunk of virtue and wicked­ <lb/>
            ness springs forth out of one root, and we attain to a compre­ <lb/>
            hension of them both, but still we by all means choose one of <lb/>
            the two ; those who are well disposed choosing virtue, and those <lb/>
            of the contrary character choosing wickedness. These things, <lb/>
            now, being previously sketched out in this manner, we must <lb/>
            become aware that Egypt is the symbol of the passions and <lb/>
            the land of the Canaanites, the emblem of the wickednesses ; <lb/>
            so that it is in strict accordance with natural probability that- <lb/>
            God, after having roused his people' and made them depart <lb/>
            from Egypt, leads them into the country of the Canaanites: <lb/>
            for the man, as I have said before, at his very earliest birth <lb/>
            had the Egyptian passions assigned him to dwell among, being <lb/>
            deeply rooted in pleasures and in pains ; and at a subsequent <lb/>
            time he departs as if to found a colony, and migrates towards <lb/>
            wickedness. His reason now being inclined to a more acute <lb/>
            sight, and comprehending accurately both the opposite <lb/>
            extremes of good and of evil, but nevertheless choosing the <lb/>
            worse part, because it has a great, share in mortal nature, to <lb/>
            which what is evil is in some degree akin, as also the contrary, <lb/>
            namely, good, is akin to the divine nature.</p>
          <p>XVI. But these are the different countries of each respect­ <lb/>
            ive nature ; passions, that is to say, Egypt, being the country <lb/>
            of the age of childhood; and wickedness, that is the land of <lb/>
            Canaan, being the country of the age of youth. But the <lb/>
            sacred scripture, although it is well acquainted with the <lb/>
            different countries of the mortal race, suggests to us what <lb/>
            ought to be done and what will be advantageous to us, enjoin­ <lb/>
            ing us to hate the heathen, and their laws, and their customs, <lb/>
            in that passage where he says, " And the Lord spake unto <lb/>
            Moses, saying, Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto <lb/>
            them, I am the Lord your God ; ye shall not behave according <lb/>
             <pb n="175"/>
            to the customs of Egypt in which ye dwelt among them, and <lb/>
            ye shall not walk in their laws. Ye shall do my judgments. <lb/>
            and ye shall not do according to the customs of the land of <lb/>
            Canaan, into which I am leading you to dwell there. And ye <lb/>
            shall keep my commandments, and ye shall walk in them. I <lb/>
            am the Lord your God. And ye shall keep all my command­ <lb/>
            ments and my judgments, and ye shall do them. He that <lb/>
            doeth them the same shall live in them. I am the Lord your <lb/>
            God : and ye shall keep all my commandments and my judg <lb/>
            ments. ”*</p>
          <p>Therefore, real true life, above everything else, consists in <lb/>
            the judgments and commandments of God, so that the customs <lb/>
            and practices of the impious must be death: but there are <lb/>
            some races which take no note of passions and of wickednesses, <lb/>
            from whom the multitudes of impious persons and wickedness <lb/>
            are sprung.</p>
          <p>Therefore, ten years after our departure to settle in the land <lb/>
            of the Canaanites let us marry Hagar, since from the first <lb/>
            moment that we become rational beings, we seek for ignorance <lb/>
            and a deficiency of knowledge which is pernicious in its own <lb/>
            nature ; but at a subsequent period, and at a perfect number, <lb/>
            namely, the legal number of the decade, we come to feel a <lb/>
            desire for that instruction which is able to benefit us.</p>
          <p>XVII. But the sons of the musicians have accurately and <lb/>
            carefully investigated the question respecting the decade ; and <lb/>
            the most sacred Moses has composed a hymn, with no slight <lb/>
            degree of skill, attributing the most excellent things to this <lb/>
            number of the decade, such as prayers, first-fruits, the <lb/>
            continual and unceasing offerings of the priests, the observance <lb/>
            of the passover, the atonement,! the remission of debts, and <lb/>
            the return to the ancient allotments of property at the end of <lb/>
            every fifty years; ‡ the preparation and furnishing of the <lb/>
            indissoluble tabernacle,§ and ten thousand other things which <lb/>
            it would take a long time to enumerate. However, we must <lb/>
            not pass over the most important points.</p>
          <p>In the first place he represents Noah to us (and this man <lb/>
            is the first who is specially entitled just, in the holy scriptures), <lb/>
            as the tenth in succession from him who was formed out of the <lb/>
            earth, not intending by this statement to indicate the number <note type="footnote"> * Leviticus xviii. 1. </note><note type="footnote"> ‡ Leviticus xxv. 9. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Leviticus xxiii. 27. </note><note type="footnote"> § Exodus xxvi. 1. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="176"/>
            of years that had elapsed, but rather to show clearly that as <lb/>
            the decade is the most perfect boundary and end of the num­ <lb/>
            bers which proceed onwards from the unit, so also just in the <lb/>
            soul is the perfection and true end of the actions of human <lb/>
            life. For the number three when multiplied by itself so as to <lb/>
            make nine, the oracles have pronounced to be the most warlike <lb/>
            of numbers ; but when one is added to it so as to complete the <lb/>
            number ten, then they receive it as a friendly one. And as a <lb/>
            proof of this, they allege the kingdoms of the nine kings,* <lb/>
            (when the civil war was fanned into a flame, the four passions <lb/>
            rising up against the five outward senses, and when the entire <lb/>
            soul, like a city, was in danger of being subjected to an utter <lb/>
            overthrow and destruction,) which the wise Abraham, appear­ <lb/>
            ing as the tenth king, put an end to, by joining in the warfare. <lb/>
            He then caused a calm instead of a storm, and health instead <lb/>
            of disease, and life, if one may speak the plain truth, instead <lb/>
            of death, showing himself as the trophy-bearer of God who <lb/>
            giveth the victory, to whom also he consecrated the tenths as <lb/>
            a grateful offering on account of his victory.</p>
          <p>Moreover, he also separates off the tenth of all the cattle <lb/>
            which come “under the rod,”† I mean by this under instruction, <lb/>
            and of all those which are of a tame and tractable sort, pro­ <lb/>
            nouncing them to be holy by an express provision of the law. <lb/>
            In order that so, by many concurrent testimonies, we may learn <lb/>
            the particular and especial appropriateness of the number ten <lb/>
            to God, and of the number nine to our mortal race.</p>
          <p>XVIII. But also it is expressly ordered, that men should <lb/>
            offer as first fruits the tenths, not only of animals, but also of <lb/>
            all the things which grow up out of the earth ; “ For," says <lb/>
            the scripture, " every tenth of the earth from the seed and <lb/>
            from the fruit of every tree, is holy to the Lord: and every <lb/>
            tenth of oxen and sheep, and everything of any cattle which <lb/>
            passes under the rod, of all these the tenth shall be holy to the <lb/>
            Lord." You see that he thinks that it is proper to make an <lb/>
            offering, by way of first fruits from the corporeal mass that is <lb/>
            around us, which is really earthly and wooden ; for life, and <lb/>
            durability, and increase, and good health, fall to his share <lb/>
            through the divine grace. You see also, that again an express <lb/>
            command is 'given to offer first-fruits from all the irrational <lb/>
            animals that are around ourselves; and by these are meant <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xiv. 1. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Leviticus xxvii. 32. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="177"/>
            the outward senses. For to see, and to hear, and to smell, and <lb/>
            to taste, and also to touch are divine gifts, for which it is our <lb/>
            duty to give thanks.</p>
          <p>But not only are we taught to thank the giver of all good <lb/>
            ness for these earthly, and wooden, and corporeal things, and <lb/>
            for the irrational animals, the outward senses, but also for the <lb/>
            mind, which, to speak with strict propriety, is man in man, the <lb/>
            better in the worse, the immortal in the mortal. On this <lb/>
            account I think it is, that God ordered to be consecrated the <lb/>
            whole of the first-born, the tenth, I mean the tribe of Levi, <lb/>
            taking them in exchange for the first-born, for the preservation <lb/>
            and protection of holiness, and piety, and sacred ministrations, <lb/>
            which all have reference to the honour of God. For the first <lb/>
            and best thing in ourselves is our reason, and it is very proper <lb/>
            to offer up the first-fruits of our cleverness, and acuteness, and <lb/>
            comprehension, and prudence, and of all our other faculties <lb/>
            which we have in connection with our reason as first-fruits to <lb/>
            God, who has bestowed upon us this great abundance of power <lb/>
            of exerting our intelligence. From this consideration it was, <lb/>
            that Jacob, the practiser of virtue, at the beginning of. his <lb/>
            prayers, says : “ Of all that thou givest me, I will set apart <lb/>
            and consecrate a tenth to thee."* And the sacred scripture, <lb/>
            which was written after the prayers on occasion of victory, <lb/>
            which Melchisedek, who had received a self-instructed and self- <lb/>
            taught priesthood, makes, says : “ For he gave him a tenth of <lb/>
            all the things,”† assigning to him the outward senses the <lb/>
            faculty of feeling properly, and by the sense of speech the <lb/>
            faculty of speaking well, and by the senses connected with the <lb/>
            mind the faculty of thinking well.</p>
          <p>Very beautifully, therefore, and at the same time most <lb/>
            unavoidably, does the sacred historian tell us in the fashion of <lb/>
            an incidental narrative, when the memorial of that heavenly and <lb/>
            divine food was consecrated in the golden urn, that " gomor <lb/>
            was the tenth part of three measures.”‡For in us men there <lb/>
            appear to be three measures, the outward senses, and speech, <lb/>
            and mind. The outward sense being the measure of the <lb/>
            objects of outward sense, speech being the measure of nouns <lb/>
            and verbs, and of whatever is said; and the mind being the <lb/>
            measure of those things which can only be perceived by the <lb/>
            intellect. We must therefore offer first-fruits of each of these <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xxviii. 22. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Genesis xiv. 20. </note> <note type="footnote"> ‡ Exodus xvi. 36. </note> <note type="footnote"> VOL. II. </note> <note type="footnote"> N </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="178"/>
            three measures as a sacred tenth, in order that our powers of <lb/>
            speaking, and of feeling, and of comprehending, may be seen to <lb/>
            be irreproachable and sound, in reference to and in connection <lb/>
            with God. For this is the true and just measure, and the <lb/>
            things that relate to ourselves are false and unjust measures.</p>
          <p>XIX. Very appropriately, therefore, in the case of sacrifices <lb/>
            also, the tenth part of the measure of fine wheat flour will be <lb/>
            brought upon the altar, together with the victims. But the <lb/>
            number of nine, which is what is left of the number ten, will <lb/>
            remain among us. And the daily sacrifice of the priests <lb/>
            corresponds also to these facts. For it is expressly commanded <lb/>
            to them to offer every day the tenth part of an ephah *of fine <lb/>
            wheat flour. For, passing over the ninth number, the god who <lb/>
            was only discernible by the outward senses and by opinion, <lb/>
            they learnt to worship the tenth, who is the only living and true <lb/>
            God. For the world had nine portions assigned to it, eight in <lb/>
            heaven, namely the portion of the fixed stars and the seven <lb/>
            planets which are all borne forward in the same arrangement, <lb/>
            and the ninth being the earth in conjunction with the air and <lb/>
            water. For of these things there is only one bond and <lb/>
            connection, though they admit all kinds of various changes and <lb/>
            alterations. Therefore men in general have paid honours to <lb/>
            these nine portions, and to the world which is compounded of <lb/>
            them. But the perfect man honours only that being who is <lb/>
            above the nine, and who is their creator, being the tenth <lb/>
            portion, namely God. For having examined into the whole of <lb/>
            his works, he has felt a love for the creator of them, and he <lb/>
            has become anxious to be his suppliant and servant. On this <lb/>
            account the priest offers up a tenth every day to the tenth, the <lb/>
            only and everlasting God. This is, to speak properly, the <lb/>
            spiritual passover of the soul, the passing over of all the <lb/>
            passions and of every object of the outward senses to the tenth, <lb/>
            which is the proper object of the intellect, and which is divine.</p>
          <p>For it is said in the scripture: " On the tenth day of this <lb/>
            month let each of them take a sheep according to his house ; ”† <lb/>
            in order that from the tenth, there may be consecrated to the <lb/>
            tenth, that is to God, the sacrifices which have been preserved <lb/>
            in the soul, which is illuminated in two portions out of the <lb/>
            three, until it is entirely changed in every part, and becomes a <lb/>
            heavenly brilliancy like a full moon, at the height of its <note type="footnote"> * Exodus x. 20. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Exodus xii. 3. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="179"/>
            increase at the end of the second week, and so is able not only <lb/>
            to guard, but even to sacrifice uninjured and faultless improve­ <lb/>
            ments, that is to say, propitiations. For this propitiation also <lb/>
            is established in the tenth day of the month, when the soul <lb/>
            addresses its supplications to the tenth portion, namely to God, <lb/>
            and has learnt, by its own sagacity and acuteness, the insigni­ <lb/>
            ficance and nothingness of the creature, and also the excessive <lb/>
            perfection and pre-eminent excellence in all good things of the <lb/>
            uncreated God.</p>
          <p>Therefore God becomes at once propitious, and propitious <lb/>
            too, even without any supplications being addressed to him, to <lb/>
            those who abase and humble themselves, and who are not <lb/>
            puffed up with vain arrogance and self-opinion. This is <lb/>
            remission and deliverance, this is complete freedom of the soul, <lb/>
            shaking off the wanderings in which it wandered, and fleeing <lb/>
            for a secure anchorage to the one nature which cannot wander, <lb/>
            and which rises up to return to the lot which it formerly <lb/>
            received when it had brilliant aspirations, and when it <lb/>
            vigorously toiled in labours which had virtuous ends for their <lb/>
            object. For then admiring it for its exertions, the holy <lb/>
            scripture honoured it, giving it a most especial honour, an <lb/>
            immortal inheritance, a place namely in the imperishable race. <lb/>
            This is what the wise Abraham supplicates for, when that <lb/>
            which in word indeed is the land of Sodom, but in real fact is <lb/>
            the soul made barren of all good things and blinded as to its <lb/>
            reason, is about to be burnt up, in order that if the memorial <lb/>
            of justice, namely the tenth* part be found in it, it may obtain <lb/>
            a sort of amnesty. Therefore he begins his supplication with <lb/>
            a prayer for pardon, connected with the number fifty, and <lb/>
            terminates with the number ten, the lowest number for whose <lb/>
            deliverance he can dare to entreat.</p>
          <p>XX. From which consideration it appears to me to have <lb/>
            been, that Moses, after the appointment of chiliarchs, or com­ <lb/>
            manders of thousands, and of centurians, and of captains of <lb/>
            fifties,! thought proper to appoint captains of ten over all, in <lb/>
            order that if the mind was not able to be improved by means <lb/>
            of the elder orders, it might at least be purified by these last <lb/>
            in order. And the son of the man who was devoted to learning, <lb/>
            learnt a very beautiful doctrine when he went on that admirable <lb/>
            embassy, asking in marriage for the self-taught wise man that <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xviii. 32. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Exodus xviii. 25. </note> <note type="footnote"> N 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="180"/>
            most appropriate sister, namely, perseverance. For he takes <lb/>
            ten camels,* a reminding of the number ten, that is to say, of <lb/>
            right instruction, from among many and, indeed, infinite <lb/>
            memorials of the Lord. He also takes of his good things, <lb/>
            evidently not silver, nor any gold, nor any other of those things <lb/>
            which consist of perishable materials; for Moses never gave <lb/>
            the favourable appellation of good to any of these things, but <lb/>
            those genuine good things which are the only good things of <lb/>
            the soul; and those he appropriates for the use of his journey, <lb/>
            and for his purposes of traffic, namely, instruction, improve­ <lb/>
            ment, study, desire, admiration, enthusiasm, prophecy, and the <lb/>
            love of doing good actions; to which objects, a man who <lb/>
            devotes all his care, and who practises the actions calculated <lb/>
            to ensure their attainment, when he is about, as it were, to <lb/>
            anchor in a safe harbour after having been tossed in a stormy <lb/>
            sea, will take two earrings, each of a drachm in weight, <lb/>
            and two golden armlets of ten shekels weight of gold for the <lb/>
            arms of her who is sought in marriage.t Oh the divine <lb/>
            ornament! We may understand that the drachm means the <lb/>
            faculty of hearing, and the unbroken unit, and the attractive <lb/>
            nature ; for it is not becoming for hearing to have leisure to <lb/>
            attend to anything except to that speech alone which sets <lb/>
            forth in a suitable manner the virtues of the one and only <lb/>
            God. And the ten shekels weight of gold mean attempts at <lb/>
            works; for the actions, in accordance with wisdom, are esta­ <lb/>
            blished in perfect numbers, and every one of them is more <lb/>
            precious than gold.</p>
          <p>XXI. Something of this kind, now, is the contribution <lb/>
            made by the princes, selected and appointed with reference <lb/>
            to worth and merit, which they made when the soul being <lb/>
            properly prepared and adorned by philosophy, was celebrating <lb/>
            the festival of the dedication in a sacred and becoming <lb/>
            manner, giving thanks to God its teacher and its guide; <lb/>
            for it “ offers up a censer full of frankincense, ten golden <lb/>
            shekels in weight," ‡ in order that the wise man alone may <lb/>
            judge of the odours which are exhaled by prudence and by <lb/>
            every virtue. But when they appear to be made propitious, <lb/>
            then Moses will sing a sacred hymn over them, saying, " The <lb/>
            Lord has smelt the smell of a sweet savour," using the word <lb/>
            to smell here as equivalent to approving of; for God is not <note type="footnote"> e Genesis xxiv. 10. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Genesis xxiv. 22. </note> <note type="footnote"> ‡ Numbers vii. 14. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="181"/>
            formed like a man, nor has lie any need of nostrils, or of any <lb/>
            other organic parts. But as he proceeds onwards he speaks <lb/>
            alsoo f the divine abode, the tabernacle, and its ten curtains <lb/>
            for, in fact, the compound edifice of entire wisdom has been <lb/>
            assigned the perfect number, the number ten.</p>
          <p>And wisdom is the court and palace of the all governing and <lb/>
            only absolute and independent king. Accordingly, this is his <lb/>
            abode, discernible only by the intellect; but the world is per­ <lb/>
            ceptible by the outward senses; since Moses made the curtains <lb/>
            of such things as are symbols of the four elements, for they <lb/>
            were made of fine flax, and of hyacinthine colour, and of purple, <lb/>
            and of scarlet,-four numbers, as I have said before. Now the <lb/>
            fine flax is an emblem of the earth, for the flax grows out of <lb/>
            the earth; and the hyacinthine colour is a symbol of the air, <lb/>
            for it is black by nature ; purple (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ποςϕύςα</foreign>), again, is a symbol <lb/>
            of the water; for the cause of this dye is derived from the sea, <lb/>
            being the shell-fish of the same name (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἡ ποςϕύςα</foreign>); and scarlet <lb/>
            is a symbol of fire, for it most nearly resembles a flame.</p>
          <p>Again, that omnipotent overseer and ruler of the universe <lb/>
            reproved the state of Egypt, when rebellious against the rein, <lb/>
            when it was extolling with grandiloquent words the mind as an <lb/>
            adversary of God, and bestowing on it all the ensigns of kingly <lb/>
            authority, such as the throne, the sceptre, the diadem; and <lb/>
            chastised it with ten stripes and severe punishment. And in <lb/>
            the same manner, also, he promises the wise Abraham that he <lb/>
            will work for him the overthrow and complete destruction of <lb/>
            ten nations t exactly, neither more nor less, and that he will <lb/>
            give the country of those who are thus destroyed to his <lb/>
            descendants ; in every instance choosing to employ the number <lb/>
            ten, both for praise and for blame, and also for honour and for <lb/>
            punishment. And yet why do we mention these things ? For <lb/>
            what is more important than this is the fact, that Moses gave <lb/>
            laws to that sacred and divine assembly in a code of ten com­ <lb/>
            mandments in all. And these are the commandments which <lb/>
            are the generic heads, and roots, and principles of the infinite <lb/>
            multitude of particular laws; being the everlasting source of <lb/>
            all commands, and containing every imaginable injunction and <lb/>
            prohibition to the great advantage of those who use them.</p>
          <p>XXII. Very naturally, therefore, is the connection of <lb/>
            Abraham with Hagar, placed at the end of ten years after his <note type="footnote"> * Exodus xxvi. 1. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Deuteronomy vii. 1. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="182"/>
            arrival in the land of the Chaldæans. For it does not follow <lb/>
            that the first moment that we become endowed with reason, <lb/>
            while our intellect is still in a somewhat fluid state, we are <lb/>
            able at once to derive encyclical instruction. But when we <lb/>
            have attained to intelligence and acuteness of comprehension, <lb/>
            then we no longer have a light and superficial mind, but rather <lb/>
            a firm and solid intellect which we can exercise on every sub­ <lb/>
            ject. And it is for this reason that the expression which <lb/>
            follows is added, in connection with the former statement, <lb/>
            " And he went in unto Hagar." For it was becoming for the <lb/>
            scholar to go to his teacher, who was a man of learning, in <lb/>
            order to learn such branches of instruction as are suited to the <lb/>
            nature of man. For now, also, the pupil is represented as <lb/>
            going to the place where he may obtain learning ; but learning <lb/>
            very often anticipates him and runs forward to meet him, <lb/>
            having driven out envy from her habitation, and she attracts <lb/>
            those towards her who are well inclined to her. Accordingly, <lb/>
            one may read that virtue, that is Leah, went forward to meet <lb/>
            the practiser of virtue, and said unto him, " To-day you shall <lb/>
            come in to me,"* when he was returning from the fields. For <lb/>
            where was the man who had the care of the seeds and plants <lb/>
            of knowledge found to come, except to that virtue which he <lb/>
            himself had cultivated ?</p>
          <p>XXIII. But there are times when virtue, as if making <lb/>
            experiment of those who come to her as pupils, to see how <lb/>
            much eagerness and earnestness they have, does not come <lb/>
            forward to meet them, but veiling her face like Tamar, sits <lb/>
            down in the public road, giving room to those who are travel­ <lb/>
            ling along the road to look upon her as a harlot, in order that <lb/>
            those who are over curious on the subject may take off her veil <lb/>
            and disclose her features, and may behold the untouched, and <lb/>
            unpolluted, and most exquisite, and truly virgin beauty of <lb/>
            modesty and chastity. Who then is he who is fond of in­ <lb/>
            vestigating, and desirous of learning, and who thinks it not right <lb/>
            to leave any of those things which are disguised or concealed <lb/>
            unconsidered and unexamined? Who is he, I say, but the <lb/>
            chief captain and king, he who abides by and rejoices in <lb/>
            the agreements which he has made with God, by name Judah? <lb/>
            For says the scripture, " He turned aside out of his road to <lb/>
            Ler, and said unto her, Suffer me to come in unto thee." <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xxx. 16. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Genesis xxxviii. 16. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="183"/>
            (but he was not inclined to offer her any violence), and to see <lb/>
            what is that power which is thus veiled, and for what purpose <lb/>
            it is thus adorned; and after they had come together it is <lb/>
            written, “ And she conceived ; " but the name of the person is <lb/>
            not expressly mentioned. For art conceives and carries along <lb/>
            with it him who is learning it, persuading him to feel <lb/>
            amorously inclined towards her; and also he who is learning <lb/>
            carries with him her who is teaching him, whenever he is fond <lb/>
            of learning.</p>
          <p>And it often happens that be who professes some one of the <lb/>
            indifferent branches of knowledge, when he meets with a pupil <lb/>
            of good natural qualifications, boasts of his success in teaching, <lb/>
            thinking that he, by himself and alone, is the cause of his <lb/>
            pupil's facility in learning. And then, becoming elated and <lb/>
            puffing himself, up he holds his head high, and draws up his <lb/>
            eyebrows and becomes full of pride, and asks very high terms <lb/>
            from those who desire to become his pupils; but those whom <lb/>
            he perceives to be poor but still to be eager for instruction, he <lb/>
            rejects and repels, as if he were the only person who had <lb/>
            found a treasure of wisdom. This is the meaning of the ex­ <lb/>
            pression, " to conceive," namely, to be full of pride, and to be <lb/>
            puffed up with arrogance beyond all moderation, on which <lb/>
            account some persons have appeared to dishonour the queen of <lb/>
            all the intermediate and indifferent branches of knowledge, <lb/>
            virtue, who deserves to be honoured, even for her own sake.</p>
          <p>All the souls, therefore, which, in connection with prudence, <lb/>
            are pregnant of real things, do nevertheless bring forth, sepa­ <lb/>
            rating and distinguishing between things previously in con­ <lb/>
            fusion, like Rebekkah; for she having conceived in her womb <lb/>
            ideas of two nations, the knowledge of virtue and the know­ <lb/>
            ledge of wickedness, having a fortunate labour separated and <lb/>
            distinguished between the nature of each; but those which <lb/>
            have conceived without prudence either miscarry or else <lb/>
            bring forth an offspring inclined to evil contention and so­ <lb/>
            phistry, always either aiming darts and arrows at others, or <lb/>
            having darts and arrows aimed at themselves. And may we <lb/>
            not say that this is natural ? for some fancy that they are just <lb/>
            conceiving, and others that they are actually pregnant, which <lb/>
            is a very different thing; for those who think that they are <lb/>
            already pregnant attribute their pregnancy and the birth of <lb/>
            their offspring to themselves, and pride themselves upon it; <lb/>
             <pb n="184"/>
            but those who look upon themselves as now conceiving, admit <lb/>
            that they have of themselves nothing which they can call <lb/>
            peculiarly their own, but they receive the seed and the pros­ <lb/>
            pects of posterity which are showered upon them from without, <lb/>
            and they admire him who bestows it, and repel the greatest of <lb/>
            evils, namely self-love, by that perfect good, piety towards <lb/>
            the gods.</p>
          <p>XXIV. In this manner also the seeds of the legislative wis­ <lb/>
            dom, which exists among men, were sown, " For there was," <lb/>
            says the same historian, " a man of the tribe of Levi, named <lb/>
            Amram, who took to wife one of the daughters of Levi, and <lb/>
            had her, and she conceived and brought forth a male child; <lb/>
            and seeing that he was a goodly child they concealed him for <lb/>
            three months.”* This is Moses, the purest mind, the child <lb/>
            that is really goodly ; the child that received at the same time <lb/>
            all legislative and prophetic skill by the means of inspired <lb/>
            and heaven-bestowed wisdom ; who, being by birth a member <lb/>
            of the tribe of Levi, and being flourishing both in the things <lb/>
            relating to his mother and in those affecting his father, clings <lb/>
            to the truth; and the greatest profession ever made by the <lb/>
            author and chief of this tribe is this, for he makes bold to say, <lb/>
            that " the only God is alone to be honoured by me;" and <lb/>
            nothing besides of all the things that are inferior to Him, <lb/>
            neither earth, nor sea, nor rivers, nor the nature of the air, <lb/>
            nor the nature of the winds, nor the changes of the atmo­ <lb/>
            sphere, nor the appearances of any animals or plants, nor <lb/>
            the sun, nor the moon, nor the multitude of the stars <lb/>
            moving about in well-arranged revolutions, nor the whole <lb/>
            heaven, nor the entire world.</p>
          <p>This is a boast of a great and magnanimous soul, to rise <lb/>
            above all creation, and to overleap its boundaries, and to cling <lb/>
            to the great uncreated God alone, according to his sacred com­ <lb/>
            mands, in which we are expressly enjoined " to cleave unto <lb/>
            him."t Therefore he, in requital, bestows himself as their in­ <lb/>
            heritance upon those who do cleave unto him, and who serve <lb/>
            him without intermission; and the sacred scripture bears its <lb/>
            testimony in behalf of this assertion, where it says, " The Lord <lb/>
            himself is his inheritance.”‡</p>
          <p>Thus the souls which are already pregnant are naturally <lb/>
            likely to bring forth children, rather than those which are now <note type="footnote"> * Exodus ii. 1. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Deut. xxx. 20. </note> <note type="footnote"> ‡ Deut. x. 9. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="185"/>
            receiving the seed. But as the eyes of the body do oftentimes <lb/>
            see obscurely, and often on the other hand see clearly, so in <lb/>
            the same manner does the eye of the soul, at times, receive <lb/>
            the particular impressions conveyed to it by things in a most <lb/>
            confused and indistinct manner, and at other times it beholds <lb/>
            them with the greatest purity and clearness; therefore an in­ <lb/>
            distinct and not clearly manifested conception resembles an <lb/>
            embryo which has not yet received any distinct character or <lb/>
            similitude within the womb : but that which is clear and dis­ <lb/>
            tinctly visible, is like one which is completely formed, and <lb/>
            which is already fashioned in an artistic manner as to both its <lb/>
            inward and its outward parts, and which has already received <lb/>
            its suitable character. And with respect to these matters the <lb/>
            following law has been enacted with great beauty and pro­ <lb/>
            priety: " If while two men are fighting one should strike a <lb/>
            woman who is great with child, and her child should come <lb/>
            from her before it is completely formed, he shall be mulcted <lb/>
            in a fine, according to what the husband of the woman shall <lb/>
            impose upon him, and he shall pay the fine deservedly. But <lb/>
            if the child be fully formed, he shall pay life for life."*</p>
          <p>For it was not the same thing, to destroy a perfect and an <lb/>
            imperfect work of the mind, nor is what is only likened by a <lb/>
            figure similar to what is really comprehended, nor is what is <lb/>
            only hoped for similar to what really exists. On this account, <lb/>
            in one case, an uncertain penalty is affixed to an uncertain <lb/>
            action; in another, a definite punishment is enacted by law <lb/>
            against an act which is perfected, but which is perfected not <lb/>
            with respect to virtue, but with reference to what is done in an <lb/>
            irreproachable manner, according to some act. For it is not <lb/>
            she who has just received the seed, but she who has been for <lb/>
            some time pregnant, who brings forth this offspring, professing <lb/>
            boasting rather than modesty. For it is impossible that she <lb/>
            who .has been pregnant some time should miscarry, since it is <lb/>
            fitting that the plant should be conducted to perfection by him <lb/>
            who sowed it; but it is not strange if some mishap should <lb/>
            befall the woman who was pregnant, since she was afflicted <lb/>
            with a disease beyond the art of the physician.</p>
          <p>XXV. And do not suppose that Hagar is represented as <lb/>
            beholding herself as pregnant, by the words, " seeing that she <lb/>
            had conceived," but as beholding her mistress Sarah ; for after­ <note type="footnote"> * Exodus xxi. 22. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="186"/>
            wards she speaks of herself, and says, " Seeing that she was <lb/>
            pregnant, she was despised before her.''* Why so? Because the <lb/>
            intermediate and indifferent arts, and the sciences in accord <lb/>
            ance with them, see indeed of what they are pregnant, but <lb/>
            they nevertheless see in every respect but dimly; but the <lb/>
            sciences comprehend clearly and very distinctly. For science <lb/>
            is something beyond art, having derived from reason a certain <lb/>
            firmness and exemption from error; for this is the definition ot <lb/>
            art, a system of comprehensions well practised with reference <lb/>
            to some desirable end, the word desirable being very properly <lb/>
            added by reason of the abundance of evil arts. But the <lb/>
            definition of science is a safe and firm comprehension, which, <lb/>
            through reason, is not liable to any error. Therefore we call <lb/>
            music and grammar, and other pursuits, arts; for those also <lb/>
            who are made perfect in them, as musicians, or grammarians. <lb/>
            are called artists. But we call philosophy and the other virtues, <lb/>
            sciences, and those who are possessed of the knowledge of <lb/>
            them we call scientific; for they are prudent, and temperate, <lb/>
            and philosophical, not one of whom is ever deceived in the <lb/>
            doctrines of a philosophy which he himself has cultivated, any <lb/>
            more than the artists, whom I have mentioned before, err in <lb/>
            their speculations with respect to their indifferent arts.</p>
          <p>For as the eyes see, and still the mind sees more clearly <lb/>
            by means of the eyes; and as the ears hear, but nevertheless <lb/>
            the mind hears better through the medium of the ears ; and as <lb/>
            the nostrils smell, and yet the soul smells more precisely <lb/>
            through the instrumentality of the nostrils ; and in like manner, <lb/>
            as the other external senses comprehend their respective <lb/>
            appropriate objects, still the mind comprehends them also <lb/>
            more purely and distinctly by their ministration. For to speak <lb/>
            properly, it is the mind which is the eye of eyes, the hearing <lb/>
            of hearing, and the more pure external sense of each of the <lb/>
            external senses, using them as ministers in a court of justice, <lb/>
            and itself deciding on the nature of the objects submitted to it, <lb/>
            so as to approve of some and to reject others. In the same <lb/>
            way, those that are called the intermediate arts, resembling the <lb/>
            faculties of the body, indulge in contemplations according to <lb/>
            certain simple observations of them, but the sciences do so with <lb/>
            greater accuracy and with an exceedingly careful investigation.</p>
          <p>For the same relation that the mind bears to the outward <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xvi. 4. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="187"/>
            sense, that same does science bear towards art; for, as has been <lb/>
            said before, the soul is as it were the outward sense of the <lb/>
            outward sense; therefore each of them has attracted to itself <lb/>
            some slight things of nature, concerning which it labours and <lb/>
            occupies itself, geometry having appropriated lines, and music <lb/>
            sounds, and philosophy the whole nature of existing things. <lb/>
            For this world is its subject matter, and so is the whole <lb/>
            essence, both visible and invisible, of existing things.</p>
          <p>What then is there wonderful if the soul, which sees both <lb/>
            the whole and the parts, sees them too better than they do, as <lb/>
            if it were furnished with larger and more acute eyes ? Very <lb/>
            naturally, therefore, proper philosophy will behold intermediate <lb/>
            instruction its handmaiden, and see that she is pregnant, more <lb/>
            than the other will see that she is.</p>
          <p>XXVI. And yet even this is not unknown to any one, namely, <lb/>
            that philosophy has bestowed upon all the particular sciences <lb/>
            their first principles and seeds, from which speculations <lb/>
            respecting them appear to arise. For it is geometry which <lb/>
            invented equilateral and scalene triangles, and circles, and <lb/>
            polygons, and all kinds of other figures. But it was no <lb/>
            longer geometry that discovered the nature of a point, and a <lb/>
            line, and a superficies, and a solid, which are the roots and <lb/>
            foundations of the aforementioned figures. For from whence <lb/>
            could it define and pronounce that a point is that which has <lb/>
            no parts, that a line is length without breadth ; that a super­ <lb/>
            ficies is that which has only length and breadth ; that a solid <lb/>
            is that which has the three properties, length, breadth, and <lb/>
            depth? For these discoveries belong to philosophy, and the <lb/>
            consideration of these definitions belongs wholly to the phi­ <lb/>
            losopher. Again, to write and read is the undertaking of this <lb/>
            more imperfect kind of grammar, which some people, pervert­ <lb/>
            ing the name of, call grammatistica. But to the more perfect <lb/>
            kind of grammar belongs the explanation of the great works <lb/>
            of the poets and historians.</p>
          <p>When, therefore, men are going through the different parts <lb/>
            of speech, are they not in so doing trying to drag over to <lb/>
            themselves and appropriate as a kind of accessory the dis­ <lb/>
            coveries of philosophy? For it is the peculiar province of <lb/>
            philosophy to inquire what a conjunction, what a noun, what a <lb/>
            verb, what a common noun, what a particular noun, what is <lb/>
            deficient in a speech, what is superfluous, what is an affirma­ <lb/>
             <pb n="188"/>
            tive, what an interrogative, what an indirect question, what is <lb/>
            a comprehensive expression, what is a supplicatory form of <lb/>
            address. For this is a science which has been compounded <lb/>
            for the purpose of the investigation of independent propo­ <lb/>
            sitions, and axioms, and categorems. But, moreover, has not <lb/>
            the whole question of semi-vowels, or vowels, or such elements <lb/>
            as are completely mute, and the consideration of the sense in <lb/>
            which each of these expressions is ordinarily used, and in <lb/>
            short every notion connected with the voice, and the elements, <lb/>
            and the parts of speech, been thoroughly worked out and <lb/>
            brought to an accurate system by philosophy ? And those <lb/>
            thieves, after having as it were carried off a few drops from her <lb/>
            torrent, and having sought to impregnate their own shallow <lb/>
            souls with what they have stolen, are not ashamed to bring <lb/>
            forth her resources as their own.</p>
          <p>XXVII. On which account, being elated and proud, they <lb/>
            disregard the mistress to whom in reality the authority-and <lb/>
            the complete confirmation of their contemplations belong. <lb/>
            But she, perceiving their neglect, will convict them, and will <lb/>
            speak freely to them, and say, " I am treated unjustly, and in <lb/>
            utter violation of pur agreement, as far as depends on you who <lb/>
            transgress the covenants entered into between us ; for from the <lb/>
            time that you first took to your bosom the elementary branches <lb/>
            of education, you have honoured above measure the offspring <lb/>
            of my handmaiden, and have respected her as your wife, and <lb/>
            you have so completely repudiated me that you never by any <lb/>
            chance came to the same place with me. And perhaps this <lb/>
            may be only a suspicion of mine respecting you, arising from <lb/>
            your open connection with my servant, which leads me to <lb/>
            conjecture your alienation from myself, though it is not really <lb/>
            manifest. But if your disposition is contrary to that which I <lb/>
            suspect, still it is impossible for any one else to know this, but <lb/>
            it is easy to God alone." On which account she says very <lb/>
            appropriately, “ May God judge between thee and me ;* not <lb/>
            making haste to condemn him beforehand as having done her <lb/>
            wrong, but intimating a doubt, that perhaps he may speedily <lb/>
            do her right, which in point of fact is seen to be the case not <lb/>
            long afterwards, when he, excusing himself and remedying her <lb/>
            doubts, says to her, " Behold thy handmaiden is in thy hands, <lb/>
            do unto her as it seemeth good to thee." <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xvi. 5. </note> <pb n="189"/>
            </p>
          <p>For also, when he calls her her handmaiden, he confesses <lb/>
            both facts, both that she is a slave and also that she is a <lb/>
            child ; for the name of the handmaiden (<foreign xml:lang="grc">παιδίσϰη</foreign>) suits both <lb/>
            these circumstances. At the same time also, he confesses the <lb/>
            contrary things, opposing the child to the full-grown woman, <lb/>
            and the mistress to her slave, all but crying out in plain <lb/>
            words : I embrace indeed encyclical instruction as a younger <lb/>
            maiden and as a handmaiden, but I honour knowledge and <lb/>
            prudence as full-grown and a mistress.</p>
          <p>And the expression, " She is in thy bands," means, she is in <lb/>
            thy power and subject to thee. And this is also a symbol of <lb/>
            something else of this nature, namely, that the qualities of <lb/>
            the handmaiden come to the hands of the' body ; for the <lb/>
            encyclical branches of knowledge have need of the bodily <lb/>
            organs and faculties ; but the qualities of the mistress reach <lb/>
            the soul ; for the things which belong to prudence and know­ <lb/>
            ledge come under the province of reason ; so that in proportion <lb/>
            as the mind is more powerful and more efficacious than, and <lb/>
            in short superior to, the hand, in the same proportion also do <lb/>
            I look upon knowledge and wisdom as more admirable than <lb/>
            encyclical accomplishment, and I honour them in a higher <lb/>
            degree.</p>
          <p>Do thou, therefore, 0 thou who both art the mistress, and <lb/>
            who art so accounted by me, take all my encyclical instruction <lb/>
            and use it as thy handmaid, doing to it as it shall seem good <lb/>
            to thee; for I am not unaware that whatever pleases thee is <lb/>
            in all respects good even though it may not always be <lb/>
            pleasant, and is useful even though it be far removed from <lb/>
            being agreeable. But admonition and reproof are both good <lb/>
            and profitable to those who stand in need of correction, which <lb/>
            indeed the holy scriptures call by another name, and de­ <lb/>
            nominate affliction.</p>
          <p>XXVIII.- On which account the historian presently adds, <lb/>
            “ And she afflicted her an expression equivalent to, she <lb/>
            admonished and corrected her. For a sharp spear is very <lb/>
            profitable for those who are corrupted by over security and <lb/>
            indolences, just as it is of use with restive horses ; since they <lb/>
            can scarcely be subdued and made manageable by the whip <lb/>
            and by gentle leading. Do you not see how they are utterly <lb/>
            unaffected by the prizes proposed to them?* They are fat, <note type="footnote"> * This is scarcely sense, but the truth probably is that the passage </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="190"/>
            they are stout, they are sleek, they breathe hard; then they <lb/>
            take up the actions of impiety, miserable and wretched men <lb/>
            that they are, seeking a melancholy reward, being proclaimed <lb/>
            and crowned as conquerors by ungodliness. For by reason of <lb/>
            the prosperity which was constantly flowing gently towards <lb/>
            them, they looked upon themselves as silver or golden gods, <lb/>
            after the fashion of adulterated money, forgetting the real and <lb/>
            true coinage.</p>
          <p>And Moses testifies to this view of the matter when he says, <lb/>
            " He got fat, he became stout, he became swollen, and forsook <lb/>
            God who had created him."* So that if excessive relaxation <lb/>
            begets the greatest of all evils, impiety, its contrary, affliction, <lb/>
            in accordance with the law produces that perfect good, much <lb/>
            praised correction ; and proceeding outward from this point, he <lb/>
            also calls the unleavened bread the symbol of the first festival, <lb/>
            " the bread of affliction.”† And yet who is there who does <lb/>
            not know that feasts and festivals produce cheerful joy and <lb/>
            delectation, and not affliction ? But it is plain that he is here <lb/>
            using in a perverted sense this word for the labour of him <lb/>
            who is the corrector. For the most numerous and greatest <lb/>
            blessings are usually acquired by laborious practice and exer­ <lb/>
            cise, and by vigorously excited labour. But the festival of the <lb/>
            soul is emulation, which is labour to attain those things which <lb/>
            are most excellent and which are brought to perfection; on <lb/>
            which account it is expressly commanded to " eat the unlea­ <lb/>
            vened bread with bitter herbs ;"t not by way of an additional <lb/>
            dish, but because men in general look upon the fact of being <lb/>
            prevented from swelling and boiling over with their appetites, <lb/>
            but being forced to contract and restrain them as a grievous <lb/>
            thing, thinking it a bitter thing to unlearn the indulgence of <lb/>
            their passions, which is the real feast and festival of a mind <lb/>
            which loves honourable contests.</p>
          <p>XXIX. It is for this reason that the law, as it appears to <lb/>
            me, was given in a place which is called Bitterness ; for to do <lb/>
            wrong is pleasant, but to act justly is laborious. And this is <lb/>
            the most unerring law; for the sacred history says, " And after <lb/>
            they had gone out from the passions of Egypt they came to <note type="footnote"> is corrupt. Mangey proposes one or two emendations, but they are <lb/>
            not very satisfactory. </note> <note type="footnote"> * Deuteronomy xxxii. 15. </note><note type="footnote"> ‡ Exodus xii. 8. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Deuteronomy xvi. 3. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="191"/>
            Marah: and they were not able to drink of the water at <lb/>
            Marah, for it was bitter. On this account the name of that <lb/>
            place was called Bitterness. And the people murmured <lb/>
            against Moses, saying, What shall we drink ? And Moses <lb/>
            cried unto the Lord ; and the Lord showed him a stick, and <lb/>
            he cast it into the water, and the water was made sweet. And <lb/>
            then he gave him justification and judgment, and then he <lb/>
            tempted him."* For the invisible trial and proofs of the <lb/>
            soul are in labouring and in enduring bitterness ; for then it is <lb/>
            hard to know which way it will incline ; for many men are <lb/>
            very speedily fatigued and fall away, thinking labour a terrible <lb/>
            adversary, and they let their hands fall out of weakness, like <lb/>
            tired wrestlers, determining to return to Egypt to the indul­ <lb/>
            gence of their passions.</p>
          <p>But others, with much endurance and great vigour, support­ <lb/>
            ing the fearful and terrible events of the wilderness pass <lb/>
            through the contest of life, keeping their life safe from over­ <lb/>
            throw and from destruction, and rising up in vigorous contest <lb/>
            against the necessities of nature, such as hunger, thirst, cold, <lb/>
            and heat, which are in the habit of reducing other persons to <lb/>
            slavery, and subduing them with great exuberance of strength. <lb/>
            And the cause of this is not merely labour, but also the sweet­ <lb/>
            ness with which it is combined ; for the scripture says, " And <lb/>
            the water was made sweet." But sweet and pleasant labour <lb/>
            is called by another name, fondness for labour; for that which <lb/>
            is sweet in labour is the love of, and desire for, and admiration <lb/>
            of, and friendship for, what is honourable. Let no one, there­ <lb/>
            fore, reject such affliction as this, and let no one think that <lb/>
            the table of festivity and cheerfulness is called the bread of <lb/>
            affliction for injury rather than for advantage ; for the soul <lb/>
            which is rightly admonished is supported by the doctrines of <lb/>
            instruction.</p>
          <p>XXX. This unleavened cake is so sacred that it is enjoined <lb/>
            in the holy scriptures, " to place in the innermost part of the <lb/>
            temple, on the golden table, twelve loaves of unleavened bread, <lb/>
            corresponding in number to the twelve tribes ; and those <lb/>
            loaves shall be called the shew-bread.”† And, again, it is in <lb/>
            the law expressly " forbidden to offer any leaven or any honey <lb/>
            upon the altar;”‡ for it is a difficult thing to consecrate as <lb/>
            holy either the sweetnesses of the pleasures according to the <note type="footnote"> * Exodus xv. 23. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Exodus xxv. 30. </note> <note type="footnote"> ‡ Leviticus ii. 11. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="192"/>
            body, or the light and unsubstantial elations of the soul, since <lb/>
            they are by their own intrinsic nature profane and unholy.</p>
          <p>Does not, then, the prophetic word, by Dame Moses, very <lb/>
            rightly speak in dignified language when he says, " Thou shalt <lb/>
            remember all the road by which the Lord God led thee in the <lb/>
            wilderness, and how he afflicted thee, and tried thee, and <lb/>
            proved thee, that he might know what was in thy heart, and <lb/>
            whether thou wouldest keep his commandments. Did he not <lb/>
            afflict thee and oppress thee with hunger, and feed thee with <lb/>
            manna which thy fathers knew not, that he might make thee <lb/>
            know that man shall not live by bread alone, but by every <lb/>
            word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God ?”*</p>
          <p>Who, then, is so impious as to conceive that God is one who <lb/>
            afflicts, and who brings that most pitiable death of hunger <lb/>
            upon those who are not able to live without food? For God is <lb/>
            good, and the cause of good things, bounteous, the saviour, the <lb/>
            supporter, the giver of wealth, the giver of great gifts. <lb/>
            driving out wickedness from the sacred boundaries; for thus <lb/>
            did he drive out the burdens of the earth, Adam and Cain, <lb/>
            from paradise. Let us, then, not be led aside by words, but <lb/>
            let us consider and examine what meaning is intended to be <lb/>
            conveyed under figurative expressions, and pronounce that the <lb/>
            words "he afflicted," are equivalent to "he instructed, and he <lb/>
            admonished, and he corrected." And when it is said that he <lb/>
            oppressed them with hunger, it does not mean that he caused <lb/>
            a deficiency of meat and drink, but of pleasures, and desires, <lb/>
            and fear, and grief, and acts of injustice, and, in short, of all <lb/>
            things which are the works of wickedness or of the passions. <lb/>
            And what is said immediately afterwards is an evidence of tins : <lb/>
            " He fed thee with manna." Is it, then, proper to call that food <lb/>
            which, without any exertion or hardship on his part, and with­ <lb/>
            out any trouble of his is given to man, not out of the earth as <lb/>
            is usual, but from heaven, a marvellous work, afforded for the <lb/>
            benefit of those who are to be permitted to avail themselves of <lb/>
            it, the cause of hunger and affliction, and not rather, on the con­ <lb/>
            trary, the cause of prosperity and happiness, of freedom from <lb/>
            fear, and of a happy state of orderly living? But men in <lb/>
            general and the common herd think that those who are <lb/>
            nourished on the word of God live in a miserable and wretched <lb/>
            manner; for they are without the taste of the all-nourishing <note type="footnote"> * Deuteronomy viii. 2. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="193"/>
            food of wisdom; but they are not aware that they are living <lb/>
            in the height of happiness.</p>
          <p>XXXI. Thus, therefore, there is a certain description of <lb/>
            affliction which is profitable, so that its very most humiliating <lb/>
            form, even slavery, is accounted a great good. And there is a <lb/>
            father who is recorded in the sacred writings as having prayed <lb/>
            for this, for his son, namely, the most excellent Isaac for the <lb/>
            foolish Esau; for he says somewhere, " By thy sword shalt <lb/>
            thou live, and thou shalt serve thy brother."* Judging that <lb/>
            destiny to be the most advantageous one for a man who had <lb/>
            chosen war rather than peace, and who was as it were con­ <lb/>
            stantly armed and engaged in battle, by reason of the sedition <lb/>
            and disorder constantly existing in his soul, the destiny <lb/>
            namely of being a subject and a servant, and of obeying all <lb/>
            the commands which the lover of temperance should lay upon <lb/>
            him.</p>
          <p>And it is from this consideration, as it appears to me that <lb/>
            one of the disciples of Moses, by name the peaceful, who in <lb/>
            his native language is called Solomon, says, " My son, neglect <lb/>
            not the instruction of God, and be not grieved when thou art <lb/>
            reproved by him ; for whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth; <lb/>
            and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth."t Thus, then, <lb/>
            scourging and reproof are looked upon as good, so that by <lb/>
            means of it agreement and relationship with God arise. For <lb/>
            what can be more nearly related than a son is to his father, <lb/>
            and a father to his son ?</p>
          <p>But, that we may not seem to be too prolix connecting one <lb/>
            argument with another, we will, besides what we have already <lb/>
            said, just add one most evident proof that a certain descrip­ <lb/>
            tion of affliction is the work of virtue. For there is such a <lb/>
            law as this, " Thou shalt not afflict any widow or orphan, but <lb/>
            if thou dost afflict them with wickedness." What does <lb/>
            this mean ? Is it then possible to be afflicted -by something <lb/>
            else? For if afflictions were the work of wickedness alone, <lb/>
            then it would be superfluous to add what would be admitted by <lb/>
            all, and which would be understood without any such addition. <lb/>
            But, you will most certainly say, I know that men are <lb/>
            reproved by virtue, and instructed by wisdom; on which <lb/>
            account I do not blame every kind of affliction, but I very <lb/>
            greatly admire that which is the work of justice and of the <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xxvii. 4Q. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Proverbs iii. 11. </note> <note type="footnote"> VOL. II. </note> <note type="footnote"> 0 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="194"/>
            law; for that corrects by means of punishment, but that <lb/>
            which proceeds from folly and wickedness and is pernicious, I <lb/>
            do, as becomes me, detest, and pronounce real evil. When, <lb/>
            therefore, you hear that Hagar was afflicted by Sarah, you must <lb/>
            not suppose that any of those things befell her, which arise <lb/>
            from rivalry and quarrels among women; for the question is <lb/>
            not here about woman, but about minds; the one being <lb/>
            practised in the branches of elementary instruction, and the <lb/>
            other being devoted to the labours of virtue.</p>

          <p>I. “ AND Sarah afflicted her, and she fled from before her <lb/>
            face. And the angel of the Lord found her sitting by a <lb/>
            fountain of water in the wilderness, by a fountain which is in <lb/>
            the way to Shur. And the angel of the Lord said unto her: <lb/>
            ‘Thou handmaiden of Sarah, whence art thou come? and <lb/>
            whither art thou going?' And she answered and said : ' I am <lb/>
            fleeing from the face of Sarah, my mistress.' And the angel <lb/>
            of the Lord said unto her: ' Return unto thy mistress, and be <lb/>
            thou humbled beneath her hands.' And the angel of the Lord <lb/>
            said unto her: ' Behold, thou art with child, and thou shalt <lb/>
            bring forth a son, and shall call his name Ishmael, because the <lb/>
            Lord has heard the cry of thy humiliation. He shall be a rude <lb/>
            man; his hand shall be against every man, and every man's <lb/>
            hand against him.' "*</p>
          <p>Having in our former treatise spoken what was becoming <lb/>
            respecting the preliminary branches of education, and respecting <lb/>
            affliction, we will now proceed in regular order to discuss the <lb/>
            topic of fugitives. Now Moses often mentions persons who <lb/>
            flee, as here he says concerning Hagar, that being afflicted she <lb/>
            fled from the face of her mistress. I think therefore that <lb/>
            there are three causes for flight-hatred, fear, and shame. <lb/>
            Now women leave their husbands out of hatred, and for the <lb/>
            same reason men desert their wives. But children flee from <lb/>
            their parents, and servants from their masters, out of fear. <lb/>
            And lastly, friends avoid their companions out of shame, when <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xvi. 8. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="195"/>
            they have done anything which is displeasing to them And <lb/>
            before now I have known instances of fathers who have led a <lb/>
            life of effeminate luxury, reverencing the austere and philo­ <lb/>
            sophical lives of their sons, and out of shame preferring to live <lb/>
            in the country rather than in the city.</p>
          <p>Now of all these three causes, one may find instances <lb/>
            revealed in the sacred scriptures Accordingly, Jacob, the <lb/>
            practiser of virtue, fled from his father-in-law Laban out of <lb/>
            hatred, and from his brother Esau out of fear, as I shall show <lb/>
            presently. But Hagar flees out of shame. And a proof of <lb/>
            this is, that the angel, that is the word of God, met her, with <lb/>
            the intent to recommend her what she ought to do, and to <lb/>
            guide her in her return to her mistress's house. For he <lb/>
            encouraged her, and said unto her: "The Lord has heard the <lb/>
            cry of thy humiliation," which you uttered, not out of fear, nor <lb/>
            yet out of hatred. For the one is the feeling of an ignoble <lb/>
            soul, and the other of one which loves contention, but under <lb/>
            the influence of that copy of temperance and modesty, shame. <lb/>
            For it was natural, if she had fled out of fear, that he would <lb/>
            have encouraged her mistress, who was holding out threats to <lb/>
            alarm her, to comfort her, and to restore her to tranquillity. <lb/>
            For then it would have been safe for the fugitive to return, and <lb/>
            not before. But no one intercedes for her to her mistress, <lb/>
            inasmuch as she was already appeased by herself. But this <lb/>
            angel, who is reproof, at the same time friendly and full of <lb/>
            advice, out of his good-will teaches her not to feel only shame, <lb/>
            but also to entertain confidence, for that modesty is but half <lb/>
            a virtue, when separated from proper boldness.</p>
          <p>II. Therefore the account which follows will show these <lb/>
            characteristics more accurately. But we must return to the <lb/>
            heads of the question which we have already set forth, and <lb/>
            begin with those who flee under the influence of hatred. <lb/>
            " For," says the scripture, " Jacob concealed his purpose from <lb/>
            Laban the Syrian, so as not to tell him that he was fleeing, and <lb/>
            he fled, he and all that he had."* What then was the cause of <lb/>
            his hatred? For perhaps you are desirous to hear this.</p>
          <p>There are some persons who make to themselves gods of <lb/>
            substance destitute of all distinctive quality, and species, and <lb/>
            shape, neither knowing the cause which puts things in motion, <lb/>
            nor showing any anxiety to learn of those who do know, but <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xvi. 8. </note> <note type="footnote"> o 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="196"/>
            being contented with their ignorance and want of understanding <lb/>
            of the most important kind of learning, which was in fact the <lb/>
            first and only thing of which it was absolutely necessary to <lb/>
            labour for the understanding. Laban now is one of this kind <lb/>
            of persons; for the sacred scriptures attribute to him a flock <lb/>
            devoid of all distinctive marks. And matter, without any <lb/>
            distinctive characteristics, is without any marks in the universe, <lb/>
            and so is in men the soul, which is destitute of learning and <lb/>
            which has no instructors. But there are others who belong to <lb/>
            a better portion, who say that the mind has come and arranged <lb/>
            everything, bringing the disorder which arose from an ochlo­ <lb/>
            cracy among all existing things, into the order established by <lb/>
            the legitimate authority of kingly power. Of this company <lb/>
            Jacob is a follower, who presides over the marked and party- <lb/>
            coloured flock.</p>
          <p>On the other hand the species in the universe is distin­ <lb/>
            guished by marks and is of varied colour, and so also in men is <lb/>
            the mind which has been well instructed and which is fond of <lb/>
            learning. And he who is marked, and who is the companion <lb/>
            of true kingly power, having received a great deal of the social <lb/>
            affection from nature, goes to him who has no distinguishing <lb/>
            marks, and who, as I have said, makes himself gods of the <lb/>
            material powers, and who thinks that besides them there is no <lb/>
            effectual cause of anything, to teach him that his opinions are <lb/>
            not correct. For the world has been created, and has by all <lb/>
            means derived its existence from some extraneous cause. <lb/>
            But the word itself of the Creator is the seal by which each of <lb/>
            existing things is invested with form. In accordance with <lb/>
            which fact perfect species also does from the very beginning <lb/>
            follow things when created, as being an impression and image <lb/>
            of the perfect word. For the animal when first created is <lb/>
            imperfect as to quantity; and a proof of this is the gradual <lb/>
            growth which takes place at each successive age. But it is <lb/>
            perfect as to quality. For the same quality remains in it, as <lb/>
            having been stamped upon it by the divine word which abides <lb/>
            permanently and never charges.</p>
          <p>III. But seeing that he is dumb with respect to learning <lb/>
            and to all desirable and legitimate authority, he very naturally <lb/>
            thinks of flight. For he is afraid that in addition to not being <lb/>
            able to derive any advantage, he may even be injured. For all <lb/>
            connections with the foolish injures us, and very often the soul <lb/>
             <pb n="197"/>
            against its will becomes stamped with the impression of their <lb/>
            insanity of mind. And, in truth, instruction is naturally a <lb/>
            thing inimical to ignorance, and so is industry to indifference. <lb/>
            In reference to which fact the powers devoted to practice and <lb/>
            meditation, when they are set free, cry out, giving a full <lb/>
            account of the causes of their hatred : " Have we not any <lb/>
            longer a share and an inheritance in the house of our father ? <lb/>
            Are we not now accounted aliens by him? For he has sold <lb/>
            us, and he has eaten up and devoured our money. All the <lb/>
            wealth and all the glory which God took from our father shall <lb/>
            belong to us and to our children." * For those who are free <lb/>
            both in name and also in their minds do not consider any <lb/>
            foolish person as either rich or glorious, but look upon all <lb/>
            such persons, so to say, as inglorious and poor, even if they <lb/>
            exceed the fortune of wealthy kings. For they do not say <lb/>
            that they will have the riches of their father, but the riches <lb/>
            which have been taken away ; nor do they say that they shall <lb/>
            possess his glory, but the glory which has been taken away <lb/>
            from him.</p>
          <p>But the wicked man is deprived of all genuine riches and <lb/>
            of all true and honourable glory; for these blessings are <lb/>
            procured by wisdom, and temperance, and the kindred dispo­ <lb/>
            sitions of the soul, and are inherited by those souls which love <lb/>
            virtue. Therefore, it is not the things which belong to the <lb/>
            wicked man, but those of which he is destitute, that are the <lb/>
            abundance and the glory of the good. And he is destitute of <lb/>
            virtues which are their possession, in order that what is said <lb/>
            in another place may be consistent with the passage already <lb/>
            quoted: " Let us sacrifice the abominations of Egypt to the <lb/>
            Lord our God."† For the virtues are perfect and blameless offer­ <lb/>
            ings, and so are the actions in accordance with virtue, which <lb/>
            the Egyptian body, being devoted to the passions, abominates; <lb/>
            for, as in this passage, those things which, according to the <lb/>
            principles of natural philosophy, are reckoned profane among <lb/>
            the Egyptians are called sacred by the Israelites who see <lb/>
            acutely, and are all offered as sacrifices; so, in the same <lb/>
            manner, the man who is the companion of virtue will be the <lb/>
            heir of those things of which every foolish man is deprived and <lb/>
            destitute.</p>
          <p>And these things are true glory, which in fact differs in no <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xxxi. 14. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Exodus viii. 26. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="198"/>
            respect from knowledge, and wealth, not blind wealth, but <lb/>
            that which is the most sharp-sighted of all existing things, <lb/>
            which never receives any base money, not even anything what­ <lb/>
            ever devoid of life unless it be thoroughly tried and approved. <lb/>
            Very naturally, therefore, that person will flee from him who <lb/>
            has no participation in divine blessings, who even in the mat­ <lb/>
            ters in which he accuses another does without perceiving it <lb/>
            accuse himself also, when he says, " If thou hadst told me I <lb/>
            would have sent thee away."* For this very thing was a worthy <lb/>
            cause for your being deserted, if you, being the servant of an <lb/>
            infinite number of masters, pretending to have been invested <lb/>
            with command and authority, proclaimed liberty to others.</p>
          <p>But I, says he, did not take a man as my assistant in the <lb/>
            road which leads to virtue, but I listened to the divine oracles <lb/>
            which enjoined me to depart from hence, and which even now <lb/>
            continues to direct my course. And how would you have sent <lb/>
            me away? surely, as you boast, using pompous language, with <lb/>
            a joy which to me would have been sorrowful, with music <lb/>
            which would have been no music, with dances, and noises des­ <lb/>
            titute of articulate sound and of reason, striking blows on the <lb/>
            soul through the medium of the ears, and with the harp, and <lb/>
            with sounds unsuited to the lyre, and unsuited to harmony, <lb/>
            not being so much organs, as the actions of a whole life. <lb/>
            But these are the things by reason of which I meditated <lb/>
            flight; but you, as it seems, contemplated dragging me back <lb/>
            from my flight, in order that I might return on account of <lb/>
            the deceitful and seductive nature of the external senses, by <lb/>
            which I was scarcely able to permit myself to be carried forward.</p>
          <p>IV. Hatred then, was the cause of the flight which I have <lb/>
            been here describing ; but fear was the cause of the one which <lb/>
            I am about to mention. For, says the sacred historian, <lb/>
            Rebekkah said unto Jacob, " Behold, Esau thy brother threat­ <lb/>
            eneth to kill thee : now therefore, my son, hear my voice, and <lb/>
            rise up, and flee to Laban my brother, to Charran, and dwell <lb/>
            with him certain days, until the anger of thy brother is turned <lb/>
            away, and he forget what thou hast done unto him ; and then <lb/>
            I will send again, and fetch thee back from thence."t For it <lb/>
            was worth while to fear, lest the worse portion of the soul, <lb/>
            lying in an ambuscade, or else moving forwards openly to the <lb/>
            attack, might overthrow and cast down the better part; and so <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xxxi. 27. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Genesis xxvii. 42. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="199"/>
            the counsel of the right-minded perseverance, Rebekkah, was <lb/>
            very good.</p>
          <p>But she says, when you see the bad man coming in with <lb/>
            great impetuosity, against virtue, and making great account of <lb/>
            those things which it is more proper to disregard, such as <lb/>
            wealth, glory, and pleasure, and praising the performance of <lb/>
            actions of injustice, as being the cause of all the advantages <lb/>
            before mentioned : for we see that those who act unjustly, are, <lb/>
            for the most part, men possessed of much silver, and of much <lb/>
            gold, and of high reputation. Do not then, turn away to the <lb/>
            opposite road, and devote yourself to a life of penury, and <lb/>
            abasement, and austerity, and solitude; for, by so doing, you <lb/>
            will irritate your adversary, and arm a more bitter enemy <lb/>
            against yourself. Consider, therefore, now by what conduct <lb/>
            you may avoid his attacks ; apply yourself to the same things, <lb/>
            I do not mean the same pursuits, but to the same things which <lb/>
            are the efficient causes of those things which have been men­ <lb/>
            tioned ; to honours, to offices of authority, to silver, to gold, <lb/>
            to possessions, to money, to colours, to forms, to exceeding <lb/>
            nicety; and when you meet with such things, then, like a <lb/>
            skilful workman, impress the most beautiful appearance on the <lb/>
            material substances: and perfect a most excellent work. <lb/>
            Do you not know, that if a man unacquainted with navigation, <lb/>
            takes the management of a ship, which might otherwise have <lb/>
            reached the harbour in safety, he overturns it? but that a man, <lb/>
            skilful as a pilot, has often saved a ship which otherwise must <lb/>
            have been lost? And also, some sick persons, owing to the <lb/>
            unskilfulness of their medical attendants, have been severely <lb/>
            afflicted with disease; while others, through the skill of their <lb/>
            doctors, have escaped from dangerous sicknesses ? And why <lb/>
            need I have been prolix on this point; for always the things <lb/>
            which are done with skill, are a conviction of those which are <lb/>
            done unskilfully ; and the true praise of the one is an unerring <lb/>
            accusation of the other.</p>
          <p>V. If therefore, you wish to convict a wicked man, who is <lb/>
            also possessed of great wealth, do not disdain an abundance of <lb/>
            money ; for the unhappy man will soon show himself in his <lb/>
            true colours, either as an illiberal and slavish-minded skin-flint, <lb/>
            and parer of people by usury, or else as a profligate and intem­ <lb/>
            perate spendthrift, very ready to devour and to squander, and <lb/>
            a most zealous companion of harlots and brothel-keepers, <lb/>
             <pb n="200"/>
            and pimps, and of every kind of profligate company. But you <lb/>
            will rather bestow your contributions on those who are in want <lb/>
            of friends, and will do favours to, and bestow your liberality on, <lb/>
            your country, and will assist to portion out the daughters of <lb/>
            needy parents, giving them, in addition to their inheritance, <lb/>
            a most sufficient dowry ; and in fact, very nearly throwing all <lb/>
            your own property into the common stock, you will invite to a <lb/>
            participation in it all who are worthy of favour.</p>
          <p>And, in the same manner, when you wish to reprove any <lb/>
            wicked man who is mad with a high opinion of himself and <lb/>
            full of boasting, while you are able yourself to attain to dis­ <lb/>
            tinguished honours, do not disdainfully reject the praise of the <lb/>
            multitude: for by so doing yon will trip up and supplant the <lb/>
            miserable man who takes long strides, and who gives himself <lb/>
            airs. For he will abuse his own renown for the purpose of <lb/>
            behaving with insolence and contumely to others who are <lb/>
            better than he, promoting those who are worse, so as to set <lb/>
            them above them; while you, on the contrary, will give all <lb/>
            worthy persons a share in your renown, giving in this manner <lb/>
            security to those who are good, and by your admonitions <lb/>
            improving those who are not so good. And if you ever go to <lb/>
            a drinking party or to a costly entertainment, go with a good <lb/>
            confidence ; for you will put to shame the intemperate man by <lb/>
            your own dexterity. For he, falling on his belly, and opening <lb/>
            his insatiable desires even before he opens his mouth, will glut <lb/>
            himself in a most shameless and indecorous manner, and will <lb/>
            seize the things belonging to his neighbour, and will lick up <lb/>
            everything without thinking.</p>
          <p>And when he is completely sated with eating, then drinking, <lb/>
            as the poets say, with his mouth open, he will make himself <lb/>
            an object for the laughter and ridicule of all those who behold <lb/>
            him. But do you adopt a moderate course without being com­ <lb/>
            pelled thereto, and if ever you are constrained to indulge your­ <lb/>
            self in things beyond moderation, still make reason the <lb/>
            governor of the necessity, and never go so far as to change <lb/>
            pleasure into unpleasantness, but, if we may speak in such a <lb/>
            manner, be drunk in a sober manner.</p>
          <p>VI. And here therefore truth may not unreasonably blame <lb/>
            those who, without any examination, abandon the business and <lb/>
            means of regulating a civil life, and who say that they have <lb/>
            learnt to despise glory and pleasure; for those men are be­ <lb/>
             <pb n="201"/>
            having insolently, and do not really despise these things, <lb/>
            making an open boast of their sordid, and melancholy, and <lb/>
            stern appearance, and putting forth their austere and dirty <lb/>
            way of living as a bait, as if they were lovers of orderly be­ <lb/>
            haviour, and modesty, and endurance; but they are not able <lb/>
            to deceive those who look into them with greater accuracy, and <lb/>
            who pierce within their disguise, and who are not led astray <lb/>
            by outward show; for having removed these veils and cover­ <lb/>
            ings from the others, they see what is treasured up and con­ <lb/>
            cealed within, and learn what kind of qualities and nature are <lb/>
            theirs: and if they are good they admire them, and if they <lb/>
            are evil they ridicule them, and hate them because of their <lb/>
            hypocrisy.</p>
          <p>Let us then say to such persons, " Are ye zealous admirers <lb/>
            and imitators of a life which hates mixing with and joining <lb/>
            in the society of others, a solitary and uncompanionable life ? <lb/>
            For what specimen of virtue have you ever exhibited while <lb/>
            living in the society of others ? Do ye disdain money ? Have <lb/>
            you, then, who have been professed money-dealers, been <lb/>
            desirous to act justly ? Professing to disregard the pleasures <lb/>
            of the belly and of the parts beneath the belly, have you <lb/>
            behaved with moderation when you have had abundant oppor­ <lb/>
            tunities of indulging these appetites ? Do you despise glory ? <lb/>
            Then, when you have been placed in situations of authority, <lb/>
            have you cultivated an affable humility ? Perhaps you have <lb/>
            ridiculed a participation in the affairs of state, not considering <lb/>
            how useful an employment that is. Have you then first <lb/>
            exercised yourselves in, and directed your attention to, the <lb/>
            public and the private business of life ? and having become <lb/>
            skilful politicians and experienced economists by means of the <lb/>
            kindred virtues of economical and political science, have you, <lb/>
            in your exceeding abundance of these things, prepared for <lb/>
            your migration to another and a better kind of life ? For it is <lb/>
            proper to go through a practical life before beginning the <lb/>
            theoretical one: as being a sort of rehearsal of the more <lb/>
            perfect contest and exhibition.</p>
          <p>In this way it is possible to escape from the charge of hesi­ <lb/>
            tation and indolence. Thus also an express injunction is given <lb/>
            to the Levites to fulfil their works till the time that they are <lb/>
            fifty years of age ; and after they are released from all active <lb/>
            ministrations, to consider and contemplate each particular <lb/>
             <pb n="202"/>
            thing, receiving as a reward for their well-doing in active life, <lb/>
            another life which delights only in knowledge and contem­ <lb/>
            plation. And at other times it is necessary that those who <lb/>
            think themselves worthy to claim the just things of God, <lb/>
            should first of all fulfil their human duties ; for it is great folly <lb/>
            to expect to attain to what is of greater importance, while one <lb/>
            is unable properly to discharge what is of less consequence. <lb/>
            First of all, therefore, be ye known for your virtue among men, <lb/>
            that you may also become established by that which relates to <lb/>
            God." This is the advice which perseverance gives to the man <lb/>
            inclined to the practice of virtue ; but we must now examine <lb/>
            her several expressions with accuracy.</p>
          <p>VII. " Behold," says she, " Esau thy brother threatens <lb/>
            thee." But is it not natural for that disposition, hard as oak <lb/>
            and obstinate through ignorance, by name Esau, who offers the <lb/>
            baits of mortal life to lead you to your destruction ; such baits, <lb/>
            I mean, as wealth, glory, pleasure, and other kindred tempta­ <lb/>
            tions, to seek to kill thee ? But do you, 0 my child! flee from this <lb/>
            contest at present, for you have not as yet had complete strength <lb/>
            for it given to you, but still the nerves of your soul, like those <lb/>
            of a child, are somewhat soft and weak. And it is for this <lb/>
            reason that she calls him " my child," which is a name of <lb/>
            affection, and also one which indicates his tender age; for we <lb/>
            look upon the disposition which is inclined to the practice of <lb/>
            virtue, and which is young, as worthy of affection in comparison <lb/>
            of the full-grown man.</p>
          <p>But such a person is worthy to carry off the prizes which <lb/>
            are proposed for children, but he is not yet able to will the <lb/>
            prizes offered for the men. But the best contest for men to <lb/>
            engage in is the service of the only God. Therefore if, even <lb/>
            before we have been completely purified, but while we appear <lb/>
            only to have proceeded so far as to wash off the things which <lb/>
            defile our life, we have arrived at the vestibule of God's service, <lb/>
            we departed again more quickly than we approached, not <lb/>
            being able to endure the austere way of living dictated by that <lb/>
            service, nor the sleepless desire to please God, nor the con­ <lb/>
            tinual and unwearied labour; flee, therefore, at this present <lb/>
            time from what is best and from what is worst. What is worst <lb/>
            are the fabulous inventions, the unmetrical and inharmonious <lb/>
            poems, the conceptions and persuasions which from ignorance <lb/>
            are hard and stubborn, of which Esau is the namesake. What <lb/>
             <pb n="203"/>
            is best is the offering ; for the race inclined to service is an <lb/>
            offering meet for God, being consecrated to him alone in the <lb/>
            great chief priesthood; for to dwell with what is evil is most <lb/>
            pernicious, and to dwell with perfect good is most dangerous. <lb/>
            Accordingly Jacob both flees from Esau, and also dwells apart <lb/>
            from his parents; for being fond of practising virtue and <lb/>
            still labouring at it, he flees from wickedness, and yet is un­ <lb/>
            able to live in company with perfect virtue so as to have no <lb/>
            need of an instructor.</p>
          <p>VIII. On which account we read, " He will depart to <lb/>
            Laban," not to him as the Syrian, but as the brother of his <lb/>
            mother; that is to say, he will go to the brilliancies of life; <lb/>
            for Laban, being interpreted, means " white.'' And when he <lb/>
            has arrived there he will not hold his head too high, from <lb/>
            being puffed up with the happy events of fortune ; for the word <lb/>
            Syrian, being translated, means " sublime." But now he does <lb/>
            not recollect the Syrian Laban, but the brother of Rebekkah ; <lb/>
            for the means of life being given to a bad man, inflate and <lb/>
            raise up to a great height the mind which is devoid of wisdom, <lb/>
            which is called the Syrian ; but if they are bestowed on a lover <lb/>
            of instruction, then they make the mind inclined to abide by <lb/>
            the steady and solid doctrines of virtue and excellence. This is <lb/>
            the brother of Rebekkah, that is to say, of perseverance, and <lb/>
            he dwells in Charran, which name, being interpreted, means <lb/>
            "holes," a symbol of the external senses; for he who is still <lb/>
            moving about in mortal life has need of the organs of the ex­ <lb/>
            ternal senses. " Dwell, therefore," says she, " 0 my child, with <lb/>
            him," not all thy life, but " certain days;" that is to say, learn <lb/>
            to be acquainted with the country of the external senses ; know <lb/>
            thyself and thy own parts, and what each is, and for what end <lb/>
            it was made, and how it is by nature calculated to energise, <lb/>
            and who it is who moves those marvellous things, and pulls <lb/>
            the strings, being himself invisible, in an invisible manner, <lb/>
            whether it is the mind that is in thee, or the mind of the <lb/>
            universe.</p>
          <p>And when you have become thoroughly acquainted with <lb/>
            yourself, then examine accurately also the peculiar qualities of <lb/>
            Laban ; the things which are accounted brilliant instances of <lb/>
            the success of empty glory ; but do not you be deceived by <lb/>
            any one of them, but like a good workman adapt them all in a <lb/>
            skilful manner to your own necessities ; for if, while immersed <lb/>
             <pb n="204"/>
            in this political and much confused life, you display a stable <lb/>
            and well-instructed disposition, I will send for you from thence <lb/>
            that you may receive the same prize which also your parents <lb/>
            received: and the prize is the unchangeable and unhesitating <lb/>
            service of the only wise God.</p>
          <p>IX. And his father also gives him similar precepts, adding <lb/>
            a few trifling injunctions ; for he says, " Rise up and flee into <lb/>
            Mesopotamia, to the house of Bethuel, the father of thy <lb/>
            mother, and from thence take a wife to thyself of the daughters <lb/>
            of Laban thy mother's brother."* Again, he also forbears to <lb/>
            speak of Laban as a Syrian, but he calls him Rebekkah's <lb/>
            brother, who is about to form a connection with the practiser of <lb/>
            virtue by means of intermarriage.</p>
          <p>Flee, therefore, into Mesopotamia, that is to say, into the <lb/>
            middle of the rapid torrent of life, and take care not to be <lb/>
            washed away and swollowed up by its whirlpools, but standing <lb/>
            firmly, vigorously repel the violent, impetuous course of affairs <lb/>
            which overflows and rushes upon thee from above, from both <lb/>
            sides, and from every quarter ; for you will find the house of <lb/>
            wisdom a calm and secure haven, which will gladly receive <lb/>
            you when you are anchored within it.</p>
          <p>But Bethuel in the sacred scriptures is called wisdom; and <lb/>
            this name, being translated, means " the daughter of God <lb/>
            and the legitimate daughter, always a virgin, having received <lb/>
            a nature which shall never be touched or defiled, both on <lb/>
            account of her own orderly decency, and also because of the <lb/>
            high dignity of her Father. And he calls Bethuel the <lb/>
            father of Rebekkah. How, then, can the daughter of God, <lb/>
            namely, wisdom, be properly called a father ? is it because the <lb/>
            name indeed of wisdom is feminine but the sex masculine ? <lb/>
            For indeed all the virtues bear the names of women, but have <lb/>
            the powers and actions of most full-grown men, since whatever <lb/>
            is subsequent to God, even if it be the most ancient of all <lb/>
            other things, still has only the second place when compared <lb/>
            with that omnipotent Being, and appears not so much mascu­ <lb/>
            line as feminine, in accordance with its likeness to the other <lb/>
            creatures; for as the male always has the precedence, the <lb/>
            female falls short, and is inferior in rank.</p>
          <p>We say, therefore, without paying any attention to the <lb/>
            difference here existing in the names, that wisdom, the <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xxviii. 2. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="205"/>
            daughter of good, is both male and a father, and that it is that <lb/>
            which sows the seed of, and which begets learning in, souls, <lb/>
            and also education, and knowledge, and prudence, all honour­ <lb/>
            able and praiseworthy things. And from this source it is that <lb/>
            Jacob, the practiser of wisdom, seeks to procure a wife for <lb/>
            himself; for from what other quarter should he seek a partner <lb/>
            rather than from the house of wisdom ? and where else should <lb/>
            he find an opinion free from all reproach, with which to live <lb/>
            all his life ?....*</p>
          <p>X. But Moses has spoken more accurately about flights <lb/>
            when he was establishing the law with respect to homicides, <lb/>
            in which lie goes through every species of homicide, that of <lb/>
            intentional murder, that of unintentional slaying, that of <lb/>
            murder by deliberate attack, or by crafty treachery. Repeat <lb/>
            the law : " If any man strike another and he die, the striker <lb/>
            shall die the death. And if a man do it not intentionally, <lb/>
            but if God delivers him into his hand, then I will give thee <lb/>
            a place to which he who has slain another shall flee. And if <lb/>
            any one set upon his neighbour to slay him by treachery, and <lb/>
            flee away, thou shalt drag him even from the altar to put him <lb/>
            to death."t Knowing very well that the law is here adding no <lb/>
            superfluous word from any indescribable impetuosity in its <lb/>
            description of the matter, I doubted within myself why it does <lb/>
            not merely say that he who has slain another shall die, and <lb/>
            why it has added, that he shall die the death; for how else <lb/>
            does any one die, who dies at all, except dying the death ?</p>
          <p>Therefore, betaking myself for instruction to a wise woman, <lb/>
            whose name is Consideration, I was released from my difficulty, <lb/>
            for she taught me that some persons who are living are dead, <lb/>
            and that some who are dead still live : she pronounced that <lb/>
            the wicked, even if they arrive at the latest period of old age, <lb/>
            are only dead, inasmuch as they are deprived of life according <lb/>
            to virtue; but that the good, even if they are separated from <lb/>
            all union with the body, live for ever, inasmuch as they have <lb/>
            received an immortal portion.</p>
          <p>XI. Moreover, she confirmed this opinion of hers by the <lb/>
            sacred scriptures, one of which ran in this form : " You who <lb/>
            cleave unto the Lord your God are all alive to this day:" ‡ for <lb/>
            she saw that those who sought refuge with God and became <note type="footnote"> * The rest of this chapter is lost. </note><note type="footnote"> t Exodus roi. 12. </note> <note type="footnote"> ‡ Deuteronomy iv. 4. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="206"/>
            his suppliants, were the only living persons, and that all <lb/>
            others were dead. And Moses, it seems, testifies to the <lb/>
            immortality of those persons, when he adds, " You are all <lb/>
            alive to this day;" and this day is interminable eternity, from <lb/>
            which there is no departure ; for the periods of months, and <lb/>
            years, and, in short, all the divisions of time, are only the <lb/>
            inventions of men doing honour to number. But the unerring <lb/>
            proper name of eternity is " to-day ; " for the sun is always the <lb/>
            same, without ever changing, going at one time beneath the <lb/>
            earth, and at another time above the earth, and by him it <lb/>
            is that day and night, the measures of time, are distinguished.</p>
          <p>She also confirmed her statement by another passage in <lb/>
            scripture of the following purport: " Behold, I have set <lb/>
            before thy face life and death, good and evil."* Therefore, 0 <lb/>
            all-wise man, good and virtue mean life, and evil and wicked­ <lb/>
            ness mean death. And in another passage we read, " This is <lb/>
            thy life, and thy length of days, to love the Lord thy God."t <lb/>
            This is the most admirable definition of immortal life, to be <lb/>
            occupied by a love and affection for God unembarrassed by <lb/>
            any connection with the flesh or with the body. Thus, the <lb/>
            priests, Nadab and Abihu, die in order that they may live ; <lb/>
            taking an immortal existence in exchange for this mortal life, <lb/>
            and departing from the creature to the uncreated God. And <lb/>
            it is with reference to this fact that the symbols of incorrupti­ <lb/>
            bility are thus celebrated: " Then they died before the <lb/>
            Lord; "t that is to say, they lived ; for it is not lawful for any <lb/>
            dead person to come into the sight of the Lord.</p>
          <p>And again, this is what the Lord himself has said, " I will <lb/>
            be sanctified in those who come nigh unto me."§ " But the <lb/>
            dead," as it is also said in the Psalms, " shall not praise the <lb/>
            Lord,"|| for that is the work of the living; but Cain, that <lb/>
            shameless man, that fratricide, is no where spoken of in the <lb/>
            Jaw as dying; but there is an oracle delivered respecting him <lb/>
            in such words as these: " The Lord God put a mark upon <lb/>
            Cain, as a sign that no one who found him should kill him."¶ <lb/>
            Why so? Because, I imagine, wickedness is an evil which <lb/>
            can never end, but which is kindled and is never able to be <note type="footnote"> * Deuteronomy xxx. 15. </note><note type="footnote"> ‡ Leviticu x. 2. </note><note type="footnote"> || Psalm cxiii. 25. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Deuteronomy xxx. 20. </note><note type="footnote"> § Leviticus x. 3. </note><note type="footnote"> ¶ Genesis iv.

             <pb n="207"/>
            extinguished ; so that the lines of the poet may well be applied <lb/>
            to wickedness- <lb/>
            And she is of no mortal race, <lb/>
            But an immortal foul disgrace. <lb/>
            Immortal, indeed, as to the life among us on earth, since <lb/>
            with reference to the life with God it is lifeless and dead, and <lb/>
            as some one has said, more worthless and odious than dung.</p>
          <p>XII. But it was by all means necessary that different <lb/>
            regions should be assigned to different things, the heaven <lb/>
            to good things, the earth to what is evil; for the tendency <lb/>
            of good is to soar on high, and if it ever comes down to us, <lb/>
            for its Father is very bounteous, it still is very justly <lb/>
            anxious to return again to heaven. But evil remains here, <lb/>
            living at the greatest possible distance from the divine choir, <lb/>
            always hovering around mortal life, and unable to die from <lb/>
            among the human race. This, too, one of the most eminent <lb/>
            among the men who have been admired for their wisdom has <lb/>
            asserted, speaking in a magnificent strain in the Theætetus, <lb/>
            where he says, " But it is impossible for evils to come to <lb/>
            an end. For it is indispensable that there should always be <lb/>
            something in opposition to God. And it is equally impos­ <lb/>
            sible that it should have its place in the divine regions; but it <lb/>
            must of necessity hover around mortal nature and this place <lb/>
            where we live ; on which account we ought to endeavour to <lb/>
            flee from this place as speedily as possible. And our flight <lb/>
            will be a likening of ourselves to God, to the best of our <lb/>
            power. And such a likening consists of being just and holy in <lb/>
            conjunction with prudence."* Very naturally, therefore, Cain, <lb/>
            the symbol of wickedness, will not die, for wickedness must of <lb/>
            necessity be always alive in the mortal race of mankind; so <lb/>
            that the expression, " to die the death," is not incorrectly <lb/>
            spoken of the homicide, for the reasons which have here been <lb/>
            given.</p>
          <p>XIII. And the expression, " not intentionally, but if God <lb/>
            deliver him into his hand," is used with exceeding propriety <lb/>
            with reference to those who commit an unintentional homi­ <lb/>
            cide ; for it seems to Moses here, that our intentional actions <lb/>
            are the fruit of our own mind and will, but that our uninten­ <lb/>
            tional actions proceed from the will of God. T mean by this, <lb/>
            not our sins, but, on the contrary, those things which are the <note type="footnote"> -It Plato. Theætetus, p. 176. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="208"/>
            punishment of our sins; for it is not becoming for God himself <lb/>
            to inflict punishment, as being the first and most excellent <lb/>
            Lawgiver; but he punishes by the ministry of others, and not <lb/>
            by his own act. It is very suitable to his character that he <lb/>
            himself should bestow his graces, and his free gifts, and his <lb/>
            great benefits, inasmuch as he is by nature good and bountiful. <lb/>
            But it is not fitting that he should inflict his punishments fur­ <lb/>
            ther than by his mere command, inasmuch as he is a king; <lb/>
            but he must act in this by the instrumentality of others, who <lb/>
            are suitable for such purposes.</p>
          <p>And the practiser of virtue, Jacob, bears his testimony in <lb/>
            support of this doctrine of mine, where he says, " The God <lb/>
            who has nourished me from my youth up, the angel who deli­ <lb/>
            vered me from all my evils."* For the more ancient benefits, <lb/>
            those by which the soul is nourished, he attributes to God, but <lb/>
            the more recent ones, which are caused by the errors of the <lb/>
            soul, he attributes to the servant of God. On this account, I <lb/>
            imagine it is, that when Moses was speaking philosophically of <lb/>
            the creation of the world, while he described every thing else as <lb/>
            having been created by God alone, he mentions man alone as <lb/>
            having been made by him in conjunction with other assistants ; <lb/>
            for, says Moses, " God said, Let us make man in our image."t <lb/>
            The expression, " let us make," indicating a plurality of <lb/>
            makers. Here, therefore, the Father is conversing with his <lb/>
            own powers, to whom he has assigned the task of making <lb/>
            the mortal part of our soul, acting in imitation of his own skill <lb/>
            while he was fashioning the rational part within us, thinking <lb/>
            it right that the dominant part within the soul should be the <lb/>
            work of the Ruler of all things, but that the part which is to <lb/>
            be kept in subjection should be made by those who are subject <lb/>
            to him. And he made us of the powers which were subordi­ <lb/>
            nate to him, not only for the reason which has been mentioned, <lb/>
            but also because the soul of man alone was destined to receive <lb/>
            notions of good and of evil, and to choose one of the two, since <lb/>
            it could not adopt both. Therefore, he thought it necessary to <lb/>
            assign the origin of evil to other workmen than himself,-but <lb/>
            to retain the generation of good for himself alone.</p>
          <p>XIV. Oil which account, after Moses had already put in <lb/>
            God's mouth this expression, " Let us make man," as if speak­ <lb/>
            ing to several persons, he adds, as if he were speaking only of <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xlviii. 15. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Genesis i. 26. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="209"/>
            one, " God made man." For, in fact, the one God alone is the <lb/>
            sole Creator of the real man, who is the purest mind; but a <lb/>
            plurality of workmen are the makers of that which is called <lb/>
            man, the being compounded of external senses; for which <lb/>
            reason the especial real man is spoken of with the article ; for <lb/>
            the words of Moses are, " The God made the man that is to <lb/>
            say, he made that reason destitute of species and free from all <lb/>
            admixture. But he speaks of mail in general without the <lb/>
            addition of the article ; for the expression, " Let us make <lb/>
            man," shows that he means the being compounded of irra­ <lb/>
            tional and rational nature.</p>
          <p>In accordance with this he has also not attributed the bless­ <lb/>
            in- of the virtuous and the cursing of the wicked to the same <lb/>
            ministers, though both these offices receive praise. But since <lb/>
            the blessing of the good has the precedence in panegyrics, and <lb/>
            the affixing curses on the wicked is in the second rank of those <lb/>
            who are appointed for these duties (and they are the chiefs, <lb/>
            and leaders of the race, twelve in number, whom it is cus­ <lb/>
            tomary to call the patriarchs), he has assigned the better six, <lb/>
            who are the best for the task of blessing, namely, Simeon, <lb/>
            Levi, Judah, Issachar, Joseph, and Benjamin ; and the others <lb/>
            he has appointed for the curses, namely, the first and last sons <lb/>
            of Leah, Reuben, and Zabulon, and the four bastard sons by <lb/>
            the handmaidens ; for the chiefs of the royal tribe, and of the <lb/>
            tribe consecrated to the priesthood, Judah and Levi, are <lb/>
            reckoned in the former class.</p>
          <p>Very naturally, therefore, does God give up those who have <lb/>
            done deeds worthy of death to the hands of others for punish­ <lb/>
            ment, wishing to teach us that the nature of evil is banished <lb/>
            to a distance from the divine choir, since even punishment, <lb/>
            which, though a good, has in it some imitation of evil, is con­ <lb/>
            firmed by others. And the expression, " I will give thee a <lb/>
            place to which he who has slain a man unintentionally shall <lb/>
            flee," appears to me to be spoken with exceeding propriety; <lb/>
            for what he calls a place is not a region filled by the body, but <lb/>
            is rather, in a figure, God himself, because he, surrounding all <lb/>
            things, is not surrounded himself, and because he is that to <lb/>
            which all things flee for refuge. It is proper, therefore, for <lb/>
            him who appears to have been involuntarily changed to say <lb/>
            that this change has come upon him by the divine will, just as <lb/>
            it is not proper for him to say so who has done evil of his <note type="footnote"> VOL. II. </note> <note type="footnote"> r </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="210"/>
            own accord; and lie says that he will give this place, not to <lb/>
            him who has slain the man, but to him with whom he is con­ <lb/>
            versing, so that the inhabitant of it shall be one person, but <lb/>
            he who flees to it for refuge another; for God has given his <lb/>
            own word a country to inhabit, namely, his own knowledge, as <lb/>
            if it were a native of it. But to the man who is under the <lb/>
            pollution of involuntary error he has given a foreign home as <lb/>
            to a stranger, not a country as to a citizen.</p>
          <p>XV, Having now said thus much in a philosophical spirit <lb/>
            with respect to involuntary offences, he proceeds to legislate <lb/>
            concerning the man who rises up to attack another, or who <lb/>
            treacherously plots his death, saying, " But if any one attacks <lb/>
            his neighbour so as to slay him by treachery, and he flees to <lb/>
            God," that is to say to the place which has already been spoken <lb/>
            of under a figure, from which life is given to all men. For he <lb/>
            says also in another passage: " Whosoever shall flee thither <lb/>
            shall live." But is not everlasting life a fleeing for refuge to the <lb/>
            living God ? and is not a fleeing from his presence death ? <lb/>
            But if anyone sets upon another, he by all means is committing <lb/>
            iniquity by deliberate purpose, and that which is done with <lb/>
            treachery is liable to be accounted among voluntary actions, <lb/>
            just as, on the other hand, that which is done without treachery <lb/>
            is not subject to blame. There is nothing therefore of the <lb/>
            wicked actions which are done secretly, and treacherously, and <lb/>
            of malice aforethought, which we can properly say are done <lb/>
            through the will of God, but they are done only through our <lb/>
            own will. For, as I have said before, the storehouses of <lb/>
            wickedness are in us ourselves, and those of good alone are <lb/>
            with God.</p>
          <p>Whosoever therefore flees for refuge, that is to say, whoso­ <lb/>
            ever accuses not himself, but God as the cause of his offence, <lb/>
            let him be punished, being deprived of that refuge to the altar <lb/>
            which tends to salvation and security, and which is meant for <lb/>
            suppliants alone. And is not this proper ? For the altar is <lb/>
            full of victims, in which there is no spot, I mean of innocent <lb/>
            and thoroughly purified souls. But to pronounce the Deity the <lb/>
            cause of evil is a spot which it is hard to cure, or rather which <lb/>
            is altogether incurable.</p>
          <p>Those who have cultivated such a disposition as to be lovers <lb/>
            of themselves rather than lovers of God, may remain at a <lb/>
            distance from the sacred places, in order that as polluted and <lb/>
             <pb n="211"/>
            impure persons, they may not behold, not even from a distance, <lb/>
            the sacred flame of the evil which is unextinguishably set on <lb/>
            fire, and purified, and dedicated to God with entire and perfect <lb/>
            power. Very beautifully, therefore, did one of the wise men of <lb/>
            old, hastening on to this same conclusion, find confidence to say <lb/>
            that " God is in no respect and in no place unjust, but he is <lb/>
            the most righteous being possible. There is nothing that more <lb/>
            nearly resembles him than the man who is as just as possible. <lb/>
            Around is the strength, and the real ability, and power of man, <lb/>
            and also nothingness and unmanliness. For the knowledge of <lb/>
            him is wisdom and true virtue ; but the ignorance of him is real <lb/>
            ignorance and manifest wickedness. And all other things <lb/>
            which appear to be cleverness or wisdom, if they be displayed <lb/>
            in political affairs are troublesome, and if in acts, are sordid.*</p>
          <p>XVI. Therefore, having further commanded the unholy man <lb/>
            who is a speaker of evil against divine things to be removed <lb/>
            from the most holy places and to be given up to punishment, <lb/>
            he proceeds to say, " Whosoever hateth his father or his <lb/>
            mother, let him die."† And in a similar strain he says, "He <lb/>
            who accuseth his father or his mother, let him die." He here <lb/>
            all but cries out and shouts that there is no pardon whatever <lb/>
            to be given to those who blaspheme the Deity. For if they <lb/>
            who bring accusations against their mortal parents are led <lb/>
            away to death, what punishment must we think that those <lb/>
            men deserve who venture to blaspheme the Father and Creator <lb/>
            of the universe ? And what accusation can be more dis­ <lb/>
            graceful than to say that the origin of evil is not in us but in <lb/>
            God ? Drive away, therefore, drive away, 0 ye who have <lb/>
            been initiated in, and who are the hierophants of, the sacred <lb/>
            mysteries, drive away, I say, the souls which are mixed and <lb/>
            in a confused crowd, and brought together promiscuously from <lb/>
            all quarters, those unpurified and still polluted souls, which <lb/>
            have their ears not closed, and their tongues unrestrained, and <lb/>
            which bear about all the instruments of their misery ready <lb/>
            prepared, in order that they may hear all things, even those <lb/>
            which it is not lawful to hear. But they who have been <lb/>
            instructed in the difference between voluntary and involuntary <lb/>
            offences, and who have received a tongue which speaketh good <lb/>
            things instead of one which delighteth in accusation, when <lb/>
            they do right are to be praised, and when they err contrary to <note type="footnote"> * Plato. Theœtetus, p. 176. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Exodus xxi 15. </note> <note type="footnote"> P 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="212"/>
            their intention, they are not greatly to be blamed, for which <lb/>
            reason cities have been set apart for them to flee unto for <lb/>
            refuge.</p>
          <p>XVII. And it is worth while to examine with all the accu­ <lb/>
            racy possible into some necessary points relating to this place. <lb/>
            They are four in number. One, why it is that the cities which <lb/>
            were set apart for the fugitives were not chosen out of those <lb/>
            cities which the other tribes received as their portion, but <lb/>
            only out of those which were assigned to the tribe of Levi. <lb/>
            The second point is, why they were six in number, and neither <lb/>
            more nor fewer. The third is, why three of them were beyond <lb/>
            Jordan, and the other three in the land of the Canaanites. <lb/>
            The fourth is, why the death of the high priest was appointed <lb/>
            to the fugitives as a limit, after which they might return. We <lb/>
            must, therefore, say what is suitable on each of these heads, <lb/>
            beginning with the first in order.</p>
          <p>It is with exceeding propriety that the command is given to <lb/>
            flee only to those cities which had been assigned to the <lb/>
            tribe of Levi; for the Levites themselves are in a manner <lb/>
            fugitives, inasmuch as they, for the sake of pleasing God, <lb/>
            have left parents, and children, and brethren, and all their <lb/>
            mortal relations. Therefore the original leader of this com­ <lb/>
            pany is represented as saying to his father and mother, " I <lb/>
            have not seen you, and my brethren I do not know, and my <lb/>
            sons I disown,"* in order to be able to serve the living God <lb/>
            without allowing any opposite attraction to draw him away. <lb/>
            But real flight is a deprivation of all that is nearest and <lb/>
            dearest to a man. And it introduces one fugitive to another, <lb/>
            so as to make them forget what they have done by reason of <lb/>
            the similarity of their actions. Either, therefore, it is for this <lb/>
            reason alone, or perhaps for this other also, that the Levitical <lb/>
            tribe of the persons set apart for the service of the temple ran <lb/>
            up, and at one onset slew those who had made a god of the <lb/>
            golden calf, the pride of Egypt, killing all who had arrived at <lb/>
            the age of puberty, being inflamed with righteous anger, com­ <lb/>
            bined with enthusiasm, and a certain heaven-sent inspiration: <lb/>
            " And every one slew his brother, and his neighbour, and him <lb/>
            that was nearest to him."t The body being the brother of the <lb/>
            soul, and the irrational part the neighbour of the rational, and <lb/>
            the uttered speech that which is nearest to the mind. <note type="footnote"> * Deuteronomy xxxiii. 9. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Exodus xxxii. 26. </note> <pb n="213"/>
            </p>
          <p>For by the following means alone can that which is most <lb/>
            excellent within us become adapted for and inclined to the <lb/>
            service of him who is the most excellent of all existing beings. <lb/>
            In the first place, if man be resolved into soul, the body, <lb/>
            which is akin to it as a brother, being separated and cut off <lb/>
            from it, and also all its insatiable desires; and in the second <lb/>
            place when the soul has, as I have already said, cast off the <lb/>
            irrational part, which is the neighbour of the rational part; for <lb/>
            this, like a torrent, being divided into five channels, excites <lb/>
            the impetuosity of the passions through all the external senses, <lb/>
            as so many aqueducts. Then, in regular order, the reason <lb/>
            removes to a distance and separates the uttered speech which <lb/>
            appeared to be the nearest to it of all things, in order that <lb/>
            speech, according to the intention, might alone be left, free <lb/>
            from the body, free from the entanglements of the outward <lb/>
            senses, and free from all uttered speech; for when it is left in <lb/>
            this manner existing in a solitary manner, it will embrace <lb/>
            that which alone is to be embraced with purity, and in such a <lb/>
            way that it cannot be drawn away.</p>
          <p>In addition to what has been said above, we must also <lb/>
            mention this point, that the tribe of Levi is the tribe of the <lb/>
            ministers of the temple and of the priests, to whom the <lb/>
            service and ministration of holy things is assigned; and they <lb/>
            also perform sacred service who have committed unintentional <lb/>
            homicide, since, according to Moses, " God gives into their <lb/>
            hands"* those who have done things worthy of death, with a <lb/>
            view to their execution. But it is the duty of the one body <lb/>
            to know the good, and of the other body to chastise the <lb/>
            wicked.</p>
          <p>XVIII. These then are the reasons on account of which <lb/>
            they who have committed unintentional homicide fly only to <lb/>
            those cities which belong to the ministers of the temple. We <lb/>
            must now proceed to mention what these cities are, and why <lb/>
            they are six in number. Perhaps we may say that the most <lb/>
            ancient, and the strongest, and the most excellent metropolis, <lb/>
            for I may not call it merely a city, is the divine word, to flee <lb/>
            to which first is the most advantageous course of all. But the <lb/>
            other five, being as it were colonies of that one, are the powers <lb/>
            of Him who utters the word, the chief of which is his creative <lb/>
            power, according to which the Creator made the world with a <note type="footnote"> * Exodus xxi. 31. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="214"/>
            word ; the second is his kingly power, according to which he <lb/>
            who has created rules over what is created ; the third is his <lb/>
            merciful power, in respect of which the Creator pities and <lb/>
            shows mercy towards his own work ; the fourth is his legis­ <lb/>
            lative power, by which he forbids what may not be done. <lb/>
            * * * * * <lb/>
            And these are very beautiful and most excellently fenced <lb/>
            cities, the best possible refuge for souls which are worthy to <lb/>
            be saved for ever; and the establishment of them is merciful <lb/>
            and humane, calculated to excite men, to aid and to encourage <lb/>
            them in good hopes.</p>
          <p>Who else could more greatly display the exceeding abun­ <lb/>
            dance of his mercy, of all the powers which are able to benefit <lb/>
            us, towards such an exceeding variety of persons who err by <lb/>
            unintentional misdeeds, and who have neither the same <lb/>
            strength nor the same weakness ? Therefore he exhorts him <lb/>
            who is able to run swiftly to strain onwards, without stopping <lb/>
            to take breath, to the highest word of God, which is the <lb/>
            fountain of wisdom, in order that by drinking of that stream <lb/>
            he may find everlasting life instead of death. But he urges <lb/>
            him who is not so swift of foot to flee for refuge to the creative <lb/>
            power which Moses calls God, since it is by that power that <lb/>
            all things were made and arranged; for to him who compre­ <lb/>
            hends that everything has been created, that comprehension <lb/>
            alone, and the knowledge of the Creator, is a great acquisition <lb/>
            of good, which immediately persuades the creature to love <lb/>
            him who created it. Him, again, who is still less ready he <lb/>
            bids flee to his kingly power ; for that which is in subjection <lb/>
            is corrected by the fear of him who rules it, and by necessity <lb/>
            which keeps it in order, even if the child is not kept in the <lb/>
            right way by love for his father.</p>
          <p>Again, in the case of him who is not able to reach the <lb/>
            boundaries which have been already mentioned, in respect of <lb/>
            their being a long way off, there are other goals appointed for <lb/>
            them at a shorter distance, the cities namely of the necessary <lb/>
            powers, the city of the power of the mercy, the city of the <lb/>
            power which enjoins what is right, the city of the power which <lb/>
            forbids what is not right: for he who is already persuaded <lb/>
            that the Deity is not implacable, but is merciful by reason of <lb/>
            the gentleness of his nature, then, even if he has previously <lb/>
            sinned, subsequently repents from a hope of pardon. And he who <lb/>
             <pb n="215"/>
            has adopted the notion that God is a lawgiver obeys all the <lb/>
            injunctions which as such he imposes, and so will be happy; <lb/>
            and lie who is last of all will find the last refuge, namely, the <lb/>
            escape from evil, even though he may not be able to arrive at <lb/>
            a participation in the more desirable good things.</p>
          <p>XIX. These, then, are the six cities which Moses calls <lb/>
            cities of refuge, five of which have had their figures set forth <lb/>
            in the sacred scriptures, and their images are there likewise. <lb/>
            The images of the cities of command and prohibition are the <lb/>
            laws in the ark; that of the merciful power of God is the <lb/>
            covering of the ark, and he calls it the mercy-seat. The <lb/>
            images of the creative power and of the kingly power are the <lb/>
            winged cherubim which are placed upon it. But the divine <lb/>
            word which is above these does not come into any visible <lb/>
            appearance, inasmuch as it is not like to any of the things <lb/>
            that come under the external senses, but is itself an image of <lb/>
            God, the most ancient of all the objects of intellect in the <lb/>
            whole world, and that which is placed in the closest proximity <lb/>
            to the only truly existing God, without any partition or <lb/>
            distance being interposed between them: for it is said, " I <lb/>
            will speak unto thee from above the mercy-seat, in the midst, <lb/>
            between the two cherubim."* So that the word is, as it were, <lb/>
            the charioteer of the powers, and he who utters it is the rider, <lb/>
            who directs the charioteer how to proceed with a view to the <lb/>
            proper guidance of the universe.</p>
          <p>Therefore, he who is so far removed from committing any <lb/>
            intentional misdeeds, that he is even free from all uninten­ <lb/>
            tional offence, will have God himself for his inheritance, and <lb/>
            will dwell in him alone. But those who fall into errors which <lb/>
            proceed not from wilful purpose, but which are done without <lb/>
            premeditation, will have the aforesaid places of refuge in all <lb/>
            abundance and fulness.</p>
          <p>Now of the cities of refuge there are three on the other side <lb/>
            of Jordan, which are at a great distance from our race. What <lb/>
            cities are they? The word of the Governor of the universe, <lb/>
            and his creative power, and his kingly power: for to these <lb/>
            belong the heaven and the whole world. But those which, as <lb/>
            it were, participate in us, and which are near to us, and which <lb/>
            almost touch the unfortunate race of mankind which is alone <lb/>
            capable of sinning, are the three on this side of the river; the <note type="footnote"> * Exodus xxv. 22. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="216"/>
            merciful power, the power -which enjoins what is to be done. <lb/>
            the power which prohibits what ought not to be done: for <lb/>
            these powers touch us. For what need can there be of pro­ <lb/>
            hibition to persons who are not likely to do wrong ? And what <lb/>
            need of injunction to people who are not by nature inclined to <lb/>
            stumble ? And what need of mercy can those persons have <lb/>
            who will absolutely never do wrong at all ? But our race of <lb/>
            mankind has need of all these things because it is by nature <lb/>
            inclined and liable to offences both voluntary and involuntary.</p>
          <p>XX. The fourth and last of the points which we proposed <lb/>
            to discuss, is the appointing as a period for the return of the <lb/>
            fugitives the death of the high priest, which, if taken in the <lb/>
            literal sense, causes me great perplexity; for a very unequal <lb/>
            punishment is imposed by this enactment on those who have <lb/>
            done the very same things, since some will be in banishment <lb/>
            for a longer time, and others for a shorter time; for some of <lb/>
            the high priests live to a very old age, and others die very <lb/>
            early, and some are appointed while young men, and others <lb/>
            not until they are old. And again of those who are convicted <lb/>
            of unintentional homicide, some have been banished 'at the <lb/>
            beginning of the high priest's entrance into office, and some <lb/>
            when the high priest has been at the very point of death. So <lb/>
            that some are deprived of their country for a very long time, <lb/>
            and others suffer the same infliction only for a day, if it <lb/>
            chance to be so; after which they lift up their heads, and <lb/>
            exult, and so return among those whose nearest relations have <lb/>
            been slain by them.</p>
          <p>This difficult and scarcely explicable perplexity we may <lb/>
            escape if we adopt the inner and allegorical explanation in <lb/>
            accordance with natural philosophy. For we say that the <lb/>
            high priest is not a man, but is the word of God, who has not <lb/>
            only no participation in intentional errors, but none even in <lb/>
            those which are involuntary. For Moses says that he cannot <lb/>
            be defiled neither in respect of his father, that is, the mind, <lb/>
            nor of his mother, that is, the external sense ;* because, I <lb/>
            imagine, he has received imperishable and wholly pure parents, <lb/>
            God being his father, who is also the father of all things, <lb/>
            and wisdom being his mother, by means of whom the universe <lb/>
            arrived at creation; and also because he is anointed with oil, <lb/>
            by which I mean that the principal part of him is illuminated <note type="footnote">* Leviticus xxi. 11. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="217"/>
            with a light like the beams of the sun, so as to be thought <lb/>
            worthy to be clothed with garments.</p>
          <p>And the most ancient word of the living God is clothed <lb/>
            with the word as with a garment, for it has put on earth, and <lb/>
            water, and air, and fire, and the things which proceed from <lb/>
            these elements. But the particular soul is clothed with the <lb/>
            body, and the mind of the wise man is clothed with the <lb/>
            virtues. And it is said that he will never take the mitre off <lb/>
            from his head, he will never lay aside the kingly diadem, the <lb/>
            symbol of an authority which is not indeed absolute, but only <lb/>
            that of a viceroy, but which is nevertheless an object of <lb/>
            admiration. Nor will he "rend his clothes ;” for the word cf <lb/>
            the living God being the bond of every thing, as has been said <lb/>
            before, holds all things together, and binds all the parts, and <lb/>
            prevents them from being loosened or separated.</p>
          <p>And the particular soul, as far as it has received power, does <lb/>
            not permit any of the parts of the body to be separated or <lb/>
            cut off contrary to their nature; but as far as depends upon <lb/>
            itself, it preserves every thing entire, and conducts the differ­ <lb/>
            ent parts to a harmony and indissoluble union with one <lb/>
            another. But the mind of the wise mail being thoroughly <lb/>
            purified, preserves the virtues in an unbroken and unimpaired <lb/>
            condition, having adapted their natural kindred and commu­ <lb/>
            nion with a still more solid good will.</p>
          <p>XXI. This high priest, as Moses says, "shall not enter into <lb/>
            any soul that is dead." But the death of the soul is a life <lb/>
            according to wickedness; so that he must never touch any <lb/>
            pollution such as folly is fond of dealing with. And to him <lb/>
            also " a virgin of the sacred race is joined ;” that is to say, an <lb/>
            opinion for ever pure, and undefiled, and imperishable; for <lb/>
            he " may never become the husband of a widow, or of one who <lb/>
            has been divorced, or of one who is a profane person, or of one <lb/>
            who is a harlot," since he is always proclaiming an endless <lb/>
            and irreconcileable war against them. For it is a hateful <lb/>
            thing to him to be widowed with respect to virtue, and to be <lb/>
            divorced and driven away by her; and in like manner all per­ <lb/>
            suasion of this kind is profane and unholy.</p>
          <p>But that promiscuous evil abandoned to many husbands, <lb/>
            and to the worship of many gods, that is, a harlot, he does not <lb/>
            think fit even to look upon, being content with her who has <lb/>
            chosen for herself one husband and father only, the all-govern­ <lb/>
             <pb n="218"/>
            ing God. There is a certain extravagance of perfection visible <lb/>
            in this disposition. He has known* the man who has vowed <lb/>
            the great vow in some instances offending unintentionally, <lb/>
            even if not of deliberate purpose ; for he says, " But if any one <lb/>
            die before him suddenly, he shall be at once polluted." For <lb/>
            if of things without deliberation anything coming from without <lb/>
            strikes down suddenly, such things do at once pollute the soul, <lb/>
            but not with a pollution which remains for any length of time, <lb/>
            inasmuch as they are unintentional actions. And about these <lb/>
            actions the high priest (standing above them, as he also does <lb/>
            above those which are voluntary) is indifferent.</p>
          <p>But I am not saying this at random, but for the sake of <lb/>
            proving that the period of the death of the high priest is a <lb/>
            most natural termination of exile to be appointed by the law, <lb/>
            so as to allow of the return of the fugitives. As long, there­ <lb/>
            fore. as this most sacred word lives and survives in the soul, it <lb/>
            is impossible for any involuntary error to enter into it; for it <lb/>
            is by nature so framed as to have no participation in, and to <lb/>
            be incapable of admitting any kind of error. But if it dies <lb/>
            (not meaning by this that it is itself destroyed, but that it is <lb/>
            separated from our soul), then a return is at once granted to <lb/>
            intentional offences. For if while the word remained and was <lb/>
            healthy in us, error was driven to a distance, by all means, <lb/>
            when the word departs, error will be introduced. For the <lb/>
            undefiled high priest, conscience, has derived from nature this <lb/>
            most especial honour, that no error of the mind can find any <lb/>
            place within him; on which account it is worth our while to <lb/>
            pray that the high priest may live in the soul, being at the <lb/>
            same time both a judge and a convictor, who having received <lb/>
            jurisdiction over the whole of our minds, is not altered in his <lb/>
            appearance or purpose by any of those things which are brought <lb/>
            under his judgment.</p>
          <p>XXII. Having now, therefore, said what was proper on the <lb/>
            subject of fugitives, we will proceed with what follows in the <lb/>
            regular order of the context. In the first place it is said, <lb/>
            “The angel of the Lord found her in the way,"* pitying the <lb/>
            soul which out of modesty had voluntarily committed the <note type="footnote"> * There is some obscurity in the sense here. Mangey proposes <lb/>
            instead of <foreign xml:lang="grc">οι̃δέ που</foreign>, to read <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὺδέπου</foreign>, but it does not seem any more <lb/>
            intelligible than that in the text. </note><note type="footnote"> t Genesis xvi. 7. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="219"/>
            danger of wandering about, and very nearly becoming a con­ <lb/>
            ductor of her return to opinion void of error. It is desirable <lb/>
            also not to pass over in silence the things which are said in a <lb/>
            philosophical strain by the lawgiver on the subject of discovery <lb/>
            and investigation; for he represents some persons as neither <lb/>
            investigating nor discovering anything, others as succeeding <lb/>
            in both these paths, others as having chosen only one of them; <lb/>
            of which last class some who seek do not find, and others find <lb/>
            without having sought.</p>
          <p>Those, then, who have no desire for either discovery or <lb/>
            investigation have shamefully debased their reason by ignorance <lb/>
            and indifference, and though they had it in their power to see <lb/>
            acutely, they have become blind. Thus he says that " Lot's <lb/>
            wife turning backwards became a pillar of salt not here <lb/>
            inventing a fable, but pointing out the proper nature of the <lb/>
            event.</p>
          <p>For whoever despises his teacher, and under the influence <lb/>
            of an innate and habitual indolence forsakes what is in front <lb/>
            of him, by means of which it may be in his power to see, and <lb/>
            to hear, and to exert his other powers, so as to form a judg­ <lb/>
            ment in things of nature, and turns his head round so as to <lb/>
            keep his eyes on what is behind him, that man has an admi. <lb/>
            ration for blindness in the affairs of life, as well as in the <lb/>
            parts of the body, and becomes a pillar, like a lifeless and <lb/>
            senseless stone. For, as Moses says, " such men have not <lb/>
            hearts to understand, nor eyes to see, nor ears to hear,"t <lb/>
            but make the whole of their life blind, and deaf, and senseless <lb/>
            and mutilated in every respect, so as not to be worth living, <lb/>
            caring for none of those matters which deserve their attention.</p>
          <p>XXIII. And the leader of this company is the king of the <lb/>
            region of the body. “For,” says Moses, ., Pharaoh turned <lb/>
            himself about and went into his house, and did not set his <lb/>
            heart to this thing either,”‡ which statement is equivalent to, <lb/>
            he did not take notice of anything whatever, but allowed him­ <lb/>
            self to become dried up like a plant which has no care taken <lb/>
            of it by the farmer, and to lose his fertility and become barren. <lb/>
            Those then who take counsel, and consider matters, and who <lb/>
            investigate everything carefully, sharpen and rouse their <lb/>
            minds: and the mind being duly exercised bears its appro­ <lb/>
            priate fruit of cleverness and intelligence, by means of which <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xix. 26 </note> <note type="footnote"> † Deut. xxix. 4. </note> <note type="footnote"> ‡ Exodus vii. 23. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="220"/>
            the power of repelling all deceitful things is acquired. But <lb/>
            the man who is an enemy to consideration blunts and breaks <lb/>
            the edges of his wisdom; we must therefore discard the truly <lb/>
            senseless and lifeless company of such men as these, and choose <lb/>
            those who exert their powers of consideration and discovery.</p>
          <p>And presently the political disposition is introduced, which, <lb/>
            without being at all over ambitious of glory, has a desire for <lb/>
            that better generation, which the virtues have received as <lb/>
            their inheritance, and which consequently seeks and finds it; <lb/>
            for, says the scripture, " A man found Joseph in the plain, <lb/>
            and asked him saying, What seekest thou ; and he said, I am <lb/>
            seeking my brothers; tell me where they are feeding their <lb/>
            flocks : and the man said unto him, They are departed from <lb/>
            hence ; for I heard them saying, Let us go into Dothan ; and <lb/>
            Joseph went after his brethren and found them in Dothan."* <lb/>
            The name Dothan is interpreted, " a sufficient abandonment," <lb/>
            being a symbol of the soul which has in no slight degree but <lb/>
            altogether escaped those vain opinions, which resemble the <lb/>
            pursuits of women rather than those of men. On which <lb/>
            account virtue, that is Sarah, is very beautifully described as <lb/>
            having given up "the manner of women,”† which is the <lb/>
            object of pursuit to those men who live an unmanly and truly <lb/>
            feminine life. But the wise man is also " added when leav­ <lb/>
            ing,"‡ according to Moses, speaking most strictly in accord­ <lb/>
            ance with nature. For the deprivation of empty opinion must <lb/>
            necessarily be the addition of true opinion.</p>
          <p>But if any one, passing his days in a mortal, and promiscuous, <lb/>
            and variously formed life, and having abundant resources of <lb/>
            wealth and riches, considers and inquires concerning that <lb/>
            better generation which looks only to what is good, he is <lb/>
            worthy of being received, if the dreams and visions of those <lb/>
            things, which are fancied to be and which appear to be good, <lb/>
            do not again overwhelm him and immerse him in luxury. <lb/>
            For if he abides in contemplation of the soul without any <lb/>
            adulteration, proceeding and following in the track of the <lb/>
            things which he is seeking, he will never give up his search <lb/>
            till he has attained to the objects of his wishes ; but he will <lb/>
            find none of the things which he desires among the wicked. <lb/>
            Why not ? Because they departed from hence. Having <lb/>
            abandoned the studies of our friends they have changed their <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xxxvii. 15. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Genesis xviii. 11. </note> <note type="footnote"> ‡ Genesis xxv. 17. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="221"/>
            abode from the country of the pious, and settled in the desert <lb/>
            of the wicked. But the real man, the convictor that dwells in <lb/>
            the soul says this, who when he sees the soul in perplexity, <lb/>
            and considering and investigating deeply, exerts a prudent <lb/>
            care in its behalf, that it may not wander and so miss the <lb/>
            right road.</p>
          <p>XXIV. I very greatly wonder at those persons also, I mean <lb/>
            at him who is fond of asking questions about what is in the <lb/>
            middle between two extremes, and who says, " Behold the fire <lb/>
            and the wood, but where is the lamb for the burnt offering ?''* <lb/>
            And also at him who answers, " My son, God will provide <lb/>
            himself a lamb for a burnt offering," and who afterwards finds <lb/>
            what is given as a ransom ; " For behold a single ram was <lb/>
            caught by his horns in a shrub of Sabec." Let us therefore <lb/>
            consider what it is that he who is seeking doubts about, and <lb/>
            what he who answers reveals, and in the third place what the <lb/>
            thing is which was found.</p>
          <p>Now what the inquirer asks is something of this kind:- <lb/>
            Behold the efficient cause, the fire ; behold also the passive <lb/>
            part, the material, the wood. Where is the third party, the <lb/>
            thing to be effected ? As if he said,- Behold the mind, the <lb/>
            fervid and kindled spirit; behold also the objects of intelli­ <lb/>
            gence, as it were so much material or fuel; where is the third <lb/>
            thing, the act of perceiving? Or, again,-Behold the sight, <lb/>
            behold the colour, where is the act of seeing ? And, in short, <lb/>
            generally, behold the external sense, behold the thing to be <lb/>
            judged of ; but where are the objects of the external sense, the <lb/>
            material, the exertion of the feeling ? To him who puts these <lb/>
            questions, answer is very properly made, " God will provide for <lb/>
            himself." For the third thing is the peculiar work of God; <lb/>
            for it is owing to his providential arrangement that the mind <lb/>
            comprehends, and the sight sees, and that every external sense <lb/>
            is exerted. “And a ram is found caught by his horns ;” that is <lb/>
            to say, reason is found silent and withholding its assent; for <lb/>
            silence is the most excellent of offerings, and so is a with­ <lb/>
            holding of assent to those matters of which there are not clear <lb/>
            proofs ; therefore this is all that ought to be said, " God will <lb/>
            provide for himself,”—he to whom all things are known, who <lb/>
            illuminates the universe by the most brilliant of all lights, <lb/>
            himself. But the other things are not to be said by creatures <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xxii. 7. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="222"/>
            over whom great darkness is poured ; but quiet is a means of <lb/>
            safety in darkness.</p>
          <p>XXV. Those also who have inquired what it is that <lb/>
            nourishes the soul, for as Moses says, “They knew not what <lb/>
            it was,” learnt at last and found that it was the word of God <lb/>
            and the divine reason, from which flow all kinds of instinctive <lb/>
            and everlasting wisdom. This is the heavenly nourishment <lb/>
            which the holy scripture indicates, saying, in the character of <lb/>
            the cause of all things, " Behold I rain upon you bread from <lb/>
            heaven;”* for in real truth it is God who showers down <lb/>
            heavenly wisdom from above upon all the intellects which are <lb/>
            properly disposed for the reception of it, and which are fond of <lb/>
            contemplation. But those who have seen and tasted it, are <lb/>
            exceedingly delighted with it, and understand indeed what <lb/>
            they feel, but do not know what the cause is which has affected <lb/>
            them ; and on this account they inquire, " What is this which <lb/>
            is sweeter than honey and whiter than snow?" And they will <lb/>
            be taught by the interpreter of the divine will, that " This is <lb/>
            the bread which the Lord has given them to eat.”†</p>
          <p>What then is this bread? Tell us. " This," says he, "is <lb/>
            the word which the Lord has appointed." This divine ap­ <lb/>
            pointment at the same time both illuminates and sweetens the <lb/>
            soul, which is endowed with sight, shining upon it with the <lb/>
            beams of truth, and sweetening with the sweet virtue of per­ <lb/>
            suasion those who thirst and hunger after excellence. And <lb/>
            the prophet also having himself inquired what was the cause of <lb/>
            meeting with success, finds it to be associated with the only <lb/>
            God ; for when he was doubting and asking, Who am I, and <lb/>
            what am 1, that I shall deliver the seeing race of Israel from <lb/>
            the disposition hostile to God, which seems to be a king? <lb/>
            He is taught by the oracle that, " I will be with thee." And, <lb/>
            indeed, inquiries into individual matters have a certain ele­ <lb/>
            gant and philosophical kind of meditation in them; for how <lb/>
            can they avoid it? But the inquiry into the nature of God, <lb/>
            the most excellent of all things, who is incomparable, and the <lb/>
            cause of all things, at once delights those who betake themselves <lb/>
            to its consideration, and it is not imperfect inasmuch as lie, out <lb/>
            of his own merciful nature, comes forward to meet it, display­ <lb/>
            ing himself by his virgin graces, and willingly to all those who <lb/>
            are desirous to see him. Not, indeed, such as he is, for that <note type="footnote"> it Exodus xvi. 4. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Exodus xvi. 15. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="223"/>
            is impossible, since Moses also turned away his face,* for he <lb/>
            feared to see God face to face ; but as far as it is possible for <lb/>
            created nature to approach by its own power those things which <lb/>
            are only discernible to the mind. And this also is written <lb/>
            among the hortatory precepts, for, says Moses, " Ye shall turn <lb/>
            unto the Lord your God, and shall find him, when ye seek <lb/>
            him with all your heart, and with all your soul."f</p>
          <p>XXVI. Having now spoken at sufficient length on this <lb/>
            point also, let us proceed in regular order to consider the third <lb/>
            head of our subject, in which the seeking existed, but the <lb/>
            finding did not follow it. At all events Laban, who examined <lb/>
            the entire spiritual house of the practiser of virtue, " did not," <lb/>
            as Moses says, "find the images,”‡ for it was full of real <lb/>
            things, and not of dreams and vain fantasies. Nor did the in­ <lb/>
            habitants of Sodom, blind in their minds, who were insanely <lb/>
            eager to defile the holy and unpolluted reasonings, " find the <lb/>
            road which led to this”§ object; but, as the sacred scriptures <lb/>
            tell us, they were wearied with their exertions to find the door, <lb/>
            although they ran in a circle all round the house, and left no <lb/>
            stone unturned for the accomplishment of their unnatural and <lb/>
            impious desires.</p>
          <p>And before now some persons, wishing to be kings instead <lb/>
            of doorkeepers, and to put an end to the most beautiful thing <lb/>
            in life, namely order, having not only failed in obtaining the <lb/>
            success which they hoped to meet with through injustice, but <lb/>
            have even been compelled to part with that which they had in <lb/>
            their hands; for the law tells us that the companions of <lb/>
            Korah. who coveted the priesthood, lost both what they wished <lb/>
            for and what they had : for as children and men do not learn <lb/>
            the same things, but there are institutions adapted to each <lb/>
            age, so also there are by nature some souls which are always <lb/>
            childish, even though they are in bodies which have grown <lb/>
            old ; and on the other hand, there are some which have arrived <lb/>
            at complete perfection in bodies which are still in the prime <lb/>
            and vigour of early youth.</p>
          <p>But those men will deservedly incur the imputation of folly <lb/>
            who desire objects too great for their own nature, since every­ <lb/>
            thing which is beyond one's power will vanish away through <lb/>
            the intensity of its own vehemence. And so Pharaoh also, <note type="footnote"> * Exodus iii. 6. </note><note type="footnote"> ‡ Genesis xxxi. 33. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Deuteronomy iv. 29. </note><note type="footnote"> § Genesis xix. 11. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="224"/>
            when " seeking to kill Moses,"* the prophetic race, will never <lb/>
            find him, although he has heard that a heavy accusation is <lb/>
            brought against him, as if he has attempted to destroy all the <lb/>
            supreme authority of the body by two attacks, the first of <lb/>
            which he made upon the Egyptian disposition, which was <lb/>
            fortifying pleasure as a citadel against the soul; for " having <lb/>
            smote him," with an accidental instrument that came to hand, <lb/>
            " he buried him in the sand,” † thinking that the two doctrines, <lb/>
            of pleasure being the first and greatest good, and of atoms <lb/>
            being the origin of the universe, both proceed from the same <lb/>
            source.</p>
          <p>The second attack he made upon him who was cutting into <lb/>
            small pieces the nature of the good, and assigning one portion <lb/>
            to the soul, another to the body, and another to external cir­ <lb/>
            cumstances ; for he wishes the good to be entire, being <lb/>
            assigned to the best thing in us, the intellect alone, as its <lb/>
            inheritance, and not being adapted to anything inanimate.</p>
          <p>XXVII. Nor does he, who is sent forth to search for that <lb/>
            virtue which is invincible and embittered against the ridi­ <lb/>
            culous pursuits of men, by name Tamar, find her. And this <lb/>
            failure of his is strictly in accordance with nature ; for we <lb/>
            read in the scripture, “And Judah sent a kid in the hands of <lb/>
            his shepherd, the Adullamite, to receive back his pledge from <lb/>
            the woman, and he found her not: and he asked the men of <lb/>
            the place, Where is the harlot who was in Ænan by the way­ <lb/>
            side ? and they said, There is no harlot in this place. And he <lb/>
            returned back to Judah, and said unto him, I have not found <lb/>
            her, and the men of the place say that there is no harlot <lb/>
            there. And Judah said, Let her keep the things, only let me <lb/>
            not be made a laughing-stock, I because I have sent the kid, <lb/>
            and you because you have not found her." ‡ Oh, the ad­ <lb/>
            mirable trial ! oh, the temptation becoming sacred things! <lb/>
            Who gave the pledge ? Why the mind, forsooth, which was <lb/>
            eager to purchase the most excellent possession, piety towards <lb/>
            God, by three pledges or symbols, namely a ring, and an <lb/>
            armlet, and a staff, signifying confidence and sure faith ; the <lb/>
            connection and union of reason with life, and of life with <lb/>
            reason; and upright and unchanging instruction on which it is <lb/>
            profitable to rely. Therefore he examines the question as to <lb/>
            whether he had properly given this pledge. What, then, is <note type="footnote"> * Exodus ii. 15. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Exodus ii. 12. </note> <note type="footnote"> ‡ Genesis xxxviii. 20. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="225"/>
            the examination ? to throw down some bait having an at­ <lb/>
            tractive power, such as glory, or riches, or bodily health, or <lb/>
            something similar, and to see to which it will incline, like the <lb/>
            balance in a scale ; for if there is any inclination to any one <lb/>
            of these things the pledge is not sure. Therefore he sent a <lb/>
            kid in order to recover back his pledge from the woman, not <lb/>
            because he had determined by all means to recover it, but <lb/>
            only in the case of her being unworthy to retain it. And <lb/>
            when will this be ? when she willingly exchanges what is of <lb/>
            importance for what is indifferent, preferring spurious to <lb/>
            genuine good.</p>
          <p>Now the genuine good things are faith, the connection and <lb/>
            union of words with deeds, and the rule of right instruction, <lb/>
            as on the other hand the evils are, faithlessness, a want of <lb/>
            such connection between words and deeds, and ignorance. <lb/>
            And spurious goods are those which depend upon appetite <lb/>
            devoid of reason ; for " when he sought her he did not find <lb/>
            her;" for what is good is hard to be found, or, one may even <lb/>
            say, is utterly impossible to be found in a confused life. And <lb/>
            if one inquires whether the soul, which is a harlot, is in every <lb/>
            place of virtue, one will be distinctly told that it is not, and <lb/>
            that it has not been previously; for a common, unchaste, and <lb/>
            wanton, and utterly shameless woman, selling the flower of <lb/>
            her beauty at a low price, and making her external parts both <lb/>
            bright with purifications and washings, but leaving her inward <lb/>
            parts unclean and vile, and being like pictures painted with <lb/>
            colours about the face because of the absence of all natural <lb/>
            beauty; she who pursues that promiscuous evil called the vice <lb/>
            of having many husbands, as if it were a good, coveting <lb/>
            polygamy, and laying herself open for infinite variety, and <lb/>
            being mocked and insulted at the same time by ten thousand <lb/>
            bodies and things, " is not there."</p>
          <p>He, then, who sent the messenger to inquire, hearing this, <lb/>
            having removed envy to a distance from himself, and being <lb/>
            gentle in his nature, rejoices in no moderate degree, and says, <lb/>
            “Perhaps,, then, according to my prayer, she is truly a vir­ <lb/>
            tuous mind, a citizen wife, excelling in modesty, and chastity, <lb/>
            and all other virtues, cleaving to one husband alone, being <lb/>
            content with the administration of one household, and rejoic­ <lb/>
            ing in the authority of one husband ; and if she is such an <lb/>
            one, let her keep what I have given her-the instruction and <note type="footnote"> VOL. II. </note> <note type="footnote"> Q </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="226"/>
            the connection of reason with life and of life with reason, and, <lb/>
            what is the most necessary of all things, surety and faith. <lb/>
            But let us not be laughed at as appearing to have given gifts <lb/>
            which were not merited, while we think that we gave what is <lb/>
            most suitable to the soul; for I, indeed, did what was proper <lb/>
            for a man to do who wished to make experiment of and to <lb/>
            test her disposition, throwing out a bait and sending a mes­ <lb/>
            senger ; but he has showed me that her nature is not easily <lb/>
            caught. And it is not clear to me why it is not easily caught; <lb/>
            for I have seen ten thousand persons of the extremely wicked <lb/>
            class doing the same things as those who are extremely good, <lb/>
            but not with the same purpose, since the one class has truth <lb/>
            and the other only hypocrisy, and it is very hard to distinguish <lb/>
            the one from the other, for very often reality is overpowered <lb/>
            by appearance.</p>
          <p>XXVIII. Also the person who loves virtue seeks a goat by <lb/>
            reason of his sins, but does not find one; for, already, as the <lb/>
            sacred scripture tells us, " it has been burnt.”* Now we <lb/>
            must consider what is intimated under this figurative expres­ <lb/>
            sion—how never to do any thing wrong is the peculiar attri­ <lb/>
            bute of God; and to repent is the part of a wise man. But <lb/>
            this is very difficult and very hard to attain to. Accordingly <lb/>
            the scripture says that Moses sought and sought again" a <lb/>
            reason for repentance for his sins in mortal life; for he was <lb/>
            very anxious to find a soul which was stripped of sill, and <lb/>
            coming forward naked of all offence without shame. But <lb/>
            nevertheless he did not find one, the flame, I mean by this <lb/>
            the very quickly moving irrational desire, rushing inwards and <lb/>
            devouring the whole soul.</p>
          <p>For what is smaller in numbers is usually overpowered <lb/>
            by what is more numerous, and what is slower by what <lb/>
            is more speedy, and what is to come hereafter by what is <lb/>
            present. Now what is contracted in quantity, and slow, and <lb/>
            future, is repentance; what is numerous, and swift, and conti­ <lb/>
            nuous in human life is, iniquity. Very naturally, therefore, <lb/>
            when any one falls into error, he says that he is unable to eat <lb/>
            of what is offered by reason of his sins, so that his conscience <lb/>
            will not permit him to be nourished by repentance; on which <lb/>
            account it is said in the scripture, “Moses heard, and it pleased <lb/>
            him."t For the things which relate to the creature are very <note type="footnote"> * Leviticus x. 16. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Leviticus xvi. 20. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="227"/>
            far removed from the things which relate to God ; for to the <lb/>
            creature only those things which are visible are known, but to <lb/>
            God, even those things also which are invisible. And that <lb/>
            man is crazy who, speaking falsely instead of truly, while <lb/>
            still committing iniquity, asserts that he has repented. It is <lb/>
            like as if one who had a disease were to pretend that he was <lb/>
            in good health; for he, as it seems, will only get more sick, <lb/>
            since he does not choose to apply any of the remedies which <lb/>
            are conducive to health.</p>
          <p>XXIX. On one occasion Moses was urged on, by a desire of <lb/>
            learning, to investigate the causes through which'the most <lb/>
            necessary of the things in the world are brought to perfection; <lb/>
            for seeing how many things come to an end, and are produced <lb/>
            afresh in creation, being again destroyed, and again abiding, <lb/>
            he marvelled, and was amazed, and cried out, saying, " The <lb/>
            bush (<foreign xml:lang="grc">βάτος</foreign>) burns, and is not consumed.”* For he does not <lb/>
            trouble his head about the inaccessible (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἄβατος</foreign>) country as <lb/>
            being the abode of divine natures. But now that he is about to <lb/>
            undertake a labour which will have no success and no end, he <lb/>
            is relieved by the mercy and providence of God, the Saviour <lb/>
            of all men, who has given warning out of his holy shrine, " Do <lb/>
            not approach near this place," which is equivalent to, Do not <lb/>
            approach this consideration ; for it is a business requiring more <lb/>
            labour, and more energy, and care, and fondness for investiga­ <lb/>
            tion than can be suited to human power. But be content with <lb/>
            admiring what is created; and do not be over-curious about <lb/>
            the causes why each thing is created or destroyed.</p>
          <p>" For the place," says God, “on which thou standest is holy <lb/>
            ground."t What kind of place is that? Is it not plain that <lb/>
            it is that which relates to the principles of causes, which is the <lb/>
            only one that he has adapted to the divine natures, not think­ <lb/>
            ing any more competent to aim at a clear understanding of the <lb/>
            principles of causes ? But he who, out of his desire for learn­ <lb/>
            ing, has raised his head above the whole world begins to <lb/>
            inquire concerning the Creator of the world who this being is <lb/>
            who is so difficult to see and whose nature it is so difficult <lb/>
            to conjecture, whether he is a body, or an incorporeal being, or <lb/>
            something above these things, or whether he is a simple <lb/>
            nature like a unit, or a compound being or any ordinary existing <lb/>
            thing. And when he sees how difficult to ascertain, and how <note type="footnote"> * Exodus iii. 2. </note> <note type="footnote"> † Exodus ii. 5. </note> <note type="footnote"> Q 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="228"/>
            difficult to understand this is, he then prays to be allowed to <lb/>
            learn from God himself who God is ; for he has never hoped <lb/>
            to be able to learn this from any other of the beings that are <lb/>
            around him. But nevertheless, though inquiring into the <lb/>
            essence of the living God he has heard nothing. For, says <lb/>
            God, " thou shalt see my back parts, but my face thou shalt <lb/>
            not behold.”* For it is sufficient for the wise man to know <lb/>
            the consequences, and the things which are after God ; but he <lb/>
            who wishes to see the principal essence will be blinded by the <lb/>
            exceeding brilliancy of his rays before he can see it.</p>
          <p>XXX. Having now said thus much concerning the third <lb/>
            head of our subject, we will proceed to the fourth and last of the <lb/>
            propositions we proposed to examine, according to which <lb/>
            discovery sometimes comes to meet us without there having <lb/>
            been any search. To this order belongs every self-taught <lb/>
            and self-instructed wise man ; for such an one has not been <lb/>
            improved by consideration, and care, and labour, but from the <lb/>
            first moment of his birth he has found wisdom ready prepared <lb/>
            and showered upon him from above from heaven, of which he <lb/>
            drinks an unmixed draught and on which he feasts, and con <lb/>
            tinues being intoxicated with a sober intoxication with correct­ <lb/>
            ness of reason. This is the man whom the law calls Isaac, <lb/>
            whom the soul did not conceive at one time and bring forth at <lb/>
            another, for says the scripture, " having conceived him she <lb/>
            brought him forth," t as if without any consideration of time.</p>
          <p>For it was not a man who was now being thus brought <lb/>
            forth, but a conception of the purest character, beautiful rather <lb/>
            in its nature than in consequence of any study ; for which <lb/>
            reason also she who brings him forth is said to have given up <lb/>
            the usual manner of women, that is to say her usual, and <lb/>
            reasonable, and human customs. For the self-taught race is <lb/>
            something new, and beyond any description, and truly divine, <lb/>
            existing not by any human conceptions, but by some inspired <lb/>
            frenzy. Are you ignorant that the Hebrews stand in no <lb/>
            need of midwives for their delivery? But they, as Moses says, <lb/>
            “bring forth before the midwives can arrive," by which is <lb/>
            meant that they have nature alone for a coadjutor, without <lb/>
            having any need of methods, or arts, or sciences.</p>
          <p>And Moses gives very beautiful and very natural definitions <lb/>
            of what is taught a man by himself: one being such a thing <note type="footnote"> * Exodus xxxiii. 23. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Genesis xxi. 2. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="229"/>
            as is speedily discovered, the other what God himself, has <lb/>
            given us ; accordingly, that which is taught by others requires <lb/>
            a long time, but what is taught a man by himself is quick, <lb/>
            and in a manner independent of time. And the one again has <lb/>
            God for its expounder, but the other has man. Now the first <lb/>
            definition he has placed in the question, " What is this that <lb/>
            thou has found so quickly, 0 my son?”* But the other is <lb/>
            contained in the answer to this question, “What the Lord God <lb/>
            gave unto me."</p>
          <p>XXXI. There is also a third definition of what is taught a <lb/>
            man by himself, namely that which of its own accord rises <lb/>
            upwards. For it is said in the hortatory injunctions, “ Ye <lb/>
            shall not sow, neither shall ye reap those things which arise <lb/>
            from the earth of their own accord." t</p>
          <p>For nature has no need of any art since God himself sows those <lb/>
            things, and by his agricultural skill brings to perfection, as if <lb/>
            they grew of themselves, things which do not grow of themselves, <lb/>
            except inasmuch as they stand in need of no human assistance <lb/>
            whatever. But this is not so much a positive exhortation as <lb/>
            an announcement of his opinion, for if he had been giving a <lb/>
            positive recommendation he would have said, "Do not sow, and <lb/>
            do not reap:" but as he is only giving his opinion, he says, <lb/>
            " Ye shall not sow, neither shall ye reap." For as to those <lb/>
            things with which we meet by the voluntary bounty of nature, <lb/>
            of these we cannot find either the beginnings or the ends in <lb/>
            ourselves as if we were the causes of them : therefore the <lb/>
            beginning is the seed-time and the end the harvest time. And <lb/>
            it is better to understand these things thus: every beginning <lb/>
            and every end is spontaneous, that is to say, it is the work <lb/>
            of nature and not of ourselves. For instance; what is the <lb/>
            beginning of learning. It is plain that it is a nature in the <lb/>
            person who is taught which is well calculated to receive the <lb/>
            particular subjects of meditation submitted to him. Again <lb/>
            what is the beginning of being made perfect ? If we are to <lb/>
            speak plainly without keeping anything back, it is nature. <lb/>
            Therefore he who teaches is also indeed to effect improvement, <lb/>
            but it is God alone, the most excellent nature of all, who is <lb/>
            able to conduct one to supreme perfection.</p>
          <p>He who is bred up among such doctrines as these has ever­ <lb/>
            lasting peace, and is released from wearisome and endless <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xxvii. 20. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Genesis xxv. 11 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="230"/>
            labours. And according to the lawgiver there is no difference <lb/>
            between peace and a week; for in each creation lays aside the <lb/>
            appearance of energising and rests. Very properly, therefore, <lb/>
            si it said, " And the sabbath of the law shall be food for you," <lb/>
            speaking figuratively. For the only thing which is really <lb/>
            nourishing and really enjoyable is rest in God ; which confers <lb/>
            the greatest good, undisturbed peace. Peace, therefore, among <lb/>
            cities is mixed up with civil war; but the peace of the soul has <lb/>
            no mixture in it of any kind of difference.</p>
          <p>And the lawgiver appears to me to be recommending most <lb/>
            manifestly that kind of discovery which is not preceded by any <lb/>
            search, in the following words, “ When the Lord thy God shall <lb/>
            lead thee into the land which he swore to thy fathers that he <lb/>
            would give to thee, large and beautiful cities which thou <lb/>
            buildedst not, houses full of all good things which thou filledst <lb/>
            not, cisterns hewn out of the quarries which thou hewedst not, <lb/>
            vineyards and olive gardens which thou plantedst not."* You <lb/>
            see here the ungrudging abundance of all the great blessings <lb/>
            which are ready, and poured forth for man's possession and <lb/>
            enjoyment. And the generic virtues are here likened to <lb/>
            cities, because they are of the most comprehensive kind; and <lb/>
            the specific virtues are likened to houses, because they are <lb/>
            contracted into a narrower circle; and the souls of a good <lb/>
            disposition are likened to cisterns, which are well inclined to <lb/>
            receive wisdom, as the cisterns are calculated to receive water ; <lb/>
            and the improvement, and growth, and production of fruit, are <lb/>
            compared to vineyards and olive gardens; and the fruit of <lb/>
            knowledge is a life of contemplation, which produces unmixed <lb/>
            joy, equal to that which proceeds from wine, and a light <lb/>
            appreciable only by the intellect, as if from a flame of which <lb/>
            oil is the nourishment.</p>
          <p>XXXII. Having now said thus much on the subject of <lb/>
            discovery, we will proceed in due order to what comes next in <lb/>
            the context. Moses proceeds, " Therefore the angel of the <lb/>
            Lord found her sitting by a fountain of water." Now a foun­ <lb/>
            tain is spoken of in many senses ; in one manner our mind is <lb/>
            meant by a fountain, in another the rational habit and <lb/>
            instruction; in a third sense a bad disposition is intitimated ; <lb/>
            in a fourth sense a good disposition, the contrary of the pre­ <lb/>
            ceding ; in a fifth sense, the Creator and Father of the <lb/>
            universe is himself thus spoken of in a figure; and there are <note type="footnote"> * Deuteronomy vi. 10. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="231"/>
            passages written in the sacred scriptures which give proofs of <lb/>
            these things. What they are we must now consider. Now in <lb/>
            the very beginning of the history of the law there is a passage <lb/>
            to the following effect: " And a fountain went up from the <lb/>
            earth, and watered all the face of the eartb.”* Those men. <lb/>
            then, who are not initiated in allegory and in the nature which <lb/>
            loves to hide itself, liken the fountain here mentioned to the <lb/>
            river of Egypt, which every year overflows and makes all the <lb/>
            adjacent plains a lake, almost appearing to exhibit a power imi­ <lb/>
            tating and equal to that of heaven; for what the heaven during <lb/>
            winter bestows on other countries, the Nile affords to Egypt at <lb/>
            the height of summer; for the heaven sends rain from above <lb/>
            upon the earth, but the river, raining upward from below, which <lb/>
            seems a most paradoxical statement, irrigates the corn-fields.</p>
          <p>And it is starting from this point that Moses has described <lb/>
            the Egyptian disposition as an atheistical one, because it values <lb/>
            the earth above the heaven, and the things of the earth above <lb/>
            the things of heaven, and the body above the soul; but, how­ <lb/>
            ever, we shall have an opportunity of speaking on these sub­ <lb/>
            jects hereafter when occasion permits.</p>
          <p>But at present, for we must study not to be too prolix, we <lb/>
            had better have recourse to an explanation which may be <lb/>
            drawn from looking on the words as used figuratively ; and we <lb/>
            may say that the meaning of the statement that “ a fountain <lb/>
            went up and watered all the face of the earth," is something <lb/>
            of this kind. The dominant part of us, like a fountain, pours <lb/>
            forth many powers through the veins of the earth as it were, <lb/>
            till they reach the organs of the external senses, that is to say, <lb/>
            the eyes, and ears, and nostrils, and other organs; and these <lb/>
            organs in every animal are situated about the head and face. <lb/>
            Therefore, the face, which is the dominant portion of the body, <lb/>
            is irrigated as from a fountain from the dominant portion of <lb/>
            the soul; making the spirit, which is calculated for seeing. <lb/>
            reach to the eyes, that which has the power of hearing reach <lb/>
            the ears, the spirit of smelling reach the nostrils, that of taste <lb/>
            the mouth, and causing that of touch to pervade the whole <lb/>
            surface of the body.</p>
          <p>XXXIII. There are also many various fountains of instruc­ <lb/>
            tion, by means of which most nutritious reasonings have <lb/>
            sprung up like the trunks of palm-trees; " for," says Moses, <note type="footnote"> * Genesis ii. 6. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="232"/>
            " they came to Aileim, and in Aileim there were twelve foun­ <lb/>
            tains of water and seventy trunks of palm-trees. And they <lb/>
            pitched their tents there by the side of the water."* The <lb/>
            name Aileim is interpreted to mean " vestibules," a symbol of <lb/>
            the approach to virtue. For as vestibules are the beginning <lb/>
            of a house, so also are the encyclical preliminary branches of <lb/>
            instruction the beginning of virtue, and twelve is the perfect <lb/>
            number, of which the circle of the zodiac in the heaven is a <lb/>
            witness, studded as it is with such numbers of brilliant con­ <lb/>
            stellations. The periodical revolution of the sun is another <lb/>
            witness, for he accomplishes his circle in twelve months, and <lb/>
            men also reckon the hours of the day and of the night as equal <lb/>
            in number to the months of the year, and the passages are not <lb/>
            few in which Moses celebrates this number, describing the <lb/>
            twelve tribes of his nation, appointing by law the offering of <lb/>
            the twelve cakes of shew'bread, and ordering twelve stones, on <lb/>
            which inscriptions are engraved, to be woven into the sacred <lb/>
            robe of the garment, reaching down to the feet of the high­ <lb/>
            priest, on liis oracular dress.</p>
          <p>He also celebrates the number seven, multiplied by the <lb/>
            number ten; at one time speaking of the seventy palm-trees <lb/>
            by the fountains, and in other passages he speaks of the <lb/>
            elders, who were only seventy in number, to whom the divine <lb/>
            and prophetical Spirit was vouchsafed. And again, it is the <lb/>
            same number of heifers which are sacrificed at the solemn fes­ <lb/>
            tival of the feast of tabernacles,t in a regular and proper <lb/>
            division and order, for they are not all sacrificed together, but <lb/>
            in seven days, the beginning being made with thirteen bulls; <lb/>
            for thus, by every day subtracting one till they come to the <lb/>
            number seven, the arranged number of seventy is properly <lb/>
            -completed.</p>
          <p>And when they have come to the gates of virtue, the pre­ <lb/>
            liminary liberal sciences, and have seen the fountains, and the <lb/>
            stems of the palm-trees growing by them, they are said to <lb/>
            pitch their tents, not by the palm-trees, but by the waters. <lb/>
            Why is this ? Because those who carry off the prizes of per­ <lb/>
            fect virtue are adorned with palm-leaves and with fillets; but <lb/>
            those who are still exercising themselves in the preliminary <lb/>
            branches of instruction, as people thirsting for learning, settle <note type="footnote"> * Exodus xv. 27. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Numbers xxix. 13. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="233"/>
            themselves by the side of those sciences which are able to <lb/>
            bedew and irrigate their souls.</p>
          <p>XXXIV. Such then are the fountains of intermediate in­ <lb/>
            struction. Let us now consider the fountain of folly, concerning <lb/>
            which the lawgiver speaks thus, " Whosoever shall lie with a <lb/>
            woman who is sitting apart has uncovered her fountain, and <lb/>
            she has uncovered the issue of her blood; they shall both be <lb/>
            destroyed."* He here calls the external sense a woman, re­ <lb/>
            presenting the mind as her husband. When therefore the <lb/>
            woman, having forsaken her legitimate husband, settles near <lb/>
            those objects of the external sense which allures and destroys, <lb/>
            and embraces them all in an amorous manner; then there­ <lb/>
            fore, if the mind be turned to sleep when it is necessary that <lb/>
            it should be awakened, it has uncovered the fountain of the <lb/>
            external sense, that is itself, that is to say, it has rendered <lb/>
            itself, without a covering and without a wall, and easy to be <lb/>
            plotted against. But nevertheless the woman also has un­ <lb/>
            covered the fountain of her blood, for every external sense, <lb/>
            when flowing towards the external object appreciable by it, is <lb/>
            cheered and restrained by being under the dominion of the <lb/>
            reason ; and it is left in a solitary condition, being deprived of <lb/>
            any proper governor. And as the most terrible misfortune for <lb/>
            a city is to be without walls, so the most unfortunate state for <lb/>
            a soul is to be without a guardian.</p>
          <p>When, then, is it without a guardian ? Is it not when the <lb/>
            sight is without any covering, being poured forth upon the <lb/>
            objects of sight; and when the hearing is without a covering, <lb/>
            being occupied in drinking in all kinds of sounds ; and when <lb/>
            the sense of smell is uncovered, and the kindred powers are <lb/>
            left to themselves, and so are most ready to suffer whatever <lb/>
            the invading enemy may be disposed to inflict? And that <lb/>
            speech is uncovered and uttered which speaks ten thousand <lb/>
            things in an unseasonable manner, without any thing to <lb/>
            restrain its impetuosity; therefore flowing on unrestrainedly, <lb/>
            it overturns many noble purposes and plans of life which were <lb/>
            previously sailing on erect as though in calm weather.</p>
          <p>This is that great deluge in which " the cataracts of heaven <lb/>
            were opened ”†—by heaven I here mean of the mind-and <lb/>
            the fountains of the bottomless pit were revealed ; that is to <lb/>
            say, of the outward sense; for in this way alone is the soul <note type="footnote"> * Leviticus xx. 18. </note> <note type="footnote"> † Genesis vii. 11. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="234"/>
            overwhelmed, iniquities being broken up and poured over it <lb/>
            from above, as from the heaven of the mind, and the passions <lb/>
            irrigating it from below, as from the earth of the outward <lb/>
            senses. For which reason Moses forbids a man to uncover <lb/>
            the nakedness of his father or his mother,* well knowing how <lb/>
            great an evil it is not to check and to conceal the offences of the <lb/>
            mind and of the external sense, but to bring them forward and <lb/>
            display them as though they were good actions.</p>
          <p>XXXV. These are the fountains of errors. We must now <lb/>
            examine that of prudence. To this one it is that perseverance, <lb/>
            that is to say, Rebecca, descends ;† and after she has filled up <lb/>
            the whole vessel of her soul she goes up again, the lawgiver, <lb/>
            most strictly in accordance with natural truth, calling her <lb/>
            return an ascent; for whoever brings his mind to descend <lb/>
            from over-arrogant haughtiness is raised to a great height of <lb/>
            virtue. For Moses says, " And having gone down to the <lb/>
            fountain, she filled her ewer, and went up again." This is <lb/>
            that divine wisdom from which all the particular sciences are <lb/>
            irrigated, and all the souls which love contemplation and are <lb/>
            filled with a love of what is most excellent; and to this <lb/>
            fountain the sacred scripture most appropriately assigns a <lb/>
            name, calling it "judgment" and "holy." For says the <lb/>
            historian, " Having turned back, they came to the fountain of <lb/>
            judgment; this is the fountain of Caddes,”‡ and the interpre­ <lb/>
            tation of the name Caddes is holy. It all but cries out and <lb/>
            shouts that the wisdom of God is holy, bringing with it nothing <lb/>
            of the earth, and that it is the judgment of the universe by <lb/>
            which all contrarieties are separated from one another.</p>
          <p>XXXVI. We must now speak also concerning that highest <lb/>
            and most excellent of fountains which the Father of the <lb/>
            universe spake of by the mouths of the prophets; for he has <lb/>
            said somewhere, " They have left me, the fountain of life, and <lb/>
            they have digged for themselves cisterns already worn out, <lb/>
            which will not be able to hold water ;"§ therefore God is the <lb/>
            most ancient of all fountains. And is not this very natural ? <lb/>
            For he it is who has irrigated the whole of this world; and I <lb/>
            am amazed when I hear that this is the fountain of life, for <lb/>
            God alone is the cause of animation and life, and most <lb/>
            especially of rational animation and of that life which is in <note type="footnote"> * Leviticus xviii. 7. </note><note type="footnote"> ‡ Genesis xiv. 7. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Genesis xxiv. 15. </note><note type="footnote"> § Jeremiah ii. 13. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="235"/>
            union with prudence; for the matter is dead. But God is <lb/>
            something more than life; he is, as he himself has said, the <lb/>
            everlasting fountain of living.</p>
          <p>But the wicked having fled away, and having passed their <lb/>
            time without ever tasting the draught of immortality, have <lb/>
            digged, insane persons that they are, for themselves, and not <lb/>
            first for God, having preferred their own actions to the <lb/>
            heavenly and celestial things, and the things which proceed <lb/>
            from care to those which are spontaneous and ready. Then <lb/>
            they dig, not as the wise men Abraham and Isaac did, making <lb/>
            wells, but cisterns, which have no good nutritious stream <lb/>
            belonging to and proceeding from themselves, but requiring an <lb/>
            influx from without, which must proceed from instruction. <lb/>
            While the teachers are always pouring into the ears of their <lb/>
            disciples all kinds of doctrines and speculations of science <lb/>
            altogether, admonishing them to retain them in their minds, <lb/>
            and to preserve them when faithfully committed to memory.</p>
          <p>But now they are but worn-out cisterns, that is to say, all <lb/>
            the channels of the ill-educated soul are broken and leaky, not <lb/>
            being able to hold and to preserve the influx of those streams <lb/>
            which are able to profit.</p>
          <p>XXXVII. We have now then said as much as the time will <lb/>
            permit us to say on the subject of the fountains, and it is <lb/>
            with great accuracy and propriety that the sacred scriptures <lb/>
            represent Hagar as found at the fountain, and not as drawing <lb/>
            water from it: for the soul has not as yet made such an <lb/>
            advance as to be fit to use the unmixed draught of wisdom; <lb/>
            but it is not forbidden from making its abode in its neighbour­ <lb/>
            hood. And all the road which is made by instruction is easy <lb/>
            to travel, and most safe, and most solid, and strong, on which <lb/>
            account the scripture tells us that she was found in the road <lb/>
            leading to Shur; and the name Shur being interpreted means <lb/>
            a wall or a direction. Therefore its convicter, speaking to the <lb/>
            soul, says, “ Whence comest thou, and whither goest thou?" <lb/>
            And it says, not because it doubts, and not so much by way of <lb/>
            asking a question, as in a downcast and reproachful spirit, for <lb/>
            an angel cannot be ignorant of anything that concerns us, and <lb/>
            a proof of this is, that he is well acquainted even with the <lb/>
            things which are in the womb, and which are invisible to the <lb/>
            creature, inasmuch as he says, " Behold thou art with child, <lb/>
            and thou shalt bring forth a son, and shalt call his name <lb/>
             <pb n="236"/>
            Ishmael ;” for to know that that which is conceived is a male <lb/>
            child does not belong to human power, any more than it does to <lb/>
            foretell the description of life which the child who is not yet <lb/>
            born will adopt, namely, that it will be rude life, and not that <lb/>
            of a citizen or of a polished man.</p>
          <p>The expression, '' Whence comest thou?'' is said by way of <lb/>
            reproving the soul, which is fleeing from the better and domi­ <lb/>
            nant opinion, of which she is the handmaiden, not in name <lb/>
            more than in fact, and by remaining in subjection to which <lb/>
            she would gain great glory. And the expression, " And whither <lb/>
            goest thou ?" means, you are running after uncertain things, <lb/>
            having discarded and thrown away confessed good. It <lb/>
            is well, therefore, to praise her for rejoicing at this admo­ <lb/>
            nition. And she shows a proof of her delighting in it, by not <lb/>
            bringing any accusation against her mistress, and by attribut­ <lb/>
            ing the cause of her running away to her own self, and by <lb/>
            her making no reply to the second question, " Whither goest <lb/>
            thou?" for it is a matter of uncertainty ; and it is both safe and <lb/>
            necessary to restrain one's self from speaking of what is uncer­ <lb/>
            tai n.</p>
          <p>XXXVIII. Therefore the convicter of the soul approving of <lb/>
            her in respect of her obedience says, Return unto thy mistress; <lb/>
            for the government of the teacher is profitable to the disciple, <lb/>
            and servitude in subjection to wisdom is advantageous to her <lb/>
            who is imperfect; and when thou return est, " be thou humbled <lb/>
            under her hands:” —a very beautiful humiliation, compre­ <lb/>
            hending the destruction of irrational pride. For thus, after a <lb/>
            gentle travail, thou wilt bring forth a male child, by name <lb/>
            Ishmael, corrected by divine admonitions ; for Ishmael, being <lb/>
            interpreted, means " the hearing of God ;" and hearing is <lb/>
            considered as entitled to only the second prize after seeing; <lb/>
            but seeing is the inheritance of the legitimate and first-born <lb/>
            son, Israel; for the name Israel, being interpreted, means <lb/>
            " seeing God."</p>
          <p>For it is possible for a man to hear false statements as <lb/>
            though they were true, because hearing is a deceitful thing; <lb/>
            but seeing is a sense which cannot be deceived, by which a <lb/>
            man perceives existing things as they really are. But the <lb/>
            angel describes the characteristics of the disposition which is <lb/>
            born of Hagar, by saying that he will be a rude man ; as if <lb/>
            he had said that he would be a man wise about rude matters, <lb/>
             <pb n="237"/>
            and not as yet thought worthy of that which is the truly divine <lb/>
            and political portion of life: and this is virtue, by means of <lb/>
            which it is the nature of the moral character to be humanised. <lb/>
            And by his saying, “His hand shall be against every man, and <lb/>
            every man's hand against him," he means to describe the design <lb/>
            and plan of life of a sophist, who professes an over-curious <lb/>
            scepticism, and who rejoices in disputatious arguments.</p>
          <p>Such a man shoots at all the followers of learning, and in <lb/>
            his own person opposes all men, both publicly and privately, <lb/>
            and is shot at by all who very naturally repel him as if they <lb/>
            were acting in defence of their own offspring, that is to say, <lb/>
            of the doctrines which their soul has brought forth.</p>
          <p>He also adds a third characteristic of him, saying, " He shall <lb/>
            dwell before the face of all his brethren." In these words all <lb/>
            but expressly declaring that he will wage an everlasting battle <lb/>
            and war against them, face to face, for ever. Therefore the <lb/>
            soul, which is pregnant with sophistical reasoning, says to the <lb/>
            convicter who is addressing her, " Thou art God, who hast be­ <lb/>
            held mean expression equivalent to, Thou art the creator <lb/>
            of my plans and of my offspring. And may we not look upon <lb/>
            this as a very natural reply on her part ? For of these souls <lb/>
            which are free, and, as it were truly citizens, the Creator is <lb/>
            free, and a deliverer; but of slavish minds, slaves are the <lb/>
            creators.</p>
          <p>And the angels are the servants of God, and are considered <lb/>
            actual gods by those who are in toil and slavery ; on this ac­ <lb/>
            count, says Moses, she called the well, " The well where I saw <lb/>
            in front of me." But 0, thou soul! advancing in wisdom and <lb/>
            plunging deep into the knowledge of the elementary parts of <lb/>
            encyclical instruction, thou wast not able to see the cause of <lb/>
            thy knowledge in instruction as in a mirror. But the most <lb/>
            appropriate place for such a well is in the midst, between <lb/>
            Caddes and Barad; and the name Barad, being interpreted, <unclear/> <lb/>
            means "in common," and Caddes means " holy for the <lb/>
            person who is in a state of imprisonment is on the confines <lb/>
            between what is holy and what is profane, fleeing from what is <lb/>
            wicked, and being not yet able to live in the company of what <lb/>
            is perfectly good.</p><pb n="238"/>

          </head>
          <p>I. " ABRAHAM was ninety and nine years old ; and the Lord <lb/>
            appeared unto Abraham, and said unto him, I am thy God."* <lb/>
            The number of nine, when added to the number ninety, is <lb/>
            very near to a hundred ; in which number the self-taught race <lb/>
            shone forth, namely Isaac, the most excellent joy of all enjoy­ <lb/>
            ments ; for he was born when his father was a hundred years <lb/>
            old. Moreover the first fruits of the tribe of Levi are given <lb/>
            up to the priests ;t for they having taken tithes, offer up other <lb/>
            tenths from them as from their own fruits, which thus com­ <lb/>
            prise the number of a hundred; for the number ten is the <lb/>
            symbol of improvement, and the number a hundred is the <lb/>
            symbol of perfection; and he that is in the middle is always <lb/>
            striving to reach the extremity, exerting the inborn goodness <lb/>
            of his nature, by which he says, that the Lord of the universe <lb/>
            has appeared to him.</p>
          <p>But do not thou think that this appearance presented itself <lb/>
            to the eyes of the body, for they see no things but such as are <lb/>
            perceptible to the outward senses; but those objects of the <lb/>
            outward senses are compound ones, full of destruction; but <lb/>
            the Deity is not a compound object, and is indestructible: but <lb/>
            the eye which receives the impression of the divine appear­ <lb/>
            alice is the eye of the soul; for besides this, those things <lb/>
            which it is only the eyes of the body that see, are only seen by <lb/>
            them because they take light as a coadjutor, and light is <lb/>
            different, both from the object seen and from the things which <lb/>
            see it.</p>
          <p>But all these things which the soul sees of itself, and <lb/>
            through its own power, it sees without the co-operation of any <lb/>
            thing or any one else ; for the things which the soul does thus <lb/>
            comprehend are a light to themselves, and in the same way <lb/>
            also we learn the sciences; for the mind, applying its never- <lb/>
            closing and never-slumbering eye to their doctrines and specu­ <lb/>
            lations, sees them by no spurious light, but by that genuine <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xvn. 1. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Numbers xviii. 26. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="239"/>
            light which shines forth from itself. When therefore you <lb/>
            hear that God has been seen by man, you must consider that <lb/>
            this is said without any reference to that light which is per­ <lb/>
            ceptible by the external senses, for it is natural that that <lb/>
            which is appreciable only by the intellect should be presented <lb/>
            to the intellect alone ; and the fountain of the purest light is <lb/>
            God; so that when God appears to the soul he pours forth <lb/>
            his beams without any shade, and beaming with the most <lb/>
            radiant brilliancy.</p>
          <p>II. Do not, however, think that the living God, he who is <lb/>
            truly living, is ever seen so as to be comprehended by any <lb/>
            human being; for we have no power in ourselves to see any <lb/>
            thing, by which we may be able to conceive any adequate <lb/>
            notion of him; we have no external sense suited to that pur­ <lb/>
            pose (for he is not an object which can be discerned by the <lb/>
            outward sense), nor any strength adequate to it; therefore, <lb/>
            Moses, the spectator of the invisible nature, the mail who really <lb/>
            saw God (for the sacred scriptures say that he entered " into <lb/>
            the darkness,”* by which expression they mean figuratively to <lb/>
            intimate the invisible essence), having investigated every part <lb/>
            of every thing, sought to see clearly the much-desired and only <lb/>
            God; but when he found nothing, not even any appearance at <lb/>
            all resembling what he had hoped to behold; he, then, giving <lb/>
            up all idea of receiving instruction on that point from any <lb/>
            other source, flies to the very being himself whom he was <lb/>
            seeking, and entreats him, saving, “ Show me thyself that I <lb/>
            may see thee so as to know thee."t</p>
          <p>But, nevertheless, he fails to obtain the end which he had <lb/>
            proposed to himself, and which he had accounted the most all- <lb/>
            sufficient gift for the most excellent race of creation, mankind, <lb/>
            namely a knowledge of those bodies and things which are <lb/>
            below the living God. For it is said unto him, " Thou shalt <lb/>
            see my back parts, but my face shall not be beheld by thee.”‡ <lb/>
            As if it were meant to answer him: Those bodies and things <lb/>
            which are beneath the living God may come within thy com­ <lb/>
            prehension, even though every thing would not be at once <lb/>
            comprehended by thee, since that one being is not by his <lb/>
            nature capable of being beheld by man. And what wonder is <lb/>
            there if the living God is beyond the reach of the comprehen­ <lb/>
            sion of man, when even the mind that is in each of us is <note type="footnote"> * Exodus xx. 21. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Exodus xxxiii. 13. </note> <note type="footnote"> ‡ Exodus xxxiii. 23. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="240"/>
            unintelligible and unknown to us ? Who has ever beheld the <lb/>
            essence of the soul ? the obscure nature of which has given <lb/>
            rise to an infinite number of contests among the sophists who <lb/>
            have brought forward opposite opinions, some of which are <lb/>
            inconsistent with any kind of nature.</p>
          <p>It was, therefore, quite consistent with reason that no <lb/>
            proper name could with propriety be assigned to him who is <lb/>
            in truth the living God. Do you not see that to the prophet <lb/>
            who is really desirous of making an honest inquiry after the <lb/>
            truth, and who asks what answer he is to give to those who <lb/>
            question him as to the name of him who has sent him, he <lb/>
            says, "I am that I am,"* which is equivalent to saying, " It <lb/>
            is my nature to be, Dot to be described by name but in <lb/>
            order that the human race may not be wholly destitute of any <lb/>
            appellation which they may give to the most excellent of <lb/>
            beings, 1 allow you to use the word Lord as a name; the Lord <lb/>
            God of three natures-of instruction, and of holiness, and of <lb/>
            the practice of virtue; of which Abraham, and Isaac, and <lb/>
            Jacob are recorded as the symbols. For this, says he, is the <lb/>
            everlasting name, as if it had been investigated and discerned <lb/>
            in time as it exists in reference to us, and not in that time <lb/>
            which was before all time ; and it is also a memorial not <lb/>
            placed beyond recollection or intelligence, and again it is <lb/>
            addressed to persons who have been born, not to uncreated <lb/>
            natures.</p>
          <p>For these men have need of the complete use of the divine <lb/>
            name who come to a created or mortal generation, in order <lb/>
            that, if they cannot attain to the best thing, they may at least <lb/>
            arrive at the best possible name, and arrange themselves in <lb/>
            accordance with that; and the sacred oracle which is delivered <lb/>
            as from the mouth of the Ruler of the universe, speaks of the <lb/>
            proper name of God never having been revealed to any one, <lb/>
            when God is represented as saying, " For I have not she vn <lb/>
            them my name;”† for by a slight change in the figure of <lb/>
            speech here used, the meaning of what is said would be some­ <lb/>
            thing of this kind : " My proper name I have not revealed to <lb/>
            them," but only that which is commonly used, though with <lb/>
            some misapplication, because of the reasons above-mentioned.</p>
          <p>And, indeed, the living God is so completely indescribable, <lb/>
            that even those powers which minister unto him do not <note type="footnote"> * Exodus iii. 14. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Exodus vi. 3. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="241"/>
            announce his proper name to us. At all events, after the <lb/>
            wrestling match in which the practiser of virtue wrestled for <lb/>
            the sake of the acquisition of virtue, he says to the invisible <lb/>
            Master, "Tell me thy name;”* but he said, "Why askest <lb/>
            thou me my name ?" And he does not tell him his peculiar <lb/>
            and proper name, for says he, it is sufficient for thee to be <lb/>
            taught my ordinary explanations. But as for names which <lb/>
            are the symbols of created things, do not seek to find them <lb/>
            among immortal natures.</p>
          <p>III. Therefore do not doubt either whether that which is <lb/>
            more ancient than any existing thing is indescribable, when <lb/>
            his very word is not to be mentioned by us according to its <lb/>
            proper name. So that we must understand that the expression, <lb/>
            " The Lord was seen by Abraham,”† means not as if the <lb/>
            Cause of all things had shone forth and become visible, (for <lb/>
            what human mind is able to contain the greatness of his <lb/>
            appearance ?) but as if some one of the powers which surround <lb/>
            him, that is to say, his kingly power, had presented itself to <lb/>
            the sight, for the appellation Lord belongs to authority and <lb/>
            sovereignty.</p>
          <p>But when our mind was occupied with the wisdom of the <lb/>
            Chaldæans, studying the sublime things which exist in the <lb/>
            world, it made as it were the circuit of all the efficient powers <lb/>
            as causes of what existed; but when it emigrated from the <lb/>
            Chaldæan doctrines, it then knew that it was moving under <lb/>
            the guidance and direction of a governor, of whose authority it <lb/>
            perceived the appearance. On which account it is said, "The <lb/>
            Lord," not the living God, " was seen ;” as if it had been <lb/>
            meant to say, the king appeared, he who was from the begin­ <lb/>
            ning, but who was .not as yet recognized by the soul, which, <lb/>
            indeed, was late in learning, but which did not continue for <lb/>
            ever in ignorance, but received a notion of there being an <lb/>
            authority and governing power among existing things.</p>
          <p>And when the ruler has appeared, then he in a still greater <lb/>
            degree benefits his disciple and beholder, saying, " I am thy <lb/>
            God;”‡ for I should say to him, "What is there of all the <lb/>
            things which form a part of creation of which thou art not the <lb/>
            God?" But his word, which is his interpreter, will teach me <lb/>
            that he is not at present speaking of the world, of which he is <lb/>
            by all means the creator and the God, but about the souls of <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xxxii. 29. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Genesis xvii. 1. </note> <note type="footnote"> ‡ Genesis xvii. 2. </note> <note type="footnote"> VOL. II. </note> <note type="footnote"> R </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="242"/>
            men, which he has thought worthy of a different kind of care ; <lb/>
            for he thinks fit to be called the Lord and Master of bad <lb/>
            men, but the God of those who are in a state of advancement <lb/>
            and improvement; and of those which are the most excellent <lb/>
            and the most perfect, both Lord and God at once. On which <lb/>
            account, having made Pharaoh the very extreme instance of <lb/>
            impiety, he has never once called himself his Lord or his God ; <lb/>
            but he calls the wise Moses so, for he says to him, " Behold I <lb/>
            give thee as a god to Pharaoh.”* But he has in many passages <lb/>
            of the sacred oracles delivered by him, called himself Lord. <lb/>
            For instance, we read such a passage as this: " Thus says the <lb/>
            Lord ;"t and at the very beginning we read, " The Lord spake <lb/>
            unto Moses, saying, I am the Lord, say unto Pharaoh, the <lb/>
            king of Egypt, all the things which I say unto thee.”‡ And <lb/>
            Moses, in another place, says, " Behold, when I go forth out of <lb/>
            the city I will spread out my hands unto the Lord, and the <lb/>
            sounds shall cease, and the hail, and there shall be no more <lb/>
            rain, that thou mayest know that the earth is the Lord's <lb/>
            that is to say, every thing that is made of body or of earth, <lb/>
            “and that thou," that is the mind which bears in itself the <lb/>
            images of things, " and thy servants," that is the particular <lb/>
            reasonings which act as body-guards to the mind, " for I know <lb/>
            that ye do not yet fear the Lord ;"§ by which he means not <lb/>
            the Lord who is spoken of commonly and in different senses, <lb/>
            but him who is truly the Master of all things.</p>
          <p>For there is in truth no created Lord, not even if a king <lb/>
            shall have extended his authority and spread it from one end <lb/>
            of the world even to the other end, but only the uncreated <lb/>
            God, the real governor, whose authority he who reverences and <lb/>
            fears receives a most beneficial reward, namely, the admo­ <lb/>
            nitions 'of God, but utterly miserable destruction awaits the <lb/>
            man who despises him; therefore he is held forth as the Lord <lb/>
            of the foolish, striking them with a terror which is appropriate <lb/>
            to him as ruler. But he is the God of those who are im­ <lb/>
            proved ; as we read now, " I am thy God, I am thy God, be <lb/>
            thou increased and multiplied.”|| And in the case of those <lb/>
            who are perfect, he is both together, both Lord and God; as <lb/>
            we read in the ten commandments, " I am the Lord thy <note type="footnote"> * Genesis vii. 1. </note><note type="footnote"> ‡ Exodus vi. 29. </note><note type="footnote"> II Genesis xvii. 1, also xxxv. 2. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Exodus vii. 17. </note><note type="footnote"> § Exodus ix. 29. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="243"/>
            God."* And in another passage it is written, “ The Lord <lb/>
            God of our fathers.”†</p>
          <p>For he thinks it right for the wicked man to be governed by a <lb/>
            master as by a lord ; that, being in a state of alarm and groan­ <lb/>
            ing, he may have the fear of a master suspended over him ; but <lb/>
            him who is advancing in improvement lie thinks deserving to <lb/>
            receive benefits as from God in order that by means of these <lb/>
            benefits he may arrive at perfection ; and him who is complete <lb/>
            and perfect he thinks should be both governed as by the Lord, <lb/>
            and benefited as by God ; for the last man remains for ever un­ <lb/>
            changeable, and he is, by all means and In all respects, the man <lb/>
            of God: and this is especially shown to be the fact in the case <lb/>
            of Moses; for, says the scripture, " This is the blessing which <lb/>
            Moses, the man of God, blessed.”‡ 0 the man thus thought <lb/>
            worthy of this all-beautiful and sacred recompense, to give <lb/>
            himself as a requital for the divine Providence ! But do not <lb/>
            thou think that he is in the same sense a man and the man <lb/>
            of God; for he is said to be a man as being a possession of <lb/>
            God, but the man of God as boasting in and being benefited <lb/>
            by him. And if thou wishest to have God as the inheritance <lb/>
            of thy mind, then do thou in the first place labour to become <lb/>
            yourself an inheritance worthy of him, and thou wilt be such <lb/>
            if thou avoidest all laws made by hands and voluntary.</p>
          <p>IV. But it is not right to be ignorant of this thing either, <lb/>
            that the statement, " I am thy God,”§ is made by a certain <lb/>
            figurative misuse of language rather than with strict propriety; <lb/>
            for the living God, inasmuch as he is living, does not consist <lb/>
            in relation to anything; for he himself is full of himself, and <lb/>
            he is sufficient for himself, and he existed before the creation <lb/>
            of the world, and equally after the creation of the universe ; for <lb/>
            he is immovable and unchangeable, having no need of any <lb/>
            other thing or being whatever, so that all things belong to him, <lb/>
            but, properly speaking, he does not belong to anything. And <lb/>
            of the powers which he has extended towards creation for the <lb/>
            advantage of the world which is thus put together, some are <lb/>
            spoken of, as it were, in relation to these things; as for <lb/>
            instance his kingly and his beneficent power; for he is the <lb/>
            king of something, and the benefactor of something there <note type="footnote"> * Exodus xx. 2. </note><note type="footnote"> ‡ Deuteronomy xxxiii. 1. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Deuteronomy iv. 1. </note><note type="footnote"> Genesis xvii. 1, </note> <note type="footnote"> R 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="244"/>
            being inevitably something which is ruled over and which <lb/>
            receives the benefits.</p>
          <p>Akin to these powers is the creative power which is called <lb/>
            God: for by means of this power the Father, who begot and <lb/>
            created all things, did also disperse and arrange them ; so that <lb/>
            the expression, “ I am thy God," is equivalent to, " I am thv <lb/>
            maker and creator ;” and it is the greatest of all possible gifts <lb/>
            to have him for one's maker, who has also been the maker of <lb/>
            the whole world. The soul, indeed, of the wicked man he did <lb/>
            not make, for wickedness is hateful to God : and the soul, <lb/>
            which is between good and bad, he made not by himself alone, <lb/>
            according to the most sacred historian Moses, since that, like <lb/>
            wax, was about to receive the different impressions of good and <lb/>
            evil. On which account it is said in the scriptures, "Let us <lb/>
            make man in our own image," that if it receives a bad im­ <lb/>
            pression it may appear to be the work of others, but if it re­ <lb/>
            ceives a good impression it may then appear to be the work of <lb/>
            him who is the Creator only of what is beautiful and good.</p>
          <p>By all means, therefore, that must be a good man to whom <lb/>
            he says, " I am thy God," as he has had him alone for his <lb/>
            creator without the co-operation of any other being. More­ <lb/>
            over he brings up with this that doctrine which is established <lb/>
            in many other passages, showing that God is the creator only <lb/>
            of those men who are virtuous and wise; and the whole of this <lb/>
            company has voluntarily deprived itself of the abundant <lb/>
            possession of external things, and has neglected those things <lb/>
            which are dear to the flesh. For the athletes of vigorous <lb/>
            health and high spirit have erected their servile bodies as a <lb/>
            sort of fortification against the soul, but those men who have <lb/>
            been devoted to the pursuit of instruction, and who are pale, <lb/>
            and weak, and emaciated, having overloaded the vigour of the <lb/>
            body with the powers of the soul, and, if one must tell the <lb/>
            plain truth, being entirely dissolved into one species of soul, <lb/>
            have through the energy of their minds become quite disen­ <lb/>
            tangled from the body.</p>
          <p>Therefore that which is earthly is very naturally destroyed <lb/>
            and overwhelmed when the entire mind resolves in every <lb/>
            particular to make itself acceptable to God. But the race of <lb/>
            these persons is rare and scarcely to be found, and one may <lb/>
            almost say is unable to exist; and the following oracle, which <lb/>
            is given with respect to Enoch, proves this: " Enoch pleased <lb/>
             <pb n="245"/>
            God, and be was not found for by what kind of contem­ <lb/>
            plation could a man attain to this good thing? What seas <lb/>
            must he cross over ? What islands, or what continents, must <lb/>
            he visit? Must he dwell among the Greeks or among the <lb/>
            barbarians ? Are there not even to the present day some of <lb/>
            those persons who have attained to perfection in philosophy, <lb/>
            who say that there is no such thing as wisdom in the world, <lb/>
            since there is also no such thing as a wise mali ? for that from <lb/>
            the very beginning of the creation of mankind up to the <lb/>
            present moment, there has never been any one who could be <lb/>
            considered entirely blameless, for that it is impossible for a <lb/>
            man who is bound up in a mortal body to be entirely and <lb/>
            altogether happy.</p>
          <p>Now whether these things are said correctly we will consider <lb/>
            at the proper time: but at present let us stick to the subject <lb/>
            before us, and follow the scripture, and say that there is such <lb/>
            a thing as wisdom existing, and that he who loves wisdom is <lb/>
            wise. But though the wise man has thus an actual existence <lb/>
            he has escaped the notice of us who are wicked: for what is <lb/>
            good will not unite with what is bad. On this account it is <lb/>
            that " the disposition which pleased God was not found as if <lb/>
            in truth it had a real existence, but was concealed and had fled <lb/>
            away to avoid any meeting in the same place with us, since it <lb/>
            is said to have been translated; the meaning of which ex­ <lb/>
            pression is that it emigrated and departed from its sojourn in <lb/>
            this mortal life, to an abode in immortal life.</p>
          <p>V. These men then, being mad with this divinely inspired <lb/>
            madness, were made more ferocious ; but there are others who <lb/>
            are companions of a more manageable and humanised wisdom. <lb/>
            By those men piety is practised to a most eminent degree, <lb/>
            and the observance due to man is not neglected. And the <lb/>
            sacred oracles are witnesses of this in which Abraham is <lb/>
            addressed (the words being put in the mouth of God), "Thou <lb/>
            shalt be pleasing in my sight,”† that is to say, thou shalt be <lb/>
            pleasing, not only to me but also to my works, in my eyes as <lb/>
            judge, and overseer, and superintendant; for if you honour your <lb/>
            parents, or show mercy to the poor, or do good to your friends, <lb/>
            or fight in defence of your country, or pay proper attention to <lb/>
            the common principles of justice towards all men, you most <note type="footnote"> * Genesis v. 24. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Genesis xvii. 3. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="246"/>
            certainly are pleasing to those with whom you associate, and <lb/>
            you are also acceptable in the sight of God: for he sees all <lb/>
            things with an eye which never slumbers, and he unites to <lb/>
            himself with especial favour all that is good, and that he accepts <lb/>
            and embraces.</p>
          <p>Therefore the practiser of virtue, even while praying, proves <lb/>
            the very same thing, saying, " The God to whom my fathers <lb/>
            were acceptable,”* and he adds also the words " before him," <lb/>
            for the sake of giving you to know the difference, the real prac­ <lb/>
            tical difference between the expression, " to please God," by <lb/>
            itself, and the same words with the addition of the sentence, <lb/>
            “ before him." For the one expression gives both meanings, <lb/>
            and the other only one. Thus also Moses, in his exhortatory <lb/>
            admonitions, recommends his disciples such and such things, <lb/>
            saying, " Thou shalt do what is pleasing before the Lord thy <lb/>
            God,”† as if he were to say, Do such things as shall be worthy <lb/>
            to appear before God, and what he when he sees them will <lb/>
            accept. And these things are wont to appear equally pure <lb/>
            both externally and internally.† And proceeding onwards <lb/>
            from thence he wove the tent of the tabernacle with two <lb/>
            boundaries of space, placing a veil between the two, in order to <lb/>
            separate what is within from what is without. And also he <lb/>
            gilded the sacred ark, the place wherein the laws were kept, <lb/>
            both within and without; and he gave the great high priest <lb/>
            two robes, the inner one made of linen, and the outer one <lb/>
            beautifully embroidered, with one robe reaching to the feet.</p>
          <p>For these and such things as these are symbols of the soul <lb/>
            which in its inner parts shows itself pure towards God, and in its <lb/>
            exterior parts shows itself without reproach in reference to the <lb/>
            world which is perceptible to the outward senses and to this <lb/>
            life : with great felicity therefore was this said to the victorious <lb/>
            wrestler, when he was about to have his brows crowned with <lb/>
            the garlands of victory : and the declaration made with respect <lb/>
            to him was of the following tenor, " You have been mightily <lb/>
            powerful both with God and with men ;”§ for to have a good <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xlviii. 15. </note><note type="footnote"> + Deuteronomy xii. 28. </note><note type="footnote"> ‡ This passage is given up by Mangey as corrupt. The text has <lb/>

            reputation with both classes, namely, with the uncreated God <lb/>
            and with the creature, is the task of no small mind, but, if one <lb/>
            must say the truth, it is one fit for that which is in the cou­ <lb/>
            fines between the world and God.</p>
          <p>In short, it is necessary that the good man should be an <lb/>
            attendant of God, for the creature is an object of care to the <lb/>
            Ruler and Father of the universe; for who is there who does <lb/>
            not know, that even before the creation of the world God was <lb/>
            himself sufficient to himself, and that he remained as much a <lb/>
            friend as before after the creation of the world, without having <lb/>
            undergone any change ? Why then did he make what did not <lb/>
            exist before ? Because he was good and bounteous. Shall we <lb/>
            not then, we who are slaves, follow our master, admiring, in an <lb/>
            exceeding degree, the great first Cause of all things, and not <lb/>
            altogether despising our own nature ?</p>
          <p>VI. But after he has said, “ Be thou pleasing to me before <lb/>
            me," he adds further, " and be thou blameless," using here a <lb/>
            natural consequence and connection of the previous sentence. <lb/>
            Do thou therefore all the more apply thyself to what is good <lb/>
            that thou mayest be pleasing; and if thou canst not be <lb/>
            pleasing, at all events abstain from open sins, that thou may­ <lb/>
            est not incur reproach. For he who does right is praise­ <lb/>
            worthy, and he who avoids doing wrong is not to be blamed. <lb/>
            And the most important prize is assigned to those who do <lb/>
            right, namely, the prize of feeling that they are acceptable to <lb/>
            God: but the second prize belongs to those who do no sin, <lb/>
            that, namely, of avoiding blame; and, perhaps, in the case of <lb/>
            the mortal race of mankind, the doing no sin is set down as <lb/>
            equivalent to doing right; for who, as Job says, is " pure from <lb/>
            pollution, even if his life be but one single day long ?"*</p>
          <p>In fact, the things which pollute the soul are infinite in <lb/>
            number, and it is impossible completely to wash them away <lb/>
            and to efface their stains; for there are, of necessity, left dis­ <lb/>
            asters which are akin to every mortal man, which it is natural <lb/>
            indeed to weaken, but impossible wholly to eradicate. Does <lb/>
            any one therefore seek a just, or prudent, or temperate, or, in <lb/>
            short, any perfectly good man, in this confused life ? Be con­ <lb/>
            tent if you find one who is not wholly unjust, or foolish, or in­ <lb/>
            temperate, or cowardly, or who is not utterly worthless; for <lb/>
            the avoidance of evil is a thing with which to be content, but <note type="footnote"> * Job xiv. 4. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="248"/>
            the complete acquisition of the virtues is unattainable to any <lb/>
            man, such as is endowed with our nature.</p>
          <p>It was therefore with great reason that it was said, " and be <lb/>
            thou blameless," the speaker thinking that it is a great ad­ <lb/>
            dition towards a happy life to live without sin and without <lb/>
            reproach; but the man who has deliberately chosen this way <lb/>
            of life, promises to leave his inheritance in accordance with the <lb/>
            covenant, such as-is becoming to God to give, and to a wise <lb/>
            man to accept, for he says, "I will place'my covenant be­ <lb/>
            tween me and between thee;”* and covenants and testaments <lb/>
            are written for the advantage of those who are worthy of the <lb/>
            gift, so that a testament is a symbol of grace, which God has <lb/>
            placed between himself who proffers it and man who receives <lb/>
            it; and this is the very extravagance of beneficence, that there <lb/>
            is nothing between God and the soul except his own virgin <lb/>
            grace. And I have written two commentaries on the whole, <lb/>
            discussion concerning testaments, and for that reason I now <lb/>
            deliberately pass over that subject, for the sake of not appear­ <lb/>
            ing to repeat what I have said before; and also at the same <lb/>
            time, because I do not wish here to interrupt the connected <lb/>
            course of this discussion.</p>
          <p>VII. And immediately afterwards it is said, " And Abra­ <lb/>
            ham fell on his face:” was he not about, in accordance with <lb/>
            the divine promises, to recognize himself and the nothingness <lb/>
            of the race of mankind, and so to fall down before him who <lb/>
            stood firm, by way of displaying the conception which he en­ <lb/>
            tertained of himself and of God ? Forsooth that God, standing <lb/>
            always in the same place, moves the whole composition of the <lb/>
            world, not by means of his legs, for he has not the form of a <lb/>
            man, but by showing his unalterable and immovable essence. <lb/>
            But man, being never settled firmly in the same place, admits <lb/>
            of different changes at different times, and being tripped up, <lb/>
            miserable man that he is (for, in fact, his whole life is one <lb/>
            continued stumble), he meets with a terrible fall; but he who <lb/>
            does this against his will is ignorant, and he who does it <lb/>
            voluntarily is docile; on which account he is said to fall on his <lb/>
            face, that is to say, in his outward senses, in his speech, in <lb/>
            his mind, all but crying out loudly and shouting that the out­ <lb/>
            ward sense has fallen, inasmuch as it was unable, by itself, to <lb/>
            feel as it should, if it had not been aroused by the provi­ <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xvii. 2. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="249"/>
            dence of the Saviour, to take hold of the bodies which lay in <lb/>
            its way. And speech too has fallen, being unable to give a <lb/>
            proper explanation of anything in existence, unless he who <lb/>
            originally made and adapted the organ of the voice, having <lb/>
            opened its mouth and enabled its tongue to articulate, should <lb/>
            strike it so as to produce harmonious sounds. Moreover, the <lb/>
            king of all the mind has fallen, being deprived of its compre­ <lb/>
            hension, unless the Creator of all living things were again to <lb/>
            raise it up and re-establish it, and furnishing it with the most <lb/>
            acutely seeing eyes, to lead it to a sight of incorporeal things.</p>
          <p>VIII. Therefore admiring this same disposition when thus <lb/>
            taking to flight, and submitting to a voluntary fall by reason of <lb/>
            the confession which it had made respecting the living God, <lb/>
            namely, that he stands in truth and is one only, while all <lb/>
            other things beneath him are subject to all kinds of motions <lb/>
            and alterations, he speaks to it, and allows it to enter into <lb/>
            conversation with him, saying, “ And I, behold my covenant is <lb/>
            with thee."* And this expression conceals beneath its figura­ <lb/>
            tive words such a meaning as this: There are very many <lb/>
            kinds of covenants, which distribute graces and gifts to those <lb/>
            who are worthy to receive them ; but the highest kind of cove­ <lb/>
            nant of all is I myself: for God, having displayed himself as <lb/>
            far as it was possible for that being to be displayed who can­ <lb/>
            not be shown by the words which he has used, adds further, <lb/>
            " And I too, behold my covenant;” the beginning and fouu­ <lb/>
            tain of all graces is I myself.</p>
          <p>For on some persons God is in the habit of bestowing his <lb/>
            graces by the intervention of others; as, for instance, through <lb/>
            the medium of earth, water, air, the sun, the moon, heaven, <lb/>
            and other incorporeal powers. But he bestows them on others <lb/>
            through himself alone, exhibiting himself as the inheritance <lb/>
            of those who receive him, whom from that he thinks worthy <lb/>
            of another appellation : for it is said in the scripture, " Thy <lb/>
            name shall not be called Abram, but Abraham shall thy name <lb/>
            be." Some, then, of those persons who are foud of disputes, <lb/>
            and who are always eager to affix a stain upon what is irre­ <lb/>
            proachable, on things as well as bodies, and who wage an <lb/>
            implacable war against sacred things, while they calumniate <lb/>
            everything which does not appear to preserve strict decorum in <lb/>
            speech, being the symbols of nature which is always fond of <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xvii. 4. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="250"/>
            being concealed, perverting it all so as to give it a worse ap­ <lb/>
            pearance after a very accurate investigation, do especially find <lb/>
            fault with the changes of names.</p>
          <p>And it is only lately that I heard an ungodly and impious <lb/>
            man mocking and ridiculing these things, who ventured to say, <lb/>
            " Surely they are great and exceeding gifts which Moses says <lb/>
            that the Ruler of the universe offers, who, by the addition of <lb/>
            one element, the one letter alpha, a superfluous element;* <lb/>
            and then again adding another element, the letter rho, appears <lb/>
            to have bestowed upon men a most marvellous and great <lb/>
            benefit; for he has called the wife of Abram Sarrah instead of <lb/>
            Sarah, doubling the Rho,” and connecting a number of similar <lb/>
            arguments without drawing breath, and joking and mocking, <lb/>
            he went. through many instances. But at no distant period he <lb/>
            suffered a suitable punishment for his insane wickedness ; for <lb/>
            on a very slight and ordinary provocation he hanged himself, <lb/>
            in order that so polluted and impure a person might not die by <lb/>
            a pure and unpolluted death.</p>
          <p>IX. But we may justly, in order to prevent any one else <lb/>
            from falling into the same error, eradicate the erroneous notions <lb/>
            which have been formed on the subject, arguing the matter on <lb/>
            the principle of natural philosophy, and proving that these <lb/>
            things which are here said are worthy of all attention. God <lb/>
            does not bestow on men mutes and vowels, or, in short, nouns <lb/>
            and verbs ; since when he created plants and animals, he sum­ <lb/>
            moned them before man as their governor, that he might give <lb/>
            each of them their appropriate names by a reference to the <lb/>
            knowledge which he had of all things ; for, says the scripture, <lb/>
            “ Whatever Adam called any thing, that was the name <lb/>
            thereof, t</p>
          <p>Therefore since God did not think fit to take upon himself <lb/>
            even the active imposition of the names, but entrusted the <lb/>
            task to a wise man, the author of the whole race of mankind, <lb/>
            is it reasonable to suppose that he himself gave and arranged <lb/>
            the different parts, and syllables, and letters of nouns, disposing <lb/>
            not only the vowels, but even the mutes, and that he did this <lb/>
            too to make a show of liberality and exceeding beneficence ? <lb/>
            It is impossible to say so. But such things as these are the <note type="footnote"> * The text here is very corrupt. Mangey adopts the emendations. <lb/>
            of Markland, and I have followed his translation. </note><note type="footnote"> t Genesis ii. 19. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="251"/>
            characteristic marks of different powers ; small marks of great <lb/>
            powers, marks perceptible by the outward senses of powers <lb/>
            appreciable only by the intellect, manifest marks of powers <lb/>
            which are indistinct; and the powers themselves are discerned <lb/>
            in most excellent doctrines, in true and pure conceptions, in <lb/>
            the improvement of souls.</p>
          <p>And it is easy to see a proof of this if we make a beginning <lb/>
            with the man who is here spoken of as having his name <lb/>
            changed; for the name Abram, being interpreted, means <lb/>
            " sublime father," but Abraham means the " elect father of <lb/>
            sound;" and how these names differ from one another we <lb/>
            shall know more clearly if we first of all read what is exhibited <lb/>
            under each of them. Now using allegorical language, we call <lb/>
            that man sublime who raises himself from the earth to a height, <lb/>
            and who devotes himself to the inspection of high things; and <lb/>
            we also call him a haunter of high regions, and a meteorolo­ <lb/>
            gist, inquiring what is the magnitude of the sun, what are his <lb/>
            motions, how he influences the seasons of the year, advancing <lb/>
            as he does and retreating back again, with revolutions of equal <lb/>
            speed, and investigating as he does the subjects of the radiance <lb/>
            of the moon, of its shape, of its waning, of its increase, and of <lb/>
            the motion of the other stars, whether fixed or wandering; <lb/>
            for the inquiry into these matters belongs not to an ill-con­ <lb/>
            ditioned or barren soul, but to one which is eminently endowed <lb/>
            by nature, and which is able to produce an entire and perfect <lb/>
            offspring ; on which account the scripture calls the meteorolo­ <lb/>
            gist "father," inasmuch as he is not unproductive of wisdom.</p>
          <p>X. Now the symbols represented by the name of Abram are <lb/>
            thus accurately defined; those conveyed under the name of <lb/>
            Abrallam are such as we shall proceed to demonstrate. The <lb/>
            meanings now are three, " the father," and " elect," and “of <lb/>
            sound." Now by the word " sound " here, we mean uttered <lb/>
            speech ; for the sounding organ of the living animal is the <lb/>
            organ of speech. Of this faculty we say that the father is the <lb/>
            mind, for it is from the mind, as from a fountain, that the <lb/>
            stream of speech proceeds. The word " elect " belongs to the <lb/>
            mind of the wise man, for whatever is most excellent is found <lb/>
            in him; therefore the man devoted to learning and occupied <lb/>
            in the contemplation of sublime subjects, was sketched out <lb/>
            according to the former characteristic marks, but the philoso­ <lb/>
            pher, or I should rather say the wise man, was exhibited in <lb/>
             <pb n="252"/>
            accordance with those of which we have just given an <lb/>
            outline.</p>
          <p>Think not, then, any longer that the Deity bestows a change <lb/>
            of names, but consider that what lie gives is a correction of the <lb/>
            moral character by means of symbols; for having invited the <lb/>
            man who formerly busied himself about the subject of the <lb/>
            nature of heaven, and whom some call a mathematician, to a <lb/>
            participation in virtue, he made him wise and called him so. <lb/>
            For having given an appropriate name to his transformed dis­ <lb/>
            position, he named him, as the Hebrews would call it, "Abra­ <lb/>
            ham," but in the language of the Greeks, " the elect father of <lb/>
            sound ;” for says he, On what account dost thou investigate <lb/>
            the motions and periods of the stars ? and why hast thou <lb/>
            bounded up so high from the earth to the heavens? Is it <lb/>
            merely that you may indulge your curiosity with respect to <lb/>
            those matters ? And what advantage could accrue to you <lb/>
            from all this curiosity ? What destruction of pleasure would <lb/>
            it cause ? What defeat of appetite ? What dissolution of <lb/>
            pain or fear ? What eradication of the passions which disturb <lb/>
            and agitate the soul? For as there is no advantage in trees <lb/>
            unless they are productive of fruit, so in the same way there is <lb/>
            no use in the study of natural philosophy unless it is likely to <lb/>
            confer upon a man the acquisition of virtue, for that is its <lb/>
            proper fruit.</p>
          <p>On which account some of the ancients have compared the <lb/>
            discussion and consideration of philosophy to a field, and have <lb/>
            likened the physical portion of it to the plants, the logical part <lb/>
            to the hedges and fences, the moral part to the fruit, thinking <lb/>
            that the walls which are built around for the sake of protecting <lb/>
            the fruit have been erected by the possessors of the land, and <lb/>
            that the plants have been created for the sake of the produc­ <lb/>
            tion of fruit; thus, therefore, they said that in philosophy it is <lb/>
            requisite for the consideration of the physical and the logical <lb/>
            part of philosophy to be referred to the moral part, by which <lb/>
            the moral character is improved, which has a desire at the <lb/>
            same time for both the acquisition and the use of virtue. <lb/>
            This is the lesson which we have been taught concerning the <lb/>
            man who in word indeed had his name changed, but who in <lb/>
            reality changed his nature from the consideration of natural to <lb/>
            that of moral philosophy, and who abandoned the contempla­ <lb/>
            tion of the world itself for the knowledge of the Being who <lb/>
             <pb n="253"/>
            created the world ; by which knowledge he acquired piety, the <lb/>
            most excellent of all possessions.</p>
          <p>XI. We will now speak of his wife, Sarah, for she too had <lb/>
            her name changed to Sarrah by the addition of the one <lb/>
            element, the letter rho. These, then, are the names, and we <lb/>
            must now explain what they mean. Sarah, being interpreted, <lb/>
            signifies "my authority," but Sarrah signifies “ princess;” <lb/>
            the former name, therefore, is a symbol of specific virtue, but <lb/>
            the latter of generic virtue. But in proportion as genus is <lb/>
            superior to species in regard of quantity, in the same propor­ <lb/>
            tion does the latter name excel the former; for species is <lb/>
            something small and perishable, but genus is numerous and <lb/>
            immortal, and the intention of God is to bestow great and <lb/>
            immortal things instead of such as are small and perishable, <lb/>
            and this is a task suited to his dignity.</p>
          <p>Now the prudence which exists in the virtuous man is the <lb/>
            authority of himself alone, and he who has it would not err if <lb/>
            he were to say, my authority is the prudence which is in me; <lb/>
            but that which has stretched out this authority is generic <lb/>
            prudence, not any longer the authority of this or that person, <lb/>
            but absolute intrinsic authority; therefore that which exists <lb/>
            only in species will perish at the same time with its possessor, <lb/>
            but that which, like a seal, has stamped it with an impression, <lb/>
            is free from all mortality, and will remain for ever and ever <lb/>
            imperishable. Thus also those arts which exist only in species <lb/>
            perish along with those who have acquired them, such as <lb/>
            geometricians, grammarians, and musicians, but the generic <lb/>
            arts remain exempt from destruction. And, again, he gives <lb/>
            an additional sketch of his meaning when he teaches by the <lb/>
            same name that every virtue is a princess, and a queen, and a <lb/>
            ruler of all the affairs of life.</p>
          <p>XII. But it has also happened that Jacob had his name <lb/>
            changed to Israel; and this, too, was a felicitous alteration. <lb/>
            Why so ? Because the name Jacob means “ a supplanter," <lb/>
            but the name Israel signifies “ the man who sees God." Now <lb/>
            it is the employment of a supplanter, who practises virtue, to <lb/>
            move, and disturb, and upset the foundations of passion on <lb/>
            which it is established, and whatever there is of any strength <lb/>
            which is founded on them. But these things are not brought <lb/>
            about without a struggle or without severe labour; but only <lb/>
            when any one, having gone through all the labours of prudence, <lb/>
             <pb n="254"/>
            then proceeds to practise himself in the exercises of the soul <lb/>
            and to wrestle against the reasonings which are hostile to it, <lb/>
            and which seek to torment it ; but it is the part of him who <lb/>
            sees God not to depart from the sacred contest without the <lb/>
            crown of victory, but rather to carry off the prize of triumph. <lb/>
            And what more flourishing and more suitable crown could be <lb/>
            woven for the victorious soul than one by which it will be able <lb/>
            acutely and clearly to behold the living God? At least a <lb/>
            beautiful prize is thus proposed for the soul which delights in <lb/>
            the practice of virtue, namely, the being endowed with sight <lb/>
            adequate to the clear comprehension of the only thing which is <lb/>
            really worth beholding.</p>
          <p>XIII. And it is worth while here to raise the question why <lb/>
            Abraham, from the time that his name was changed, is always <lb/>
            thought worthy of this same appellation, and is no longer <lb/>
            called by his former name; but Jacob, who is also called <lb/>
            Israel, is nevertheless called Jacob too, as he was before the <lb/>
            change of his name; and, indeed, is called Jacob oftener than <lb/>
            Israel.</p>
          <p>We must say, then, that these facts are characters by which <lb/>
            it is seen that the virtue which is taught differs from that <lb/>
            which is acquired by practice ; for the man who is improved <lb/>
            by instruction, having received a happy and virtuous nature, <lb/>
            uses that virtue alone which, by means of memory co-operating <lb/>
            with it, implants in him an absence of forgetfulness, so that he <lb/>
            comprehends and takes firm hold of all the" things which he <lb/>
            has once learnt ; but he who practises virtue, since he is con­ <lb/>
            tinually exercising himself, stops to take breath, and relaxes <lb/>
            his efforts for- a while, collecting himself and recovering the <lb/>
            vigour which was a little impaired by his exertions, just as <lb/>
            those men do who have oiled their bodies for the contests in <lb/>
            the arena For these men, also, labouring at their training <lb/>
            exercises, in order to prevent their powers being utterly broken <lb/>
            down, anoint themselves with oil on account of the violent and <lb/>
            continued nature of their exercise</p>
          <p>Then the man who is improved by instruction, having an <lb/>
            immortal monitor, receives from him a harmonious and impe­ <lb/>
            rishable advantage, without suffering any change ; but the <lb/>
            practiser of virtue is impelled to action by his own inclination <lb/>
            alone, and he exercises himself in it, and labours at it in order <lb/>
            to change that passion, which is akin to a created being; and <lb/>
             <pb n="255"/>
            even if he attains to perfection, he still, being fatigued, returns <lb/>
            to his ancient kind of labour; for he is more inclined to endure <lb/>
            toil, but the other is more fortunate, for he has another person <lb/>
            as a teacher. But this man, by his own unassisted efforts, <lb/>
            investigates, and inquires, and pushes his examination, investi­ <lb/>
            gating the mysteries of nature with great earnestness, and <lb/>
            exerting continual and incessant labour.</p>
          <p>For this reason God, who never changes, altered the name <lb/>
            of Abrabam, since he was about to remain in a similar condi­ <lb/>
            tion, in order that that which was to be firmly established <lb/>
            might be confirmed by him who was standing firmly, and who <lb/>
            was remaining in the same state in the same manner. But it <lb/>
            was an angel who altered the name of Jacob, being the Word, <lb/>
            the minister of God ; in order that it might be confessed and <lb/>
            ascertained, that there is none of the things whose existence is <lb/>
            subsequent to that of the living God, which is the cause or <lb/>
            unchangeable and unvarying firmness . . . . . . but of that <lb/>
            harmony which, as in a musical instrument, contains the <lb/>
            intensity and relaxation of sounds so as to produce an artistical <lb/>
            combination of melody.</p>
          <p>XIV. But, there being three leaders and authors of this <lb/>
            race, the two at each extremity of it had their names changed, <lb/>
            namely Abraham and Jacob : but the one in the middle, Isaac, <lb/>
            always retained the same appellation. Why was this? <lb/>
            Because both that virtue which is derived from teaching and <lb/>
            that which is attained to by practice, admit of improvement <lb/>
            and advancement: for the man who receives instruction <lb/>
            desires a knowledge of those matters of which he is ignorant <lb/>
            and he who applies himself to practice desires the crowns of <lb/>
            victory, and the prizes which -are proposed to his industrious <lb/>
            and contemplation-loving soul. But the race which is self- <lb/>
            taught and which derives all its learning from its own dili­ <lb/>
            gence, inasmuch as it exists rather by nature than by study, <lb/>
            was at the very beginning introduced as equal, and perfect, <lb/>
            and even, there being no number whatever deficient of those <lb/>
            which tend to completeness.</p>
          <p>Nor indeed does Joseph have any such need, he who is the <lb/>
            president of the necessities of the body ; for he also changes <lb/>
            his name, being called Psonthomphanech by the king of the <lb/>
            country. And what the meaning of these names is we must <lb/>
            explain; the name Joseph, being interpreted, signifies “ an <lb/>
             <pb n="256"/>
            addition” For things which are put by the side are an <lb/>
            addition to those which exist by nature ; for instance, gold, <lb/>
            silver, possessions, revenues, the ministrations of servants, <lb/>
            abundant treasure of heirlooms, and furniture, and other <lb/>
            superfluities, and the infinite multitude of the different <lb/>
            efficients of pleasure which some persons possess; the <lb/>
            provider and superintendant of which was called Joseph, or <lb/>
            addition, by a very felicitous nomenclature : since he had <lb/>
            undertaken the superintendence of the things which were to <lb/>
            be brought in from without, and added to the natural things <lb/>
            previously existing in the course of nature. And the sacred <lb/>
            scriptures testify that this is the case, showing that he was the <lb/>
            purveyor of the food of all the corporeal region, Egypt, having <lb/>
            stored it up in his treasure-houses.</p>
          <p>XV. Such a person as this, then, Joseph is recognized as <lb/>
            being by his distinctive marks and name. Let us now see <lb/>
            what sort of person is indicated by the name Psonthomphanech. <lb/>
            Now this name being interpreted means, "a mouth judging <lb/>
            in an answer ;” for every foolish person thinks that the man <lb/>
            who is very rich and overflowing with external possessions, <lb/>
            - must at once be wise and sensible, competent to give an <lb/>
            answer to any question which any one puts to him, aud com­ <lb/>
            petent also of his own head to deliver advantageous and <lb/>
            sagacious opinions. And, in short, by such men prudence is <lb/>
            supposed to be identical with good fortune, while one ought, <lb/>
            on the contrary, to consider good fortune as consisting in being <lb/>
            prudent ; for it is fitting that what is unstable should be <lb/>
            under the direction of that which stands firmly.</p>
          <p>And indeed his father gave to his own uterine brother the <lb/>
            name of Benjamin :* but his mother called him the son of her <lb/>
            sorrow, speaking most completely in accordance with nature. <lb/>
            For the name Benjamill being interpreted means, “ the son of <lb/>
            days:" and the day is illuminated by that light of the sun <lb/>
            which is perceptible by the outward senses: and to this we <lb/>
            liken vain glory. For that has a certain brilliancy appreciable <lb/>
            by the outward senses in the praises which it receives from the <lb/>
            multitude and from the common herd of men, in formally <lb/>
            enrolled decrees, in the erection of statues and images, in <lb/>
            purple robes and golden crowns, in chariots and teams of four <lb/>
            horses, and processions of the multitude. He therefore who <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xxxv. IS. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="257"/>
            is an admirer and desirer of such things is very appropriately <lb/>
            called a soil of days: that is to say, of that light which is per­ <lb/>
            ceptible by the outward senses and of the brilliancy which at­ <lb/>
            tends vain glory. This felicitous and appropriate name the <lb/>
            elder word and real father imposes on him; but the soul which <lb/>
            has suffered gives him a name suited to what she has suffered. <lb/>
            For she calls him the son of her sorrow. Why so? Because <lb/>
            those men who are borne about by vain glory are supposed in­ <lb/>
            deed to be happy, but in real truth are unhappy. For the things <lb/>
            which oppose their happiness are numerous, envy, discontent, <lb/>
            emulation, continual strife, irreconcileable enmities lasting till <lb/>
            death, hostilities handed down in succession to one's children's <lb/>
            children—a destiny not at all to be desired. Very necessarily <lb/>
            therefore did the divinely inspired prophet represent that <lb/>
            vain glory as dying in the very act of bringing forth ; for says <lb/>
            he, " Rachel died, having had a bad delivery." * Since, in <lb/>
            truth and reality, the sowing and generation of vain glory per­ <lb/>
            ceptible by the outward senses is the death of the soul.</p>
          <p>XVI. And what shall we say of the sons of Joseph, Ephra­ <lb/>
            im and Manasseh ? Are they not, in strict accordance with <lb/>
            nature, compared to the two eldest sons of Jacob, Reuben and <lb/>
            Simeon ? For the scripture says, " Thy two sons who were <lb/>
            born in Egypt, before that I came into Egypt, belong to me; <lb/>
            Ephraim and Manasseh shall be to me as Reuben and as <lb/>
            Simeon."t Let us now then see in what manner the one pair <lb/>
            are likened to the other pair.</p>
          <p>Reuben is the symbol of a good natural disposition, for the <lb/>
            name being interpreted means, " A seeing son;" since every <lb/>
            one who is endowed with tolerable acuteness of mind and a <lb/>
            good disposition is capable of seeing; and Ephraim, as we <lb/>
            have already frequently said in other places, is a symbol of <lb/>
            memory, for his name being interpreted signifies, " produc­ <lb/>
            tiveness of fruit," and the most excellent fruit of the soul is <lb/>
            memory; and there is no, one thing so nearly akin to another <lb/>
            as remembering is to a man of good natural endowments. <lb/>
            Again, the name of Simeon is a symbol of learning and in­ <lb/>
            struction ; for, being interpreted, it signifies " listening," and <lb/>
            it is the especial part of a learner to listen and attend to what <lb/>
            is said. But Manasseh is a symbol of " recollection," for <lb/>
            thus that art is called, from forgetfulness; for it must of ne­ <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xxxv. 1G. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Genesis xlviii. 5. </note> <note type="footnote"> VOL. II. </note> <note type="footnote"> s </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="258"/>
            cessity happen to the man who has advanced out of forget­ <lb/>
            fulness to recollect, and recollecting especially belongs to <lb/>
            learning, for very often his notions escape from the man who <lb/>
            is learning, as out of weakness he is unable to retain them, <lb/>
            and then again they return to him as at the beginning.</p>
          <p>The condition therefore which arises from this escaping of <lb/>
            his notions is denominated forgetfulness, and that which arises <lb/>
            from their returning to him is called recollection. Now is not <lb/>
            memory very naturally spoken of as connected with good <lb/>
            natural endowments, and recollection as akin to learning ? <lb/>
            And, indeed, the same relation which Simeon bears to Reu­ <lb/>
            ben, that is to say, learning to natural endowment, the same <lb/>
            does Manasseh bear to Ephraim, and the same does recollec­ <lb/>
            tion bear to memory. For as the man of good natural endow­ <lb/>
            ments is better than he who is only a learner, for the one <lb/>
            resembles the sense of seeing, the other that of hearing, and <lb/>
            hearing is always reckoned as entitled to a lesser honour than <lb/>
            seeing; so also, he who is endowed with a good memory is at <lb/>
            all times superior to him who only recollects, because the one <lb/>
            is combined with forgetfulness, but the other continues unal­ <lb/>
            loyed and unadulterated from beginning to end.</p>
          <p>XVII. And indeed the scriptures at one time call the <lb/>
            father-in-law of the first of the prophets Jother, and at another <lb/>
            time Raguel-Jother, when pride is flourishing and at its <lb/>
            height; for the name Jother being interpreted means " super­ <lb/>
            fluous,” and pride is superfluous in an honest and sincere life, <lb/>
            turning into ridicule, as it does, all that is equal and necessary <lb/>
            to life, and honouring the unequal things of excess and <lb/>
            covetousness. This passion honours human things above <lb/>
            divine, and customs above laws, and profane above sacred <lb/>
            things, and mortal above immortal things, and, in short, <lb/>
            appearances above reality; and it even ventures of its own <lb/>
            accord to pass on into the rank of counsellors, suggesting to the <lb/>
            wise man not to teach those things which alone are worthy to <lb/>
            be known, namely, " the commandments of God, and the <lb/>
            law,"* but to study the covenants and contracts of men with <lb/>
            one another, which are almost the causes of the society which <lb/>
            exists among them being so little sociable.</p>
          <p>But the great man is obedient in all things, thinking that <lb/>
            little things are adapted to little people, and that great things <note type="footnote"> * Exodus xviii. 11. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="259"/>
            are justly added to the great; but very often this man who is <lb/>
            wise in his own conceit, and who, passing over from the herds <lb/>
            which the blind had assigned to him for him to guide, having <lb/>
            sought out the divine herd, becomes no small portion of it; <lb/>
            admiring the leader of nature, and marvelling at his way of <lb/>
            leading which he employs in his care of his own flocks, for the <lb/>
            name Raguel being interpreted, signifies the " pastoral care of <lb/>
            God."*</p>
          <p>XVIII. The main part has now been explained; we will <lb/>
            now proceed to adduce the proofs. In the first place the <lb/>
            scripture represents him as the cultivator of judgment and of <lb/>
            justice, for the name Midian, being interpreted, means " out <lb/>
            of judgment." And this is said in a twofold sense, for some <lb/>
            times it signifies both selection and rejection, such as usually <lb/>
            happens to those who are competitors in those contests <lb/>
            which are called sacred; for numbers as they appear not <lb/>
            qualified, are rejected by the masters of the games. These are <lb/>
            the men who have been initiated in the unholy rites of Beel­ <lb/>
            phegor,f and having widened all the mouths of the body to <lb/>
            enable them to receive the streams which are poured into <lb/>
            them from without, for the name Beelphegor is interpreted <lb/>
            " the mouth above the skin," for they have overwhelmed the <lb/>
            mind, the governor of the body, and have sunk it down to the <lb/>
            lowest depth, so that it can never emerge, nor even hold up <lb/>
            its head in ever so slight a degree.</p>
          <p>And it suffered this until Phinehas, the lover of peace and <lb/>
            manifest priest of God, came as a champion of his own accord, <lb/>
            being by nature a hater of all that is evil, and filled with an <lb/>
            admiration and desire for what is good; and as he took a <lb/>
            coadjutor, that is to say, the well sharpened and sharp-edged <lb/>
            word, competent to investigate and examine everything, he <lb/>
            could not be deceived, but exerting a vigorous strength, he <lb/>
            pierced passion through her womb, that it might not hereafter <lb/>
            bring forth any divinely caused evil. Now between these men <lb/>
            and the seeing race there is a terrible war, in which no one of <lb/>
            the combatants differed in language,‡ but each returned home <lb/>
            unwounded and safe, crowned with the garlands of victory.</p>
          <p>XIX. This now is one of the things which are shown by the <lb/>
            name of Midian ; another is that more excellent and judicial <lb/>
            species which by the affinity of marriage is connected with the <note type="footnote"> ∗ Exodus ii. 18. </note> <note type="footnote"> † Numbers xxv. 1. </note> <note type="footnote">‡ Exodus xxxi. 29. </note> <note type="footnote"> S 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="260"/>
            prophetic race. The scripture then says, " The priest of judg­ <lb/>
            ment and justice " (that is to say, of Midian) " has seven <lb/>
            daughters by which seven daughters are frequently inti­ <lb/>
            mated the powers of the irrational part of the soul, the power <lb/>
            of generation and the voice, and the five outward senses, tend­ <lb/>
            ing the flocks of their father; for by means of these seven <lb/>
            powers it is that all the progresses and increases of their <lb/>
            father, the mind, exist in the perceptions which are produced <lb/>
            from him. These, then, coming each to its appropriate ob­ <lb/>
            ject, the power of sight to colours and shapes, the sense of <lb/>
            hearing to sounds, the faculty of smelling to scents, taste to <lb/>
            flavours, and all the other faculties to those objects which are <lb/>
            adapted for their exercise do in a manner imbibe some of the <lb/>
            external objects of the outward senses, until they have filled <lb/>
            all the channels of the soul, and from these channels they <lb/>
            give drink to the sheep of their father; I mean by these sheep <lb/>
            that most pure flock of the reason which bears safety and <lb/>
            ornament at the same time.</p>
          <p>But the companions of envy and jealousy, the leaders of the <lb/>
            wicked herd coming up, drive them away from that use of <lb/>
            their powers which is in accordance with nature, for some <lb/>
            conduct these things which are without, inwards to the mind as <lb/>
            to a judge and a king, in order that they may do well from <lb/>
            having the most excellent of governors; but others take the <lb/>
            opposite side, pursuing and proclaiming the exact contrary, <lb/>
            while it is possible for the mind to be drawn towards them, <lb/>
            and to give up the flock which was entrusted to it to feed.t <lb/>
            Until the good disposition, devoted to virtue and inspired by <lb/>
            God, which for awhile has appeared to be resting in inactivity, <lb/>
            by name Moses, holds his shield over them and defends them <lb/>
            from those who would attack them, nourishing the flock of his <lb/>
            father on wholesome words, and they having escaped the <lb/>
            attack of the enemies of intellect who admire only the external <lb/>
            appendages, like people in tragedies, go no longer to Jother <lb/>
            but to Raguel, for they have abandoned all connection with <lb/>
            pride, and have connected themselves with lawful persua­ <lb/>
            sion, choosing to become a portion of the sacred flock, of <note type="footnote"> * Exodus ii. 16. </note><note type="footnote"> + This passage is very corrupt in the original. I have followed <lb/>
            Mangey in adopting the corrections of Maryland. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="261"/>
            which the divine word is the leader, as his name shows, for it <lb/>
            signifies the pastoral care of God.</p>
          <p>XX. But while he is taking care of his own flock, all kinds <lb/>
            of good things are given all at once to those of the sheep who <lb/>
            are obedient, and who do not resist his will; and in the <lb/>
            Psalms we find a song in these words, " The Lord is my <lb/>
            shepherd, therefore shall I lack nothing;”* therefore the <lb/>
            mind which has had the royal shepherd, the divine word, for <lb/>
            its instructor, will very naturally ask of his seven daughters, <lb/>
            " Why is it that you have contended with such great haste to <lb/>
            come hither this day?”† for formerly, when you met with the <lb/>
            objects of the outward sense, remaining a long time outside, <lb/>
            you were a long time in returning again by reason of the <lb/>
            manner in which you were allured by them, but now I do not <lb/>
            know what it is that has happened to you, but you are speedy <lb/>
            in your return, contrary to your usual custom.</p>
          <p>Therefore they will say that there were not the same causes <lb/>
            why they should run back with such exceeding speed, making <lb/>
            the double course from the objects of the outward sense and to <lb/>
            the objects of the outward sense, without stopping to take <lb/>
            breath, and with excessive impetuosity; but that the cause <lb/>
            was rather the man who delivered them from the shepherds of <lb/>
            the wild flock.</p>
          <p>And they call Moses an Egyptian, a man who was not only <lb/>
            a Hebrew, but even a Hebrew of the very purest race, of the <lb/>
            only tribe which is consecrated, because they are unable to <lb/>
            rise above their own nature; for the outward senses, being on <lb/>
            the confines between the objects of the intellect and those of <lb/>
            the outward senses, we must be content if they aim at both of <lb/>
            them, and are not allured by the objects of the outward sense <lb/>
            alone. And to think that they are inclined only to attend to <lb/>
            the things which are purely objects of the intellect is great <lb/>
            folly; on which account they give him both these names, <lb/>
            since when they call him a man, they indicate the things <lb/>
            which are within the province of reason alone to contemplate, <lb/>
            and when they call him an Egyptian, they indicate the objects <lb/>
            of the external senses.</p>
          <p>When he has heard this, he will again inquire, "Where is <lb/>
            the man ?" In what part of you is the reasonable species <lb/>
            dwelling ? Why have you left it so easily, and have not rather <note type="footnote"> it Psalm xxiii. 1. </note> <note type="footnote"> f Exodus ii. 18. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="262"/>
            after having once met with it, preserved that which was the <lb/>
            most beautiful of possessions, and the most advantageous for <lb/>
            yourselves ? But even if you have not done so before, at least <lb/>
            call it to you now, that it may eat of and be supported by your <lb/>
            improvement and your close connection with him ; for perhaps <lb/>
            he will even dwell with you, and will bring with him the <lb/>
            winged, and divinely inspired, and prophetical race by name <lb/>
            Zipporah.</p>
          <p>XXI. Thus much we have thought fit to say on this subject. <lb/>
            But, moreover, Moses also changes the name of Hosea into <lb/>
            that of Joshua; displaying by his new name the distinctive <lb/>
            qualities of his character; for the name Hosea is interpreted, <lb/>
            " what sort of a person is this?" but Joshua means, " the <lb/>
            salvation of the Lord," being the name of the most excellent <lb/>
            possible character; for the habits are better with respect to <lb/>
            those persons who are of such and such qualities from being <lb/>
            influenced by them: as, for instance, music is better in a <lb/>
            musician, physic in a physician, and each art of a distinctive <lb/>
            quality in each artist, regarded both in its perpetuity, and in its <lb/>
            power, and in its unerring perfection with regard to the objects <lb/>
            of its speculation. For a habit is something everlasting, ener­ <lb/>
            gising, and perfect; but a man of such and such a quality is <lb/>
            mortal, the object of action, and imperfect. And what is impe­ <lb/>
            rishable is superior to what is mortal, the efficient cause is better <lb/>
            than that which is the object of action ; and what is perfect is <lb/>
            preferable to what is imperfect. In this way the coinage of <lb/>
            the above mentioned description was changed and received the <lb/>
            stamp of a better kind of appearance.</p>
          <p>And Caleb himself was changed wholly and entirely; " For," <lb/>
            as the scripture says, " a new spirit was in him;"* as if the <lb/>
            dominant part in him had been changed into complete perfec­ <lb/>
            tion ; for the name Caleb, being interpreted, means, " the <lb/>
            whole heart." And a proof of this is to be gathered from the <lb/>
            fact that the mind is changed, not by being biassed and <lb/>
            inclining in one particular direction or the other, but wholly <lb/>
            and entirely in the direction which is good; and that, even if <lb/>
            there is any thing which is not very praiseworthy indeed, it <lb/>
            makes that to depart by arguments conducive to repentance ; <lb/>
            for, having in this manner washed off all the defilements which <note type="footnote"> * Numbers xiv. 24. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="263"/>
            polluted it, and having availed itself of the baths and purifica­ <lb/>
            tions of wisdom, it must inevitably look brilliant.</p>
          <p>XXII. But it happens to the arch-prophet to have many <lb/>
            names: for when he interprets and explains the oracles which <lb/>
            are delivered by God, lie is called Moses; and when he prays <lb/>
            for and blesses the people, he is called the man of God; * and <lb/>
            when Egypt is paying the penalty of its impious actions, he is <lb/>
            then denominated the god of him who is king of the country, <lb/>
            namely, of Pharaoh.t And why is all this ? Because to alter <lb/>
            a code of laws for the advantage of those who are to use them <lb/>
            is the part of a man who is always handling divine things, and <lb/>
            having them in his hands ; and who is called a lawgiver by the <lb/>
            all-knowing God, and who has received from him a great gift <lb/>
            -the interpretation of the sacred laws, and the spirit of pro­ <lb/>
            phecy in accordance with them. For the name Moses, being <lb/>
            translated, signifies " gain," and it also means handling, for the <lb/>
            reasons which I have already enumerated. But to pray and <lb/>
            to bless are not the duties of any ordinary man, but they belong <lb/>
            to one who has not admitted any connection with created <lb/>
            things, but who has devoted himself to God, the governor and <lb/>
            the father of all men. And any one must be content to whom <lb/>
            it has been allowed to use the privilege of blessing. And to be <lb/>
            able also to procure good for others belongs to a greater and <lb/>
            more perfect soul, and is the profession of one who is really <lb/>
            inspired by God, which he who has attained to may reasonably <lb/>
            be called God.</p>
          <p>But, also, this same person is God, inasmuch as he is wise, <lb/>
            and as on this account he rules over every foolish person, even <lb/>
            if such foolish person be established and strengthened by a <lb/>
            haughty sceptre, and be ever so proud on this account; for the <lb/>
            Ruler of the universe, even though some persons are about to <lb/>
            be punished for intolerable acts of wickedness, nevertheless is <lb/>
            willing to admit some intercessors to mediate on their behalf, <lb/>
            who, in imitation of the merciful power of the father, exercise <lb/>
            their power of punishment with more moderation and humanity ; <lb/>
            but to do good is the peculiar attribute of God.</p>
          <p>XXIII. Having now discussed at sufficient length the sub­ <lb/>
            ject of the change and alteration of names, we will turn to the <lb/>
            matters which come next in order in our proposed examination. <lb/>
            Immediately after the events which we have just mentioned, <note type="footnote"> * Deuteronomy XXXIII. 1. </note> <note type="footnote"> † Exodus vii. 1. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="264"/>
            came the birth of Isaac; for after God had given to his mother <lb/>
            the name of Sarrah instead of Sarah, he said to Abraham, " I <lb/>
            will give unto thee a son.”*. We must consider each of the <lb/>
            things here indicated particularly. Now he who is properly <lb/>
            said to give any thing whatever must by all means be giving <lb/>
            what is his own private property. And if this is true beyond <lb/>
            controversy, then it would follow that Isaac must not have been <lb/>
            a man, but a being synonymous with that most exquisite joy of <lb/>
            all pleasures, namely, laughter, the adopted son of God, who <lb/>
            gave him as a soother and cheerer to the most peace-loving <lb/>
            souls ; for it is absurd to suppose that there was one who was a <lb/>
            man, and another of whom bastard and illegitimate offspring were <lb/>
            descended: and, indeed, Moses calls the man of an intellect <lb/>
            devoted to virtue a god, when he says, " The Lord, seeing that <lb/>
            Leah was hated, opened her womb."t For having felt com­ <lb/>
            passion and pity for virtue as being hated by the race of man­ <lb/>
            kind, and for the soul which loves virtue, he makes the nature <lb/>
            which loves beauty barren, but opens the fountain of fecundity <lb/>
            and gives it a prosperous labour.</p>
          <p>But Tamar, when she became pregnant of divine seeds, and <lb/>
            did not know who it was who had sown them (for it is said <lb/>
            that at that time she " had covered her face," as Moses did <lb/>
            when he turned away, having a reverential fear of beholding <lb/>
            God), still when she saw the tokens and the evidences and <lb/>
            decided within herself that it was not a mortal man who gave <lb/>
            these things, cried out, “ To whomsoever these things belong, it <lb/>
            is by him that I am with child.”‡ Whose was the ring, or the <lb/>
            pledge, or the seal of the whole, or the archetypal appearance, <lb/>
            according to which all the things, though devoid of species and <lb/>
            of distinctive quality, were all stamped and marked ? And <lb/>
            whose again was the armlet, or the ornament; that is to say, <lb/>
            destiny, the link and analogy of all things which have an <lb/>
            indissoluble connection ? Whose, again, was the staff, the <lb/>
            thing of strong support, which wavers not, which is not moved ; <lb/>
            that is to say, admonition, correction, instruction ? Whose is <lb/>
            the sceptre, the kingly power ? does it not belong to God <lb/>
            alone? Therefore, the disposition inclined to confession, that <lb/>
            is to say, Judah, being pleased at her possessed and inspired <lb/>
            condition, speaks freely, saying, " She has spoken justly, <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xvii. ] 6. </note> <note type="footnote"> † Genesis xxix 31. </note> <note type="footnote"> ‡ Genesis xxxviii. 25. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="265"/>
            because I gave her in marriage to no mortal man ; ”* thinking <lb/>
            it an impious thing to pollute divine with profane things.</p>
          <p>XXIV. And wisdom, which, after the fashion of a mother, <lb/>
            has conceived and brought forth the self-taught race, points <lb/>
            out that it is God who is the sower of it; for, after the offspring <lb/>
            is brought forth, she speaks magnificently, saying, “The Lord <lb/>
            has caused me laughter ;”† an expression equivalent to, he <lb/>
            has fashioned, he has made, he has begotten Isaac, since Isaac <lb/>
            is the same with laughter. But it does not belong to every <lb/>
            one to hear this sound, since the evil of superstition is very <lb/>
            widely spread among us, and has overwhelmed many unmanly <lb/>
            and ignoble souls ; on which account she adds, " For whoever <lb/>
            hears this will not rejoice with me." As if those persons were <lb/>
            very few whose ears are opened and pricked up so as to be <lb/>
            inclined to the reception of these sacred words, which teach <lb/>
            that it is the peculiar employment of the only God to sow and <lb/>
            to beget what is good; to which words all other persons are <lb/>
            deaf.</p>
          <p>And I know that this illustrious oracle was formerly delivered <lb/>
            from the mouth of the prophet, " Thy fruit has been found <lb/>
            from me : who is wise and will understand these things ? who is <lb/>
            prudent and will know them?”‡ But I have observed, and <lb/>
            comprehended, and admired him who causes to resound, and <lb/>
            who himself, invisible as he is, does in an invisible manner <lb/>
            strike the organ of the voice; being amazed also at the same <lb/>
            time at what was uttered. For if there be any good thing <lb/>
            among existing things, that, or I should rather say the whole <lb/>
            heaven and the whole world, if one must tell the truth, is the <lb/>
            fruit of God; being preserved upon his eternal and ever­ <lb/>
            flourishing nature as upon a tree. But it belongs to wise and <lb/>
            understanding men to understand and to confess such things <lb/>
            as these, and not to the ignorant.</p>
          <p>XXV. We have now then explained what is meant by the <lb/>
            words, “I will give unto thee." We must now explain the <lb/>
            words, “out of her." Some now have understood them as <lb/>
            meaning that which exists out of her, thinking that it has been <lb/>
            most correctly decided by right reason that the soul never dis­ <lb/>
            plays any peculiar beauty of its own, but only such as comes to <lb/>
            it from without, in accordance with the greatness of the good <lb/>
            will of God who showers his graces upon it. But others <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xxxviii. 26. </note> <note type="footnote"> † Genesis xxi. 6. </note> <note type="footnote">‡ Hosea xiv 9. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="266"/>
            understand these words to mean instant rapidity; for that the <lb/>
            words (i; <foreign xml:lang="grc">αυτη̃ς</foreign>, which we have translated) " out of her," are <lb/>
            here equivalent to, " at once, immediately, without any delay, <lb/>
            without hesitation." And it is in this way that the gifts of <lb/>
            God usually come to men, outstripping the differences of time.</p>
          <p>There is a third class of persons who say, that virtue is the <lb/>
            mother of all created good, without having received the seed <lb/>
            of it from any mortal man ; and to those who ask, whether she <lb/>
            who is barren has an offspring (for the holy scriptures, which <lb/>
            some time ago represented Sarrah as barren, now confess that <lb/>
            she will become a mother) ; this answer must be given, that a <lb/>
            woman who is barren cannot, in the course of nature, bring <lb/>
            forth an offspring, just as a blind man cannot see, nor a deaf <lb/>
            man hear; but that the soul, which is barren of bad things, <lb/>
            and which is unproductive of immoderate license of the <lb/>
            passions and vices, is alone very nearly attaining to a happy <lb/>
            delivery, bringing forward objects worthy of love, namely, the <lb/>
            number seven, according to the hymn which is sung by Grace, <lb/>
            that is, by Hannah, who says, " she who was barren hath <lb/>
            borne seven, and she who bad many children has become <lb/>
            weak and what she means by, “She who had many chil <lb/>
            dren," is the mind, which being pregnant of mixed and pro­ <lb/>
            miscuous reasonings, from all quarters confused together, by <lb/>
            reason of the multitudes which crowd around her, and of the <lb/>
            disorder which they cause, brings forth incurable evils; and <lb/>
            by “she who was barren," she means that mind which had <lb/>
            never received any mortal seed, as if it were productive of off­ <lb/>
            spring, but has avoided and shunned all association and all <lb/>
            connection with the wicked, and clings to the seventh, and to <lb/>
            the most peaceful numbers in accordance with it, for it deserves <lb/>
            to be pregnant of it, and to be called its mother.</p>
          <p>XXVI. This then is the meaning of the words, " out of <lb/>
            her." We must now consider the third point, namely, what <lb/>
            that is which is called her son. In the first place, then, there <lb/>
            is this worthy of our admiration, that God does not say <lb/>
            that he will give her many children, but that he will give her <lb/>
            one only. And why is this ? Because it is the nature of <lb/>
            what is good to be investigated, not so much with respect to <lb/>
            its number or magnitude, as with respect to its power; for <lb/>
            musical precepts, to take them for an instance, or rules of <note type="footnote"> it 1 Samuel ii. 5. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="267"/>
            grammar, or of geometry, or of justice, or of wisdom, or of <lb/>
            manly courage, or of temperance, are very numerous indeed ; <lb/>
            but the science itself of music, or grammar, or geometry, and <lb/>
            still more the virtue of justice, or temperance, or wisdom, or <lb/>
            manly courage, is only one thing, the loftiest perfection, in no <lb/>
            respect differing from the archetypal model, after which all <lb/>
            those numerous and countless precepts were formed.</p>
          <p>And this is why he only says that he will give her one son. <lb/>
            And now he has called it a son, not speaking carelessly or in­ <lb/>
            considerately, but for the sake of showing that it is not a <lb/>
            foreign, nor a supposititious, nor an adopted, nor an illegiti­ <lb/>
            mate child, but a legitimate child, a proper citizen, inasmuch <lb/>
            as a foreign child cannot be the offspring of a truly citizen <lb/>
            soul, for the Greek word <foreign xml:lang="grc">τέϰνον</foreign> (son), is derived from <foreign xml:lang="grc">τόϰος</foreign> <lb/>
            (bringing forth), by way of showing the kindred by which chil­ <lb/>
            dren are, by nature, united to their parents.</p>
          <p>XXVII. And, says God, " I will bless her, and she shall be <lb/>
            a mother of nations ;"* because, not only is generic virtue di­ <lb/>
            vided into its proximate species, and into individuals subordi­ <lb/>
            nate to the species, as if into nations; but also because, as <lb/>
            there are nations of living animals, so in a manner are <lb/>
            . there nations of things, to which virtue is a very great advan­ <lb/>
            tage ; for all things which are devoid and destitute of wisdom <lb/>
            are mischievous, just as all places upon which the sun does <lb/>
            not shine are of necessity dark; for it is by virtue that a <lb/>
            farmer is able to pay better attention to his crops, and by vir­ <lb/>
            tue that a charioteer drives his chariot in the horse-races so as <lb/>
            to avoid falling; and by virtue too, that a pilot and a steers­ <lb/>
            man guides his vessel in its voyage. Virtue again has caused <lb/>
            houses, and cities, and countries to be inhabited in a better <lb/>
            manner, making men competent to manage houses and cities, <lb/>
            and fit to associate with one another. Virtue also has intro­ <lb/>
            duced most excellent laws, and has sown the seeds of peace <lb/>
            everywhere; since, from the contrary habit, things of a con­ <lb/>
            trary character do naturally arise—war, lawlessness, bad con­ <lb/>
            stitutions, confusion, unsuccessful voyages, overthrows, that <lb/>
            which, in science, is the most grievous of all diseases, namely, <lb/>
            cunning, from which, instead of art, all kinds of evil artifice <lb/>
            has flowed. Very necessarily, therefore, will virtue be divided <lb/>
            among all nations, which are large and collected systems of <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xvii. 16. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="268"/>
            living beings and things taken together, for the advantage of <lb/>
            those who receive her.</p>
          <p>XXVIII. Immediately afterwards it is said, " And kings <lb/>
            of the nations shall be born of her." For those with whom <lb/>
            she is pregnant and whom she brings forth are all rulers; not <lb/>
            because they have been elected as such for a short period by <lb/>
            lot, which is an uncertain thing, or by the show of hands of <lb/>
            men who are for the most part bribed, but because they have <lb/>
            been destined and appointed so for everlasting by nature herself. <lb/>
            And these are not my words only, but those of the most holy <lb/>
            scriptures, in which certain persons are introduced as saying to <lb/>
            Abraham, " Thou art a king from God among us not out <lb/>
            of consideration for his resources (for what resources could a <lb/>
            man have who was an emigrant and who had no city to inhabit, <lb/>
            but who was wandering over a great extent of impassable <lb/>
            country ?), but because they saw that he had a royal disposition <lb/>
            in his mind, so that they confessed, in the words of Moses, that <lb/>
            he was the only wise king.</p>
          <p>For in real truth the wise man is the king of those who are <lb/>
            foolish, since he knows what he ought and what he ought not <lb/>
            to do ; and the temperate man is the king of the intemperate, <lb/>
            as he has attained to no careless or inaccurate knowledge of . <lb/>
            what relates to choice and avoidance. Also the brave man is <lb/>
            king over the cowardly, inasmuch as he has thoroughly learnt <lb/>
            what he ought to endure and what he ought not. So too the <lb/>
            just man is king of the unjust, as he is possessed of the know­ <lb/>
            ledge of undeviating equality as to what is to be distributed. <lb/>
            And the holy man is king over the unholy, as he is possessed <lb/>
            with the most just and excellent notions of God.</p>
          <p>XXIX. It was natural then for the mind, being puffed up <lb/>
            by these promises, to be elated and raised to an undue height <lb/>
            in its own estimation ; and accordingly, by way of producing <lb/>
            conviction in us, who were accustomed to hold up our heads at <lb/>
            the slightest trifles, " it falls down and immediately laughs <lb/>
            the laughter of the soul," looking mournful as to its face, but <lb/>
            smiling in its mind a great and unmixed joy having entered <lb/>
            into it: and both these feelings, namely, to laugh and also to <lb/>
            fall, do at the same time occur to a wise man who inherits <lb/>
            good things beyond his expectation ; the one being his fate, <lb/>
            as a proof that he is not over-proud because of his thorough <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xxiii. 6. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="269"/>
            knowledge of his mortal nothingness; and the other, by way <lb/>
            of a confirmation of his piety on account of his looking upon <lb/>
            God as the sole cause of all graces and of all good things.</p>
          <p>Let, then, the creature fall down and wear a melancholy <lb/>
            countenance very naturally ; for it has no stability in its own <lb/>
            nature, and as far as that goes is easily dissolved ; but let it <lb/>
            be raised up again by God, and laugh, for he alone is the sup­ <lb/>
            port and joy of it.</p>
          <p>And here any one may reasonably express a doubt how it is <lb/>
            possible for any one to laugh when laughter had not as yet <lb/>
            come among one branch of the creation ; for Isaac is laughter, <lb/>
            who, according to the account under our consideration at <lb/>
            present, was not yet born. For just as it is impossible to see <lb/>
            without eyes, or to hear without ears, or to smell without nos­ <lb/>
            trils, or to exert any other of the external senses without the <lb/>
            organs adapted to each respectively, or to comprehend without <lb/>
            the reason, so also it is not likely that a person can have <lb/>
            laughed, if laughter had not as yet been made. What, then, <lb/>
            are we to say? Nature foreshows many of the things which <lb/>
            are hereafter to happen by certain symbols. Do you not see <lb/>
            how the young bird, before it commits itself to the air, is fond <lb/>
            of fluttering its wings and shaking its pinions, giving a <lb/>
            previous happy indication of its hope that it will be able to <lb/>
            fly ? And have you never seen a lamb, or a kid, or an ox, <lb/>
            while still- young, and before his horns are as yet grown and <lb/>
            noticed, if by chance any one irritates him, how he opposes <lb/>
            him, and moves forward to defend himself with those parts in <lb/>
            which nature has planted his arms for defence ? And in the <lb/>
            battles which take place with wild beasts, the bulls do not at <lb/>
            once gore the adversaries who are opposed to them, but stand­ <lb/>
            ing well apart, and relaxing their neck in a moderate degree <lb/>
            and bending their heads on one side, and looking fierce, as it <lb/>
            were, they then, after a truce, rush on with the determination <lb/>
            of persevering in the contest. And this sort of conduct those <lb/>
            who are in the habit of inventing new words call “sparring," <lb/>
            being a sort of sham attack before the real one.</p>
          <p>XXX. And the soul is subject to many things of much the <lb/>
            same kind. For when something good is hoped for it rejoices <lb/>
            beforehand, so that in a manner it rejoices before its joy, and <lb/>
            is delighted before its delight. And one may also compare <lb/>
            this to what happens with respect to plants; for they, too, <lb/>
             <pb n="270"/>
            when they are about to bear fruit, bud beforehand and flower <lb/>
            previously, and are green previously.</p>
          <p>Look at the cultivated vine, how marvellously it is furnished <lb/>
            by nature with young shoots, and tendrils, and suckers, and <lb/>
            leaves redolent of wine, which, though they utter no voice, do <lb/>
            nevertheless indicate the joy of the tree at the coming fruit. <lb/>
            And the day also laughs in anticipation of the early dawn. <lb/>
            when the sun is about to rise; for one ray is a messenger of <lb/>
            another, and one beam of light, as the forerunner of another <lb/>
            though more obscure, is still a herald of that which shall be <lb/>
            brighter.</p>
          <p>Therefore, joy accompanies a good when it is already <lb/>
            arrived, and hope while it is expected. For we rejoice when <lb/>
            it is come, and we hope while it is coming; just as is the case <lb/>
            also with the contrary feelings; for the presence of evil brings <lb/>
            us grief, and the expectation of evil generates fear, and fear <lb/>
            is nothing more than grief before grief, as hope is joy before <lb/>
            joy. For the same relation that, I imagine, fear bears to grief, <lb/>
            that same does hope bear to joy. And the external senses <lb/>
            afford very manifest proofs of what has now been said; for <lb/>
            smell, sitting as it were in front of taste, pronounces judgment <lb/>
            beforehand on almost every thing which is eaten and drunk; <lb/>
            from which fact some persons have very felicitously named it <lb/>
            the foretaster, having a regard to its employment. And so <lb/>
            hope is by nature adapted to have as it were a foretaste of the <lb/>
            coming good: and to represent it to the soul, which is to have <lb/>
            a firm possession of it.</p>
          <p>Moreover, when any one who is engaged in a journey is <lb/>
            hungry or thirsty, if he on a sudden sees a fountain or all <lb/>
            kinds of trees weighed down with eatable fruits, he is at once <lb/>
            filled with a hope of enjoyment, not only before he has either <lb/>
            eaten or drunk, but before he has either come near them or <lb/>
            gathered of them. And do we then think that we are able to <lb/>
            feast on the nourishment of the body before we receive it, but <lb/>
            that the food of the mind is not able to render us cheerful <lb/>
            beforehand, even when we are on the very point of feasting on <lb/>
            it?</p>
          <p>XXXI. He laughed then very naturally, even though <lb/>
            laughter did not as yet appear to have been scattered among <lb/>
            the human race: and not only did he laugh but the woman <lb/>
            also laughed; for it is said presently, "And Sarrah laughed in <lb/>
             <pb n="271"/>
            herself, saying, There has never up to the present time <lb/>
            come any good unto me of its own accord without care on <lb/>
            my part; but he who has promised is my Lord, and is older <lb/>
            than all creation, and him I must of necessity believe.” And <lb/>
            at the same time it also teaches us that virtue is naturally a <lb/>
            thing to be rejoiced at, and that he who possesses it is at all <lb/>
            times rejoiced; and, on the contrary, that vice is a painful <lb/>
            thing, and that he who possesses that is most miserable.</p>
          <p>And do we even now marvel at those philosophers who <lb/>
            affirm that virtue consists in apathy? For, behold, Moses is <lb/>
            found to be the leader of this wise doctrine, as he represents <lb/>
            the good man as rejoicing and laughing. And in other pas­ <lb/>
            sages he not only speaks of him in that way, but also of all <lb/>
            those who come to the same place with him; for lie says, " And <lb/>
            when he seeth thee he will rejoice in himself;"* as if the bare <lb/>
            sight of a good man were by itself sufficient to fill the mind <lb/>
            with cheerfulness while the soul would cast off its most fearful <lb/>
            burden, sorrow.</p>
          <p>But it is not allowed to every wicked man to rejoice, as it is <lb/>
            said in the predictions of the prophet, " There is no rejoicing <lb/>
            for the wicked, says God."t For this is truly a divine saying <lb/>
            and oracle, that the life of every wicked man is melancholy, <lb/>
            and sad, and full of unhappiness, even if with his face he pre­ <lb/>
            tends to feel happiness ; for I should not say that the Egyp­ <lb/>
            tians rejoiced in reality when they heard that the brethren of <lb/>
            Joseph were come, but that they only feigned joy, putting on a <lb/>
            false appearance like hypocrites ; for no convictor, when stand­ <lb/>
            ing by and pressing upon a foolish man is a pleasure to him, <lb/>
            just as no physician is to an intemperate man who is sick; for <lb/>
            labour attends on what is useful, and laziness on what is hurt­ <lb/>
            ful. And those who prefer laziness to labour are very naturally <lb/>
            hated by those who advise them to a course which will be use­ <lb/>
            ful and laborious.</p>
          <p>When, therefore, you hear that “Pharaoh and all his <lb/>
            servants rejoiced on account of the arrival of Joseph's <lb/>
            brethren,”‡ do not think that they rejoiced in reality, unless <lb/>
            perhaps in this sense, that they expected that he would become <lb/>
            changed from the good things of the soul in which he had <lb/>
            been brought up, and would come over to the profitless appe­ <note type="footnote"> * Exodus iv. 14. </note> <note type="footnote"> † Isaiah xlviii. 22. </note> <note type="footnote"> ‡ Genesis xlv. 16. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="272"/>
            tites of the body, having adulterated the ancient and hereditary <lb/>
            coinage of that virtue which was akin to him.</p>
          <p>XXXII. The mind, then, which is devoted to pleasure, <lb/>
            having entertained these hopes, does not think that it is suffi­ <lb/>
            cient to attract the younger men, and those who are as yet <lb/>
            only attending the schools of temperance, by its allurements; <lb/>
            bnt it looks upon it as a terrible thing, if it cannot also bring <lb/>
            over the elder reasoning, the more impetuous passions of which <lb/>
            have now passed their prime; for in a subsequent passage <lb/>
            Joseph says to them, proposing injuries to them as though they <lb/>
            were benefits, " Now, therefore, bringing with you your father <lb/>
            and all your possessions, come hither to me;”* speaking in <lb/>
            this way of Egypt and of that terrible king who drags back all <lb/>
            our paternal inheritance and the good things which really <lb/>
            belong to us and which have advanced beyond the body (for by <lb/>
            nature they are free), endeavouring by force to surrender <lb/>
            them to a very bitter prison, having, as the holy scripture tells <lb/>
            us, "appointed as guardian of the prison Pentaphres, the <lb/>
            eunuch and chief cook,"t who was a man in great want of all <lb/>
            that is good, and who had been deprived of the generative <lb/>
            parts of the soul; and who was also unable to sow and to <lb/>
            plant any of those things which bear upon instruction ; but who <lb/>
            like a cook slew the living animals, and cut them up and <lb/>
            divided them in different portions limb by limb, and who <lb/>
            wallowed about in dead and lifeless bodies and things equally, <lb/>
            and who, by his superfluous preparations and refinements, <lb/>
            excited and stirred up the appetites of the profitless passions, <lb/>
            which it was natural to expect that those who were able to <lb/>
            tame them should mollify. And he also says, “I will give <lb/>
            unto you of all the good things of Egypt, and you shall eat of <lb/>
            the marrow of the earth." ‡</p>
          <p>But we will say unto him, We who keep our eyes fixed on <lb/>
            the good things of the soul do not desire those of the body. <lb/>
            For that most delicious desire of the former things, when once <lb/>
            implanted in the mind, is well calculated to engender a forget­ <lb/>
            fulness of all those things which are dear to the flesh</p>
          <p>XXXIII. Something like this, then, is the falsely named <lb/>
            joy of the foolish. But the true joy has already been described, <lb/>
            which is adapted only to the virtuous, " Therefore, falling <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xlv. 18. </note> <note type="footnote"> † Genesis xxxix. 1. </note> <note type="footnote">‡ Genesis xlv. 18. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="273"/>
            down, he laughed.”* Not falling from God, but from himself; <lb/>
            for he stood near the unchangeable God, but he fell from his <lb/>
            own vain opinion. On which account that pride which was wise <lb/>
            in its own conceit, having been thrown down, and the feeling <lb/>
            which is devoted to God having been raised in its place, and <lb/>
            being established around the only unalterable being, he, imme­ <lb/>
            diately laughing, said in his mind, " Shall a child be born to <lb/>
            one who is a hundred years old, and shall Sarrah, who is ninety <lb/>
            years old, have a child?" Do not fancy, my good friend, <lb/>
            that that word, "he said" not with his mouth but "in his <lb/>
            mind,”† has been added for no especial use ; on the contrary, it <lb/>
            is inserted with great accuracy and propriety. Why so? <lb/>
            Because it. seems by his saying, " Shall a child be born to him <lb/>
            who is a hundred years old ?” that he had a doubt about the <lb/>
            birth of Isaac, in which he was previously stated to believe ; as <lb/>
            what was predicted a little before showed, speaking thus, <lb/>
            " This child shall not be thy heir, but he who shall come out <lb/>
            of thee;" and immediately afterward he says, "Abraham <lb/>
            believed in the Lord, and it was counted to him for right­ <lb/>
            eousness."</p>
          <p>Since then it was not consistent for one who had already <lb/>
            believed to doubt, he has represented the doubt as of no long <lb/>
            continuance, extending only as far as the mouth and the <lb/>
            tongue, and stopping there at the mind which is endowed with <lb/>
            such celerity of motion; for, says the scripture, " be said in his <lb/>
            mind," which nothing, and no person ever so celebrated for <lb/>
            swiftness of foot, could ever be able to outstrip, since it out­ <lb/>
            runs even all the winged natures; on which account the most <lb/>
            illustrious of all the Greek poets appears to me to have said :— <lb/>
            " Swift as a winged bird or fleeter thought."‡ <lb/>
            Showing by these words the exceeding speed of its promptitude, <lb/>
            placing the thought after the winged bird as a sort of climax; <lb/>
            for the mind advances at the same moment to very many <lb/>
            things and bodies, hurrying on with indescribable impetuosity, <lb/>
            and without a moment's lapse of time it speeds at once to the <lb/>
            borders of both earth and sea, bringing together and dividing <lb/>
            infinite magnitudes by a single word; and at the same time it <lb/>
            soars to such a height above the earth, that it penetrates <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xvii. 17. </note><note type="footnote"> t Homer. Odyssey vii. 171. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Genesis xvii. 20. </note> <note type="footnote"> VOL. II. </note> <note type="footnote"> T </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="274"/>
            through the air and reaches even the æther, and scarcely <lb/>
            stops at the very furthest circle of the fixed stars.</p>
          <p>For the fervid and glowing heat of that region does not <lb/>
            suffer it to rest tranquil; on which account, overleaping many <lb/>
            things, it is borne far beyond every boundary perceptible by <lb/>
            the outward senses, to that which is compounded of ideas and <lb/>
            appearances by the law of kindred. On which account in the <lb/>
            good man there is a slight change, indivisible, unapportionable, <lb/>
            not perceptible by the outward senses, but only by the intellect, <lb/>
            and being in a manner independent of them.</p>
          <p>XXXIV. But, perhaps, some one may say, What then ? is he <lb/>
            who has once believed bound never to admit the slightest <lb/>
            trace, or shadow, or moment of incredulity at all? But this <lb/>
            man appears to me to have nothing else in his mind except an <lb/>
            idea of proving the creature uncreated, and the mortal immor­ <lb/>
            tal, and the corruptible incorruptible, and man, if it be lawful <lb/>
            to say so, God. For lie says that the belief which man has <lb/>
            once conceived ought to be so firm as in no respect to differ <lb/>
            from that which is entertained of the truly living God and <lb/>
            which is complete in every part; for Moses, in his greater <lb/>
            hymn, says, " God is faithful, and there is no unrighteousness <lb/>
            in him."* And it is great folly to fancy that the soul of <lb/>
            man is able to contain the virtues of God, which never vary <lb/>
            and which are established on the most solid footing; for it is <lb/>
            sufficient, and one must be content to have been able to acquire <lb/>
            the images of them, though they are inferior to the archetypal <lb/>
            patterns by many and large numbers. And is not this reason­ <lb/>
            able ? for it follows of necessity that the virtues of God must <lb/>
            be pure and unmixed, since God is not a compound being, <lb/>
            inasmuch as he is a single nature; on the other hand, the <lb/>
            virtues of men must be mixed with some alloy, since we our­ <lb/>
            selves are compounds, the divine and human nature being <lb/>
            combined in us, and adapted together according to the princi­ <lb/>
            ples of perfect music; and that which is composed of many <lb/>
            separate things has a natural attraction to each of its parts. <lb/>
            But he is happy to whom it has happened that for the greater <lb/>
            portion of his life he has inclined towards the more excellent <lb/>
            and more divine part; for that he should have done so all his <lb/>
            life is impossible, since at times the mortal weight which is <lb/>
            opposed to him has preponderated in the opposite scale, and <note type="footnote"> * Deuteronomy xxxii. 4. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="275"/>
            impending over his mind, has kept watch for the opportunities <lb/>
            of coming upon his reason at an unfavourable time, so as to <lb/>
            drag it back again.</p>
          <p>XXXV. Abraham therefore believed in God; but he <lb/>
            believed as a man; that you may be aware of the peculiar <lb/>
            attribute of mortals, and may learn that his fall did not <lb/>
            happen to him in any other way than in consequence of the <lb/>
            ordinances of nature. And if it was of short duration and <lb/>
            only momentary, it is a thing to be thankful for: for many <lb/>
            other men have been so overturned by the violence and impe­ <lb/>
            tuosity of error, and by its irresistible force, that they have <lb/>
            been utterly destroyed for ever. For know, my good man, that, <lb/>
            according to the most holy Moses, virtue is not perfect in the <lb/>
            human body, but it suffers something like torpor, and is often <lb/>
            ever so little lame. For says the scripture, " The broader <lb/>
            part of his thigh became torpid, on which he was lame."* And <lb/>
            perhaps some man of an over-confident disposition may come <lb/>
            forward and say that this is not the language of one who dis­ <lb/>
            believes, but of one praying, so that if that most excellent of <lb/>
            all the happy feelings were about to be produced, it would not <lb/>
            be brought forth according to any other number than that of <lb/>
            ninety years, that so the perfect good might arrive at its pro­ <lb/>
            duction according to perfect numbers.</p>
          <p>But the aforesaid numbers are perfect, and especially ac­ <lb/>
            cording to the sacred scriptures. And let us consider each of <lb/>
            them : now first of all there is the son of the just Noah and <lb/>
            the ancestor of the seeing race, and he is said to have been a <lb/>
            hundred years old when he begot Arphaxad,† and the meaning <lb/>
            of the name Arphaxad is, "he disturbed sorrow." At all events <lb/>
            it is a good thing that the offspring of the soul should confuse, <lb/>
            and disorder, and destroy that miserable thing iniquity, so full <lb/>
            of evils.</p>
          <p>But Abraham also planted a field,‡ using the ratio of an <lb/>
            hundred for the measurement of the ground: and Isaac found <lb/>
            some barley yielding a hundred fold.§ And Moses also made <lb/>
            the vestibule of the sacred tabernacle in a hundred arches,|| <lb/>
            measuring out the distance towards the east and towards the <lb/>
            west. Moreover the ratio of a hundred is the first fruit of <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xxxii. 25. </note><note type="footnote">‡ Genesis xxi. 33. </note><note type="footnote"> || Exodus xxvii. 9. </note> <note type="footnote"> † Genesis xi. 10. </note><note type="footnote"> § Genesis xxvi. 12. </note> <note type="footnote"> T 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="276"/>
            the first fruit which the Levites assign to those who are conse­ <lb/>
            crated to the priesthood ; * for after they have taken the <lb/>
            tenths from the nation they are enjoined to give unto the <lb/>
            priests a sacred tenth of the whole share, as if from their own <lb/>
            possessions. And if a person were to consider, he might find <lb/>
            many other instances to the praise of the aforesaid number <lb/>
            brought forward in the law of Moses, but for the present what <lb/>
            have been enumerated are sufficient. But if from the hundred <lb/>
            you set aside the tenth part as a sacred first fruit to God who <lb/>
            produces, and increases, and brings to perfection the fruit of <lb/>
            the soul-for how can it be anything but perfect, inasmuch <lb/>
            as it is on the confines between the first and the tenth, in the <lb/>
            same manner in which the Holy of Holies is separated by the <lb/>
            veil in the middle . .† by which those things which are of <lb/>
            the same genus are divided according to the differences in <lb/>
            species ?</p>
          <p>XXXVI. Therefore the good man was speaking and saying <lb/>
            things which were really good in his mind. But the bad man <lb/>
            at times interprets good things in a very excellent manner, but <lb/>
            nevertheless does shameful things in a most shameful one, as <lb/>
            Shechem dues who is the offspring of folly. For he is the son <lb/>
            of Hamon his father, and the name Hamon, being trranslated, <lb/>
            means " an ass," but the name Shechem means “a shoulder" <lb/>
            when interpreted, the symbol of labour. But that labour of <lb/>
            which folly is the parent is miserable and full of suffering, as, <lb/>
            on the other hand, that labour is useful to which prudence is <lb/>
            related. Accordingly the holy scriptures tell us that, <lb/>
            " Shechem spake according to the mind of the virgin, having <lb/>
            first humbled lier.”‡ Is it not said then, with great purpose <lb/>
            and accuracy, that he spake according to the mind of the dam­ <lb/>
            sel, for the purpose of showing distinctly that he acted in a <lb/>
            contrary manner to that in which he spoke? For Dinah <lb/>
            means incorruptible judgment: justice the attribute seated <lb/>
            by God, the everlasting virgin; for the name Dinah, being <lb/>
            interpreted, means either thing, judgment or justice.</p>
          <p>Fools, then, laying violent hands upon and attempting to <lb/>
            defile her, by means of their daily designs and practices, by <lb/>
            their plausibility of speech escape conviction. Therefore <note type="footnote"> * Numbers xviii 28. </note><note type="footnote">‡ Genesis xxxiv. 3. </note> <note type="footnote"> † There is a hiatus in the text here. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="277"/>
            they must either act in a manner consistent with the lan­ <lb/>
            guage that they hold, or else they must hold their tongues <lb/>
            while committing iniquity. For it is said, " Silence is one half <lb/>
            of evil :" as Moses says when rebuking the man who accounted <lb/>
            the creature worthy of the principal honour, and the immortal <lb/>
            God worthy only of the second place, " Thou hast sinued, be <lb/>
            silent." For to use bombastic language, and to boast of one's <lb/>
            evil deeds, is a double sin : and men in general are very prone <lb/>
            to this; for they are constantly saying what is pleasing to <lb/>
            the ever-virgin virtue, and such things as are just: but they <lb/>
            never omit any opportunity of insulting and violating her when <lb/>
            they are able.</p>
          <p>For what city is there which is not full of those who are <lb/>
            continually celebrating the praises of virtue ?—men who weary <lb/>
            the ears of those who hear them by everlastingly dwelling on <lb/>
            such subjects as these ; wisdom is a necessary good ; folly is <lb/>
            pernicious ; temperance is desirable ; intemperance is hateful; <lb/>
            courage is a thing proper to be cultivated ; cowardice must be <lb/>
            avoided ; justice is advantageous ; injustice is disadvantageous; <lb/>
            holiness is honourable; unholiness is shameful; piety towards <lb/>
            the gods is praiseworthy ; impiety is blameable ; that which is <lb/>
            most akin to the nature of man is to design, and to act, and to <lb/>
            speak virtuously; that which is most alien from his nature <lb/>
            is to do the contrary of all these things.</p>
          <p>By continually stringing together these and similar aphorisms <lb/>
            they deceive the courts of justice, and the council cham­ <lb/>
            bers, and the theatres, and every assembly and company <lb/>
            which they meet; as men who put beautiful masks on ugly <lb/>
            faces, with the intention of not being discovered by those who <lb/>
            see them. But it is of no use ; for some persons will come <lb/>
            endowed with great vigour, and occupied with a real zeal and <lb/>
            admiration for virtue, and who will strip them of all their <lb/>
            coverings, and disguises, and appendages which they had <lb/>
            woven round themselves by the evil artifice of plausible <lb/>
            speeches, and will display their soul naked by itself as it <lb/>
            really is, and will make themselves acquainted with the secret <lb/>
            things of their nature which are hidden as it were in recesses. <lb/>
            And then having brought to light all its shame and all the <lb/>
            reproaches to which it is liable, they will display them in <lb/>
            broad daylight to every one, and show what sort of thing it is, <lb/>
            how disgraceful and ridiculous, and what a spurious kind of <lb/>
             <pb n="278"/>
            beauty it has disguised itself with by means of its appendages <lb/>
            and coverings.</p>
          <p>And those who are prepared to avenge themselves on such <lb/>
            profane and impure dispositions are Simeon and Levi,* two <lb/>
            indeed in number, but only one in mind ; on which account, in <lb/>
            his blessings of his sons, their father numbers them together <lb/>
            under one classification, on account of the harmonious charac­ <lb/>
            ter of their unanimity and of their violence in one and the <lb/>
            same direction. But Moses does not make any mention of <lb/>
            them afterwards as a pair, but classes the whole tribe of Simeon <lb/>
            under that of Levi, combining together two essences, of which <lb/>
            he made one impressed as it were with one idea and appear­ <lb/>
            ance, uniting hearing to doing.</p>
          <p>XXXVII. When, therefore, the virtuous man knew that <lb/>
            the promise was uttering things full of reverence and prudent <lb/>
            caution, according to his own mind, he admitted both these <lb/>
            feelings into his breast, namely, faith in God, and incredulity <lb/>
            as to the creature. Very naturally therefore he says, using the <lb/>
            language of entreaty, “Would that this Ishmael might live <lb/>
            before thee,”† using each word of those which he utters here <lb/>
            with deliberate propriety, namely, the “this," the “might <lb/>
            live," the " before thee." For it is no small number of per­ <lb/>
            sons who have been deceived by the similarity of the names of <lb/>
            different things, and we had better examine here what I am <lb/>
            saying.</p>
          <p>The name Ishmael, being interpreted, means " the hearing <lb/>
            of God," but some men listen to the divine doctrines to their <lb/>
            benefit, and others listen to both his admonitions and to those <lb/>
            of others only to their destruction. Do you not recollect the <lb/>
            case of the soothsayer Balaam?‡ He is represented as hear­ <lb/>
            ing the oracles of God, and as having received knowledge from <lb/>
            the Most High, but what advantage did he reap from such <lb/>
            hearing, and what good accrued to him from such knowledge ? <lb/>
            In his intention he endeavoured to injure the most excellent <lb/>
            eye of the soul, which alone has received such instruction as to <lb/>
            be able to behold God, but he was unable to do so by reason of <lb/>
            the invincible power of the Saviour; therefore, being over­ <lb/>
            thrown by his own insane wickedness, and having received <lb/>
            many wounds, he perished amid the heaps of wounded, § be­ <note type="footnote"> * Deuteronomy xxxiii. G. </note><note type="footnote">‡ Numbers xxiv. 17. </note> <note type="footnote"> † Genesis xvii. 18. </note><note type="footnote"> § Numbers xxxi 8. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="279"/>
            cause he had stamped beforehand the divinely inspired pro­ <lb/>
            phecies with the sophistry of the soothsayers.</p>
          <p>Very righteously, therefore, does the good man pray that <lb/>
            this his only son, Ishmael, may he sound in mind and health, <lb/>
            because of those persons who do not listen in a sincere spirit <lb/>
            to the sacred admonitions, whom Moses has expressly forbidden <lb/>
            to come into the assembly of the Ruler of the universe, for <lb/>
            those men are broken as to the generative parts of their <lb/>
            minds, or are even rendered completely impotent in that <lb/>
            respect, who magnify their own minds, and their external <lb/>
            sense, as the only causes of all the events which take place <lb/>
            among men; and there are others who are lovers of a system <lb/>
            of polytheism, and who honour the company which is devoted <lb/>
            to the service of many gods, being the sons of a harlot, having <lb/>
            no knowledge of the one husband and father of the virtue- <lb/>
            loving soul, namely, God; and are not all these men very pro­ <lb/>
            perly driven away and banished from the assembly of God ? <lb/>
            They appear to me very much to resemble those parents who <lb/>
            accuse their sons of intemperance in wine, for they say, <lb/>
            " This our son is disobedient.”* indicating, by the addition of <lb/>
            the word “this," that they have other sons likewise who are <lb/>
            temperate and self-denying, and who obey the injunctions of <lb/>
            right reason and instruction; for these are the most genuine <lb/>
            parents, by whom it is a most disgraceful thing to be accused, <lb/>
            and a most glorious thing to be praised.</p>
          <p>Then as to the words, " This is Aaron and Moses, whom <lb/>
            God directed to lead the children of Israel out of Egypt,”† <lb/>
            and the expression, " These are they who conversed with <lb/>
            Pharaoh the king." Let us not think that they are used su­ <lb/>
            perfluously, or that they do not convey some intimations <lb/>
            beyond the mere open meaning of the words; for since Moses <lb/>
            is the purest mind, and Aaron is his speech, and moreover, <lb/>
            since the mind has been taught to think of divine things in a <lb/>
            divine manner, and since the speech has learnt to interpret <lb/>
            holy things in holy language, the sophists imitating them, and <lb/>
            adulterating the genuine coinage, say, that they also conceive <lb/>
            rightly, and speak in a praiseworthy manner about what is <lb/>
            most excellent.</p>
          <p>In order, therefore, that we may not be deceived by a placing <lb/>
            of the base money in juxtaposition with the good, by reason of <note type="footnote"> * Deuteronomy iri. 20. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Exodus vi. 26. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="280"/>
            the similitude of the impression, he has given us a test by <lb/>
            which they may be distinguished. What then is the test? To <lb/>
            bring out of the region of the body the mind, endowed with <lb/>
            the power of seeing, fond of contemplation and philosophical; <lb/>
            for he who can do this is this same Moses; and he who is un­ <lb/>
            able really to do so, but who is only said to be able, and who <lb/>
            makes professions with infinite pomp and magnitude of lan­ <lb/>
            guage, is laughed at.</p>
          <p>But he prays that Ishmael may live, not meaning to refer <lb/>
            to the life in conjunction with the body, but he prays that the <lb/>
            divine voice, dwelling for evermore in his soul, may awaken <lb/>
            and vivify it.</p>
          <p>XXXVIII. And he indeed prays that the hearing of sacred <lb/>
            words and the learning of sacred doctrine may live, as has been <lb/>
            already said; but Jacob, the practiser of virtue, prays that <lb/>
            the good natural disposition may live; for he says, " May <lb/>
            Reuben live and not die,"* does he then here pray for immor­ <lb/>
            tality for him, a thing impossible for man to attain to? <lb/>
            Surely not, we must then explain what it is which he intends <lb/>
            to signify. All the lessons and all the admonitions of in­ <lb/>
            struction are built up and established on the nature which is <lb/>
            calculated to receive instruction, as on a foundation previously <lb/>
            laid; but if there is no natural foundation previously in <lb/>
            existence, everything is useless; for men, by nature destitute <lb/>
            of sense, would not appear at all to differ from a stock or a <lb/>
            lifeless stone; for nothing could possibly be adapted to them <lb/>
            so as to cleave to them, but everything would rebound and <lb/>
            spring back as from some hard body.</p>
          <p>But on the other hand, we may see the souls of those who <lb/>
            are well endowed by nature, like a well-smoothed waxen tablet, <lb/>
            neither too solid nor too tender, moderately tempered, and <lb/>
            easily receiving all admonitions and all lessons, and themselves <lb/>
            giving an accurate representation of any impression which has <lb/>
            been stamped upon them, being a sort of distinct image of <lb/>
            memory.</p>
          <p>It was therefore indispensable to pray that a good natural <lb/>
            disposition, free from all disease and from all mortality, should <lb/>
            be joined to the rational race ; for they are but few who partake <lb/>
            of the life according to virtue, which is the most real and <lb/>
            genuine life. I do not mean of the common herd of men <note type="footnote"> * Deuteronomy xxxiii. 6. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="281"/>
            only, for of them there is not one who partakes of real life : <lb/>
            but even of those to whom it has been granted to shun the <lb/>
            objects of human desire, and to live to God alone. On which <lb/>
            account the practiser of virtue, that courageous man, marvelled <lb/>
            greatly, if any one being borne along the middle of the stream <lb/>
            of life, was not dragged down by any violence, but was able to <lb/>
            withstand the flow of abundant wealth coming over him, and <lb/>
            to stem the impetuosity of immoderate pleasure, and to avoid <lb/>
            being carried away by the whirlwind of vain opinion.</p>
          <p>At all events Jacob does not speak to Joseph more than the <lb/>
            sacred scripture speaks to every one who is vigorous in his <lb/>
            body, and who is seen to be immersed amid abundant treasures, <lb/>
            and riches, and superfluities, and to be overcome by none of <lb/>
            them, when he says, " For still thou livest," uttering a most <lb/>
            marvellous sentiment, and one which is quite beyond the daily <lb/>
            life of us who, if we have fallen in with ever so slight a breeze <lb/>
            which bears us towards good fortune, immediately set all sail <lb/>
            and become greatly elated, and being full of great and high <lb/>
            spirits, hurry forward with all our speed to the indulgence of <lb/>
            our passions, and never will check our unbridled and immo­ <lb/>
            derately excited desires until we run ashore and are wrecked <lb/>
            as to the whole vessel of our souls.</p>
          <p>XXXIX. Very beautifully therefore, do we pray that this <lb/>
            Ishmael may live. Therefore, Abraham adds, " May he live <lb/>
            before God," looking upon it as the perfection of all happiness <lb/>
            for the mind to be accounted worthy of him who is the most <lb/>
            excellent of all beings, as its inspector and overseer; for if, <lb/>
            while the teacher is present the pupil cannot go wrong, and if <lb/>
            a monitor being at hand is of service to the learner, and if <lb/>
            while an elder person is present the younger man is adorned <lb/>
            by modesty and temperance, and if the presence of his father <lb/>
            or of his mother have often prevented a son when about to <lb/>
            commit sin, even though they are only beheld by him in <lb/>
            silence, then what excess of good must we imagine that man to <lb/>
            enjoy, who believes that he is always watched and beheld by <lb/>
            God ? for while he fears and reverences and looks up to the <lb/>
            dignity of him as being present, he will flee from committing <lb/>
            iniquity with all his might.</p>
          <p>But when he prays that Ishmael may live, he does not <lb/>
            despair of the birth of Isaac, as I have already said, but he <lb/>
            believes in God ; for it does not follow that what it is possibly <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xlv. 28. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="282"/>
            for God to give, it is also possible for man to receive, since to <lb/>
            God it is easy to give the most numerous and important <lb/>
            benefits, but to us it is not easy to accept of the gifts which <lb/>
            are proffered to us ; for we must be content, if, by means <lb/>
            of labour and diligence, we obtain a share of those good things <lb/>
            which are familiar and customary to us. But there is no hope <lb/>
            that we can attain to those which come of their own accord, <lb/>
            and from some ever ready and previously prepared source, <lb/>
            without any art, or in short, any human contrivance whatever; <lb/>
            for inasmuch as these things are divine, they must of neces­ <lb/>
            sity be found out by more divine and unadulterated natures, <lb/>
            such as have no connection with any mortal body. And Moses <lb/>
            has shown that every one, to the best of his power, ought to <lb/>
            make grateful acknowledgments for benefits received; for <lb/>
            instance, that the clever man ought to offer up as a sacrifice <lb/>
            his acuteness and wisdom ; the eloquent man should consecrate <lb/>
            all his excellences of speech, by means of psalms and a regular <lb/>
            enumeration of the greatness and panegyric on the living God; <lb/>
            and to proceed with each species, he who is a natural philoso­ <lb/>
            pher should offer up his natural philosophy; he who is a <lb/>
            moral philosopher should make an offering of his ethical <lb/>
            philosophy; he who is skilful in any art or science should <lb/>
            dedicate to God his knowledge of the arts and sciences.</p>
          <p>Thus again a sailor and a pilot should dedicate their suc­ <lb/>
            cessful voyage ; the agricultural farmer, his productive crops; <lb/>
            the stock-farmer, the prolific increase of his flocks and herds; <lb/>
            the physician, the good health of his patients ; the commander <lb/>
            of an army, his success in war; the magistrate or the king will <lb/>
            offer up his administration of the laws or his sovereign power. <lb/>
            And, in short, the man who is not blinded by self-love, looks <lb/>
            upon the only true maker of all things, God, as the cause of <lb/>
            all the good things affecting his soul, or body, or his external <lb/>
            circumstances. Let no one therefore, of those who seem to be <lb/>
            somewhat obscure and humble, from a despair of any better <lb/>
            hope, hesitate to become a suppliant to God. But even if he <lb/>
            no longer looks forward to any greater advantages, still let <lb/>
            him, to the best of his power, give God thanks for the blessings <lb/>
            which he has already received, and in effect, those which he <lb/>
            has received are countless; his birth, his life, his soul, his <lb/>
            food, his outward senses, his imagination, his inclinations, his <lb/>
            reason; and reason is a very short word, but a most perfect <lb/>
            and admirable thing, a fragment, of the soul of the universe, <lb/>
             <pb n="283"/>
            or, as it is more pious to say for those who study philosophy <lb/>
            according to Moses, a very faithful copy of the divine image.</p>
          <p>XL. It is right also to praise those inquirers after truth, <lb/>
            who have endeavoured to tear up and carry off the whole trunk <lb/>
            of virtue, root and branch : but since they have not been able <lb/>
            to do it, have at least taken either a single, shoot, or a single <lb/>
            bunch of the fruit, as a specimen and portion of the whole tree, <lb/>
            being all that they were able to bear.*</p>
          <p>It is a desirable thing, indeed, to associate at once with the <lb/>
            entire company of the virtues; but if this be too great an <lb/>
            indulgence to be granted to human nature, let us be content if <lb/>
            it has fallen to our lot to be connected with any one of the <lb/>
            particular virtues, as a portion of the whole band, such as <lb/>
            temperance, or courage, or justice, or humanity; for the soul <lb/>
            may produce and bring forth some good from even one of them, <lb/>
            and so avoid being barren and unproductive of any.</p>
          <p>But will you impose any such injunctions as these on your <lb/>
            own son? Unless you treat your servants with gentleness, <lb/>
            do not treat those of the same rank as yourself socially. Un­ <lb/>
            less you behave decorously to your wife, never bear yourself <lb/>
            respectfully to your parents. If you neglect your father and <lb/>
            your mother, be impious also towards God. If you delight in <lb/>
            pleasure, you must not keep aloof from covetousness. Do you <lb/>
            de*sire great riches ? Then be also eager for vain-glory. For what <lb/>
            more need we add ? Need you not desire to be moderate in <lb/>
            some things unless you are able to be so in all? Would'not <lb/>
            your son say to you in such a case, My father, what do you <lb/>
            mean ? Do you wish your son to become either perfectly <lb/>
            good or perfectly bad, and will you not be content if he keeps <lb/>
            the middle path between the two extremes ? Was it not for <lb/>
            this reason that Abraham also, at the time of the destruction <lb/>
            of Sodom, began at fifty and ended at ten ?t</p>
          <p>Therefore, propitiating and supplicating God, entreat him <lb/>
            that if there could not be found among his creatures a com­ <lb/>
            plete remission so as to give them liberty, of which the sacred <lb/>
            number of fifty is a symbol, at least the intermediate instruc­ <lb/>
            tion which is equal in number to the decade, might be <lb/>
            accepted for the sake of the deliverance of the soul which was <lb/>
            about to be condemned. But those who are instructed have <lb/>
            many more opportunities of prayer than those who are desti­ <lb/>
            tute of teachers, and those who are well initiated in encyclical <note type="footnote"> * Numbers xiii. 25. </note> <note type="footnote"> † Gene3is xviii. 32. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="284"/>
            accomplishments have more opportunities than those who are <lb/>
            unmusical and illiterate, inasmuch as they from their childhood <lb/>
            almost have been imbued with all the lessons of virtue, and <lb/>
            temperance, and all kinds of excellence. Wherefore, even <lb/>
            if they have not entirely got rid of and effaced old marks <lb/>
            of iniquity so as to wear a completely clean appearance, at <lb/>
            least they have purified themselves in a reasonable and mode­ <lb/>
            rate degree.</p>
          <p>And it is something like this that Esau seems to have said <lb/>
            to his father, “Have you not one blessing for me, 0 my father ? <lb/>
            Bless me, bless me, also, 0 my father! "* For different <lb/>
            blessings have been set apart for different persons, perfect <lb/>
            blessings for the perfect, and moderate blessings for the im­ <lb/>
            perfect. As is the case also with bodies; for there are <lb/>
            different exercises appropriate to those which are in health, <lb/>
            and to those which are sick. And also different regimens of <lb/>
            food, and different systems of living, and not the same. But <lb/>
            some things are suitable to the one kind that they may not <lb/>
            become at all diseased; and other things are good for the <lb/>
            other sort, that they may be changed and rendered more <lb/>
            healthy.</p>
          <p>Since, therefore, there are many good things existing in <lb/>
            nature, give me that which appears to be best adapted to my <lb/>
            circumstances, even if it be the most trifling thing possible; <lb/>
            looking at this one point alone, whether I shall be able to bear <lb/>
            what is given mei with equanimity, and not, like a wretched <lb/>
            person, sink under and be overwhelmed by it.</p>
          <p>Again, what do we imagine to be meant by the words, " Will <lb/>
            not the hand of the Lord be sufficient ?"t Do they not sig­ <lb/>
            nify that the powers of the living God penetrate everywhere <lb/>
            for the purpose of conferring benefits, not only on those who <lb/>
            are noble, but on those also who appear to be in a more ob­ <lb/>
            scure condition, to whom also God gives such things as are <lb/>
            suitable to the measure and weight of the soul of each indi­ <lb/>
            vidual, conjecturing and measuring in his own mind with <lb/>
            perfect equality what is proportionate to the circumstances and <lb/>
            requirements of each.</p>
          <p>XLI. But what makes an impression on me in no ordinary <lb/>
            degree is the law which is enacted with respect to those who <lb/>
            put off their sins and seem to be repentant. For this law <lb/>
            commands that the first victim which such persons offer shall <note type="footnote"> it Genesis xxvii. 28. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Numbers xi. 23. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="285"/>
            be a female sheep without spot. But if, it proceeds, " his <lb/>
            hand is not strong enough to bring a sheep, then for the trespass <lb/>
            which he has committed he shall bring two turtle doves or <lb/>
            two young pigeons, one for his trespass and one for a burnt <lb/>
            offering ; and if his hand cannot find a pair of turtle doves or <lb/>
            two young pigeons, then he shall bring as his gift the tenth part <lb/>
            of an ephah of fine flour for a sin offering; he shall not pour <lb/>
            oil upon it, nor shall he place any frankincense thereon, <lb/>
            because it is a sin offering ; and he shall bring it to the priest, <lb/>
            and the priest having taken it from him shall take a full hand­ <lb/>
            ful of it, and place it as a memorial on the altar."*</p>
          <p>God therefore here is propitiated by three different kinds <lb/>
            of repentance, by the aforesaid beasts, or by the birds, or by <lb/>
            the white flour, according, in short, to the ability of him who <lb/>
            is being purified and who repents. For small offences do not <lb/>
            require great purifications, nor are small purifications fit for <lb/>
            great crimes; but they should be equal, and similar, and in <lb/>
            due proportion. It is worth while, therefore, to examine what <lb/>
            is meant by this purification which may be accomplished in <lb/>
            three ways.</p>
          <p>Now it may almost be said that both offences and good <lb/>
            actions are perceived to exist in three things; in intention, or <lb/>
            in words, or in actions. On which account Moses, teaching in <lb/>
            his hortatory admonitions that the attainment of good is not <lb/>
            impossible nor even very difficult, says, " It is not necessary <lb/>
            to soar up to heaven, nor to go to the borders of the earth <lb/>
            and sea, for the attainment of it, but it is near, yea, and very <lb/>
            near.”† And then in a subsequent passage he shows it all <lb/>
            but to the naked eye as one may say, where he says, " Every <lb/>
            action is in thy mouth, or in thy heart, or in thy hands <lb/>
            meaning under this symbolical expression, in thy words, or in <lb/>
            thy designs, or in thy actions. For he means that human <lb/>
            happiness consists in wise design, and good language, and <lb/>
            righteous actions, just as the unhappiness arises from the con <lb/>
            trary course. For both well-doing and wrong-doing exist in <lb/>
            the same regions, in the heart, or in the mouth, or in the hand ; <lb/>
            for some persons decide in the most righteous, and sagacious <lb/>
            manner, some speak most excellently, some do only what ought <lb/>
            to be done : again, of the three sources of error the most unim­ <lb/>
            portant is to design to do what ought not to be done, the most <lb/>
            grievous is to do what is iniquitous, the middle evil is to speak <note type="footnote"> * Leviticus v. 5. </note> <note type="footnote"> † Deut. xxx. 10. </note> <note type="footnote">‡ Deut. xxx. 14. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="286"/>
            improperly. But it often happens that even what is least im­ <lb/>
            portant is the most difficult to be removed ; for it is very hard <lb/>
            to bring an agitated state of the soul to tranquillity ; and one <lb/>
            may more easily check the impetuosity of a torrent than the <lb/>
            perversion of the soul which is hurrying in a wrong direction, <lb/>
            without restraint. For innumerable notions coming one upon <lb/>
            the other like the waves of a stormy sea, bearing everything <lb/>
            along with them, and throwing everything into confusion, <lb/>
            overturn the whole soul with irresistible violence.</p>
          <p>Therefore the most excellent, and most perfect kind of pu­ <lb/>
            rification is this, not to admit into one's "mind any improper <lb/>
            notions, but to regulate it in peace and obedience to law, the <lb/>
            ruler of which principles is justice. The next kind is, not to <lb/>
            offend in one's language either by speaking falsely, or by <lb/>
            swearing falsely, or by deceiving, or by practising sophistry, <lb/>
            or by laying false informations; or, in short, by letting loose one's <lb/>
            mouth and tongue to the injury of any one, as it is better to <lb/>
            put a bridle and an insuperable chain on those members.</p>
          <p>XLII. But why it is a more grievous offence to say what <lb/>
            is wrong than only to think it, is very easy to see. For some <lb/>
            times a person thinks without any deliberate previous inten­ <lb/>
            tion of so thinking, but inconsiderately : for he is compelled to <lb/>
            admit ideas in his mind which he does not wish to admit; and <lb/>
            nothing which is involuntary is blameable : but a man speaks <lb/>
            intentionally, so that if he utters words which are not proper <lb/>
            he is unhappy and is committing offence, since he does not <lb/>
            even by chance choose to say anything that is proper, and it <lb/>
            would be more for his advantage to adopt that safest expedient <lb/>
            of silence : and, in the second place, anyone who is not silent <lb/>
            can be silent if he pleases.</p>
          <p>But what is even a still more grievous offence than speaking <lb/>
            wrongly, is unjust action. For the word, as it is said, is the <lb/>
            shadow of the deed ; and how can an injurious deed help being <lb/>
            more mischievous than a shadow of the same character ? On <lb/>
            this account Moses released the mind, even when it yielded to <lb/>
            many involuntary perversions and errors, from accusations and <lb/>
            from penalties, thinking that it was rather acted upon by <lb/>
            notions which forced their way into it, than was itself acting.</p>
          <p>But whatever goes out through the mouth that he makes the <lb/>
            utterer responsible for and brings him before the tribunal, <lb/>
            since the act of speaking is one which is in our own power. <lb/>
            But the investigation to which words are subject is a more <lb/>
             <pb n="287"/>
            moderate one, and that -with whicn words are united is a more <lb/>
            vigorous one. For he imposes severe punishments on those <lb/>
            who commit gross offences, and who carry out in action, and <lb/>
            utter with hasty tongues what they have designed in their <lb/>
            unjust minds.</p>
          <p>XLIII. Therefore he has called the purifying victims which <lb/>
            are to be offered up for the three offenders, the mind, <lb/>
            speech, and the action, a sheep, and a pair of turtle doves or <lb/>
            pigeons, and the tenth part of a sacred measure of fine flour; <lb/>
            thinking it fit that the mind should be purified by a sheep, <lb/>
            the speech by winged creatures, and the action by fine flour: <lb/>
            Why is this ? Because, as the mind is the most excellent <lb/>
            thing in us, so also is the sheep the most excellent among <lb/>
            irrational animals, inasmuch as it is the most gentle, and also <lb/>
            as it gives forth a yearly produce in its fleece, for the use and <lb/>
            also for the ornament of mankind. For clothes keep off all <lb/>
            injury from both cold and heat, and also they conceal the <lb/>
            unmentionable parts of nature, and in this way they are an <lb/>
            ornament to those who use them: therefore the sheep, as <lb/>
            being the most excellent of animals, is a symbol of the purifi­ <lb/>
            cation of the most excellent part of man, the mind.</p>
          <p>And birds are an emblem of the purification of the speech : <lb/>
            for speech is a light thing, and winged by nature, flying and <lb/>
            penetrating in every direction more swiftly than an arrow. <lb/>
            For what is once said can never be re-called ;* but being borne <lb/>
            abroad, and running on with great swiftness, it strikes the ears <lb/>
            and penetrates every sense of hearing, resounding loudly: <lb/>
            but speech is of two kinds, one true and the other false; on <lb/>
            which account it appears to me to be here compared to a pair <lb/>
            of turtle doves or young pigeons : and of these birds one he <lb/>
            says is to be looked upon as a sin offering, and one is to be <lb/>
            sacrificed as a burnt offering, since the speech which is true <lb/>
            is wholly and in all respects sacred and perfect, but that which <lb/>
            is false is very wrong and requires correction.</p>
          <p>Again, as I have already said, fine flour is a symbol of the <lb/>
            purification of activity, but it is sorted from the commoner sort <lb/>
            by the hands of the bakers, who make the business their study. <note type="footnote">* This resembles what is said by Horace— <lb/>
            Nescit vox missa reverti.—A. P. 390. <lb/>
            And in another place— <lb/>
            Et semel emissum volat irrevocabile verbum.—Epist. I. 18, 71. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="288"/>
            On which account the law says, “And the priest having, taken <lb/>
            an entire handful, shall place it on the altar as a memorial of <lb/>
            them," by the word handful, indicating both the endeavour and <lb/>
            the action.</p>
          <p>And he speaks with exceeding accuracy with respect to the <lb/>
            sheep, when he says, " And if his hand be not strong enough <lb/>
            to supply a sheep;" but with respect to the birds he says, <lb/>
            " And if he cannot find a bird." Why is this? Because it is a <lb/>
            sign of very great strength and of excessive power, to get rid <lb/>
            of the errors of the mind: but it does not require any great <lb/>
            strength, to check the errors of words; for, as I have said <lb/>
            already, silence is a remedy for all the offences that can be <lb/>
            committed by the voice, and every one may easily practise <lb/>
            silence ; but yet, by reason of their chattering habits and want <lb/>
            of moderation in their language, many people cannot find out <lb/>
            how to impose a limitation on their speech.</p>
          <p>XLIV. Since then, the virtuous man has been bred up <lb/>
            among and practised in these and similar divisions and <lb/>
            discriminations of things, does he not rightly appear to pray <lb/>
            that Ishmael may live, if he is not as yet able to become the <lb/>
            father of Isaac ? What then does the merciful God say ? To <lb/>
            him who asks for one thing he gives two, and on him who <lb/>
            prays for what is less he bestows what is greater ; for, says the <lb/>
            historian, he said unto Abraham, "Yea, behold, Sarrah thy wife <lb/>
            shall bring forth a son.”* Very felicitous and significant is <lb/>
            this answer, “Yea;” for what can be more suitable to and more <lb/>
            like the character of God, than to promise good things and to <lb/>
            ratify that promise with all speed ! But what God promises <lb/>
            every foolish man repudiates; therefore the sacred scriptures <lb/>
            represent Leah as hated, and on this account it is that she <lb/>
            received that name; for Leah, being interpreted, means <lb/>
            “repudiating and labouring," because we all turn away from <lb/>
            virtue and think it a laborious thing, by reason of its very <lb/>
            often imposing commands on us which are not pleasant. But <lb/>
            nevertheless, she is thought worthy of such an honourable <lb/>
            reception from the prince, that her womb is opened by him, so <lb/>
            as to receive the seed of divine generation, in order to the <lb/>
            production of honourable pursuits and actions.</p>
          <p>Learn therefore, 0 soul, that Sarrah, that is, virtue, will <lb/>
            bring forth to thee a son; and that Hagar, or intermediate <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xvii 19. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="289"/>
            instruction, is not the only one who will do so; for her <lb/>
            offspring is one which has its knowledge from teaching, but the <lb/>
            offspring of the other is entirely self-taught. And do not <lb/>
            wonder, if God, who brings forth all good things, has also <lb/>
            brought forth this race, which, though rare upon the earth, <lb/>
            is very numerous in heaven. And you may learn this also from <lb/>
            other things of which man consists: do the eyes see from <lb/>
            having been taught to do so ? And what do the nostrils do ? <lb/>
            Do they smell by reason of their having learnt ? <foreign xml:lang="grc">·</foreign> And do the <lb/>
            hands touch, or the feet advance, in accordance with the coin­ <lb/>
            mands or recommendations of instructors ? Again, do the <lb/>
            appetites and imaginations (and these are the first moving <lb/>
            powers and persuasions of the soul) exist in consequence <lb/>
            of teaching ? And has our mind gone as a pupil to any <lb/>
            sophist, in order to learn to think and to comprehend ? All <lb/>
            these things repudiate all kinds of instruction, and avail them­ <lb/>
            selves only of the spontaneous gifts of nature to exert their <lb/>
            appropriate energies.</p>
          <p>Why then do you any longer wonder if God showers upon <lb/>
            men virtue, unaccompanied by any labour or suffering, such as <lb/>
            stand in need of no superintending care or instruction, but is <lb/>
            from the very beginning entire and perfect ? And if you wish <lb/>
            to receive any testimony in corroboration of this view, can you <lb/>
            find any more trustworthy than that of Moses ? And he says <lb/>
            that the rest of mankind derive their food from the earth, but <lb/>
            that he alone who is endowed with the power of sight, derives <lb/>
            his from heaven. And men occupied in agriculture co-operate <lb/>
            to produce the food from the earth; but God, the only cause <lb/>
            and giver, rains down the food from heaven without the <lb/>
            co-operation of any other being.</p>
          <p>And, indeed, we read in the scriptures, " Behold, I rain <lb/>
            upon you bread from heaven.”* Now what nourishment can <lb/>
            the scriptures properly say is rained down, except heavenly <lb/>
            wisdom ? which God sends from above upon those souls which <lb/>
            have a longing for virtue, God who possesses a great abund­ <lb/>
            ance and exceeding treasure of wisdom, and who irrigates the <lb/>
            universe, and especially so on the sacred seventh day which he <lb/>
            calls the sabbath; for then, he says, that there is an influx of <lb/>
            spontaneous good things, not rising from any kind of art, but <note type="footnote"> Exodus xvi. 4. </note> <note type="footnote"> VOL. II. </note> <note type="footnote"> u </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="290"/>
            shooting up by their own spontaneous and self-perfecting <lb/>
            nature, and bearing appropriate fruit.</p>
          <p>XLV. Virtue, therefore, will bring thee forth a legitimate <lb/>
            male child, far removed from all effeminate passions ; and thou <lb/>
            shalt call the name of thy son by the name of the passion <lb/>
            which thou feelest in regard to him ; and thou wilt by all <lb/>
            means feel joy; so that thou shalt give him a name which is <lb/>
            an emblem of joy, namely, Laughter. As grief and fear have <lb/>
            their appropriate expressions which the passion, when more <lb/>
            than usually violent and predominant, gives utterance to; so <lb/>
            also, good counsels and happiness compel a mail to employ a <lb/>
            natural expression of them, for which no one could tind out <lb/>
            more appropriate and felicitous names, even if he were very <lb/>
            skilful in the imposition of names. On which account God <lb/>
            says, " I have blessed him, I will increase him, I will multiply <lb/>
            him, he shall beget twelve nations that is to say, he shall <lb/>
            beget the whole circle and ring of the sophistical preliminary <lb/>
            branches of education; but I will make my covenant with <lb/>
            Israel, that the race of mankind may receive each kind of <lb/>
            virtue, the weaker part of them receiving both that which is <lb/>
            taught by others, and that which is learnt by one's self, and the <lb/>
            stronger part that which is ready and prepared.</p>
          <p>XLVI. " And at that time," says he, “she shall bring forth <lb/>
            a son to thee ; ”† that is to say, wisdom shall bring forth joy. <lb/>
            What time, 0 most marvellous being, are you pointing out ? <lb/>
            Is it that which cannot be indicated by the thing brought <lb/>
            forth? For that must be the real time, the rising of the <lb/>
            universe, the prosperity and happiness of the whole earth, and <lb/>
            of heaven, and of all intermediate natures, and of all animals, <lb/>
            and of all plants. On which account Moses also took courage <lb/>
            to say to those who had run away, and who did not dare to <lb/>
            enter upon a war in the cause of virtue against those who were <lb/>
            arrayed against it, “The Lord has departed from them, but <lb/>
            the Lord is in us ;”‡ for he here almost confesses in express <lb/>
            words that God is time, who stands aloof and at a distance <lb/>
            from every impious person; but walks among those souls which <lb/>
            cultivate virtue. “For," says he, " I will walk among you, and <lb/>
            I will be your God.”§ But those who say that what is meant <lb/>
            by time is only the seasons of the year are misapplying the <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xvii. 20. </note><note type="footnote">‡ Numbers xiv. 9. </note> <note type="footnote"> + Genesis xv. 10. </note><note type="footnote"> § Leviticus xxvi. 12. </note> <lb/>

            names with great inaccuracy, like men who have not studied <lb/>
            the natures of things with any care, but have gone on to a <lb/>
            great degree at random.</p>
          <p>XL VII. But by way of amplifying the beauty of the creature <lb/>
            to be born, he says that it shall be born the next year, indicating <lb/>
            by the term, " the next year,"* not a difference of time, such as <lb/>
            is measured by lunar or solar periods, but that which is truly <lb/>
            marvellous, and strange, and new. being an age which is very <lb/>
            different from those which are visible to the eyes and percep­ <lb/>
            tible to the outward senses, being investigated in incorporeal <lb/>
            things appreciable only by the intellect, which, in fact, is the <lb/>
            model and archetype of time. But an age is a name given to <lb/>
            the life of the world, intelligible only by the intellect, as time <lb/>
            is that given to the life of the world, perceptible by the out­ <lb/>
            ward senses.</p>
          <p>And in this year the man who had sown the graces of God <lb/>
            so as to produce many more good things, in order that the <lb/>
            greatest possible number of persons worthy to share them <lb/>
            might participate in them, finds also the barley producing a <lb/>
            hundredfold.! But he who has sown does usually also reap. <lb/>
            And he sowed, displaying the virtue, the enemy of envy and <lb/>
            wickedness; he is, however, here said to find, not to reap. <lb/>
            For he who has made the ear of his good deeds more produc­ <lb/>
            tive and full, was a different person, having laid up an abund­ <lb/>
            ance of greater hopes well prepared, and he also proposed <lb/>
            more abundant advantages to all those who sought them, <lb/>
            encouraging them to hope to find them.</p>
          <p>XLVIII. And the words, “He finished speaking to him,”‡ <lb/>
            are equivalent to saying, he made his hearer perfect, though <lb/>
            he was devoid of wisdom before, and he filled him with <lb/>
            immortal lessons. But when his disciple became perfect, the <lb/>
            Lord went up and departed from Abraham, showing, not that <lb/>
            he separated himself from him ; for the wise man is naturally <lb/>
            an attendant of God, not wishing to represent the spontaneous <lb/>
            inclination of the disciple in order that as he had learnt while <lb/>
            his teacher was no longer standing by him, and without any <lb/>
            necessity urging him, giving of his own accord a specimen of <lb/>
            himself, and displaying a voluntary and spontaneous eagerness <lb/>
            to learn, he might for the future exert his energies by himself; <lb/>
            for the teacher assigns a model to him who has learnt by <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xviii 10. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Genesis xxvi. 12. </note> <note type="footnote">† Genesis XVII 22. </note> <note type="footnote"> u 2 </note> <lb/>

            <title type="main">A TREATISE ON THE DOCTRINE THAT DREAMS ARE SENT FROM GOD. BOOK I.</title>
          </head>
          <p>1. THE treatise before this one has contained our opinions <lb/>
            on those visions sent from heaven which are classed under <lb/>
            the first species; in reference to which subject we delivered <lb/>
            our opinion that the Deity sent the appearances which are <lb/>
            beheld by man in dreams in accordance with the suggestions <lb/>
            of his own nature. But in this treatise we will, to the best of <lb/>
            our power, describe those dreams which come under the <lb/>
            second species.</p>
          <p>Now the second species is that in which our mind, being <lb/>
            moved simultaneously with the mind of the universe, has <lb/>
            appeared to be hurried away by itself and to be under the <lb/>
            influence of divine impulses, so as to be rendered capable of <lb/>
            comprehending beforehand, and knowing by anticipation some <lb/>
            of the events of the future. Now the first dream which is <lb/>
            akin to the species which I have been describing, is that which <lb/>
            appeared on the ladder which reached up to heaven, and which <lb/>
            was of this kind.</p>
          <p>“And Jacob dreamed, and behold a ladder was firmly <lb/>
            planted on the earth, the head of which reached up to heaven; <lb/>
            and the angels of God were ascending and descending on it. <lb/>
            And behold there was a ladder firmly planted on the earth, <lb/>
            and the Lord was standing steadily upon it; and he said, I am <lb/>
            the God of Abraham thy father, and the God of Isaac : be not <lb/>
            afraid. The earth on which thou art sleeping I will give unto <lb/>
            thee and unto thy seed, and thy seed shall be as the dust of <lb/>
            the earth, and it shall be multiplied as the sand on the sea­ <lb/>
            shore, and shall spread to the south, and to the north, and to <lb/>
            the east ; and in thee shall all the kindreds of the earth be <lb/>
             <pb n="293"/>
            blessed, and in thy seed also. And, behold, I am with thee, <lb/>
            keeping thee in all thy ways, by whichever thou goest, and I <lb/>
            will bring thee again into this land ; because I will not leave <lb/>
            thee until I have done everything which I have said unto <lb/>
            thee.”*</p>
          <p>But the previous consideration of the circumstances of this <lb/>
            vision require that we should examine them with accuracy, <lb/>
            and then perhaps we shall be able to comprehend what is in­ <lb/>
            dicated by the vision. What, then, are the previous circum­ <lb/>
            stances ? The scripture tells us, " And Jacob went up <lb/>
            from the well of the oath, and came to Charran, and went into <lb/>
            a place and lay down there until the sun arose. And he took <lb/>
            one of the stones of the place and placed it at his head, and went <lb/>
            to sleep in that place." And immediately afterwards came the <lb/>
            dream. Therefore it is well at the outset to raise a question <lb/>
            on these three points :-One, What was the well of the oath,t <lb/>
            and why was it called by this name ? Secondly, What is <lb/>
            Charran, and why, after Jacob had departed from the well be­ <lb/>
            forementioned, did he immediately go to Charran ? Thirdly, <lb/>
            What was the place, and why, when he was in it, did the sun <lb/>
            at once set, and did he go to sleep ?</p>
          <p>II. Let us then at once begin and consider the first of these <lb/>
            points. To me, then, the well appears to be an emblem of <lb/>
            knowledge ; for its nature is not superficial, but very deep. <lb/>
            Nor does it lie in an open place, but a well is fond of being <lb/>
            hidden somewhere in secret. Nor is it found with ease, but <lb/>
            only after great labour and with difficulty ; and this too is seen <lb/>
            to be the case with sciences, not only with such as have great <lb/>
            and indescribable subjects of speculation, but even with re­ <lb/>
            spect to such as are the most insignificant. Choose, therefore, <lb/>
            whichever art you please ; not the most excellent, but even the <lb/>
            most obscure of all, which perhaps no one who has been bred <lb/>
            a free man in the whole city would ever study of his own ac­ <lb/>
            cord, and which scarcely any servant in the field would attend <lb/>
            to, who, against his will, was a slave to some morose and ill­ <lb/>
            tempered master who compelled him to do many unpleasant <lb/>
            things.</p>
          <p>For the matter will be found to be not a simple one, but <lb/>
            rather one of great complications and variety, not easy to be <lb/>
            seized upon, but difficult to discover, difficult to master, hostile <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xxviii. 12. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Genesis xxvi. 33. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="294"/>
            to delay, and indolence and indifference, full of earnestness <lb/>
            and contention, and sweat, and care. For which reason <lb/>
            " those who dig in this well say that they cannot find even <lb/>
            water in it;" because the ends of science are not only hard to <lb/>
            discover, but are even altogether undiscoverable ; and it is <lb/>
            owing to this that one man is more thoroughy skilled in gram­ <lb/>
            mar or in geometry than another, because of its being <lb/>
            impossible to circumscribe, increase, and extend one within <lb/>
            certain limits; for there is always more that is left behind <lb/>
            than what comes to be learnt; and what is left watches for <lb/>
            and catches the learner, so that even lie who fancies that he <lb/>
            has comprehended and mastered the very extremities of know­ <lb/>
            ledge would be considered but half perfect by another person <lb/>
            who was his judge, and if he were before the tribunal of truth <lb/>
            would appear to be only beginning knowledge; for life is short, <lb/>
            as some one has said, but art is long; of which that man most <lb/>
            thoroughly comprehends the magnitude, who sincerely and <lb/>
            honestly plunges deeply into it, and who digs it out like a well. <lb/>
            And such a man, when he is at the point of death, being now <lb/>
            grey-headed and exceedingly old, it is said, wept, not that he <lb/>
            feared death as being a coward, but out of a desire for instruc­ <lb/>
            tion, as feeling that he was now, for the first time, entering <lb/>
            upon it when lie was finally departing from life.</p>
          <p>For the soul flourishes for the pursuit of knowledge when <lb/>
            the prime vigour of the body is withering away from the lapse <lb/>
            of time; therefore, before one has arrived at one's prime <lb/>
            and vigour by reason of a more accurate comprehension of <lb/>
            things, it is not difficult to be tripped up. But this accident <lb/>
            is common to all people who are fond of learning, to whom <lb/>
            new subjects of contemplation are continually rising up and <lb/>
            striving after old ones, the soul itself producing many such <lb/>
            subjects when it is not barren and unproductive. And nature, <lb/>
            also, unexpectedly and spontaneously displaying a great num­ <lb/>
            ber to those who are gifted with acute and penetrating <lb/>
            intellects. Therefore the well of knowledge is shown to be <lb/>
            of this kind, having no boundary and no end.</p>
          <p>We must now explain why it was called the well of the <lb/>
            oath. Those matters which are doubted about are decided by <lb/>
            an oath, and those which are uncertain are confirmed in the <lb/>
            same manner, and so, too, those which want certification <lb/>
            receive it; from which facts this inference is drawn, that <lb/>
             <pb n="295"/>
            there is no subject respecting which any one can make an <lb/>
            affirmation with greater certainty than he can respecting the <lb/>
            fact that the race of wisdom is without limitation and without <lb/>
            end. It is well, therefore, to enrol one's self under the banners <lb/>
            of one who discusses these matters without an oath; but he <lb/>
            who is not very much inclined to assent to the assertions or <lb/>
            another will at least assent to them when he has made oath to <lb/>
            their correctness. But let no one refuse to take an oath of <lb/>
            this kind, well knowing that he will have his name inscribed <lb/>
            on pillars among those who are faithful to their oaths.</p>
          <p>III. However, enough of this. The next thing must be <lb/>
            to consider why it is that as four wells had been dug by the <lb/>
            servants of Abraham and Isaac, the fourth and last was called <lb/>
            the well of the oath. May it not be that the sacred historian <lb/>
            here desires to represent, in a figurative manner, that as in <lb/>
            the universe there are four elements of which this world is <lb/>
            composed, and as there are an equal number in ourselves, of <lb/>
            which we have been fashioned before we were moulded into <lb/>
            our human shape, three of them are capable of being compre­ <lb/>
            hended somehow or other, but the fourth is unintelligible to <lb/>
            all who come forward as judges of it. Accordingly, we find <lb/>
            that the four elements in the world are the earth, and the <lb/>
            water, and the air, and the heaven, of which, even if some <lb/>
            are difficult to find, they are still not classed in the utterly <lb/>
            undiscoverable portion.</p>
          <p>For that the earth, because it is a heavy, and indissoluble, <lb/>
            and solid substance, is divided into mountains and champaign <lb/>
            districts, and intersected by rivers and seas, so that some <lb/>
            portion of it consists of islands, and some portions are con­ <lb/>
            tinent. And again, some of it has a shallow and some a deep <lb/>
            soil; and some is rough, and rugged, and strong, and alto­ <lb/>
            gether barren ; and some is smooth and delicate, and exceed­ <lb/>
            ingly fertile ; and besides all these facts we know a great <lb/>
            number of others relative to the earth.</p>
          <p>And again, there is the water, which we know has many of <lb/>
            the aforesaid qualities in common with the earth, and many <lb/>
            also peculiar to itself; for some of it is sweet, and some <lb/>
            brackish, and some is mixed up of various characteristics ; <lb/>
            and some is good to drink, and some is not drinkable ; and, <lb/>
            moreover, neither of these last qualities is invariable with <lb/>
            respect to every creature, but there are some to which it is <lb/>
             <pb n="296"/>
            the one and not the other, and vice versâ. Again, some <lb/>
            water is by nature cold, and other water naturally hot; for <lb/>
            there is in all sorts of places an infinite number of springs <lb/>
            pouring forth hot water, not on the land only but even in the <lb/>
            sea: at all events, there have appeared before now veins <lb/>
            pouring up warm water in the middle of the sea, which all <lb/>
            the enormous efflux of salt water in all the sea that <lb/>
            encircles the world, pouring over them from all eternity, <lb/>
            has never been able to extinguish, nor even in the least degree <lb/>
            to diminish.</p>
          <p>Again, we know that the air has an attractive nature, yield­ <lb/>
            ing to such bodies as surround it in an altitude of resistance, <lb/>
            being the organ of life, and breath, and sight, and hearing, <lb/>
            and all the rest of the external senses, admitting of rarifica­ <lb/>
            tion, and condensation, and motion, and tranquillity, and <lb/>
            changes, and variations of every kind, by which it is altered <lb/>
            and modified, and generating summers and winters, and the <lb/>
            seasons of autumn and spring, by means of which the circle <lb/>
            of the year is at last brought to a conclusion.</p>
          <p>IV. All these things, then, we feel: but the heaven has a <lb/>
            nature which is incomprehensible, and it has never conveyed <lb/>
            to us any distinct indication by which we can understand its <lb/>
            nature; for what can we say? that it is solid ice, as some <lb/>
            persons have chosen to assert? or that it is the purest fire? <lb/>
            or that it is a fifth body, moving in a circle having no partici­ <lb/>
            pation in any of the four elements ? For what can we say? <lb/>
            Has that most remote sphere of the fixed stars any density in <lb/>
            an upward direction ? or is it merely a superficies devoid of <lb/>
            all depth, something like a plane figure ? And what are the <lb/>
            stars? Are they masses of earth full of fire? For some <lb/>
            persons have said that they are hills, and valleys, and thickets, <lb/>
            men who are worthy of a prison and a treadmill, or of any <lb/>
            place where there are instruments proper for the punishment <lb/>
            of impious persons ; or are they, as some one has defined <lb/>
            them, a continuous and dense harmony, the closely packed, <lb/>
            indissoluble mass of æther ?</p>
          <p>Again, are they animated and intelligent? or are they <lb/>
            destitute alike of mind and vitality ? Have they their <lb/>
            motions in consequence of any choice of their own ? or merely <lb/>
            because they are compulsory?</p>
          <p>What, again, are we to say of the moon? Does she show <lb/>
             <pb n="297"/>
            us a light of her own, or a borrowed and illegitimate one, <lb/>
            only reflected from the rays of the sun ? or is neither of these <lb/>
            things true, but has she something mixed, as it were, so as to <lb/>
            be a sort of combination of her own light and of that which <lb/>
            belongs to some other body ? For all these things, and others <lb/>
            like them, belonging to the fourth and most excellent of the <lb/>
            bodies in the world, namely, the heaven, are uncertain and <lb/>
            incomprehensible, and are spoken of in accordance with <lb/>
            conjectures and guesses, and not with the solid, certain <lb/>
            reasoning of truth, so that a person might venture to swear <lb/>
            that no mortal man will ever be able to comprehend any one <lb/>
            of these matters clearly. At all events, the fourth and dry well <lb/>
            was called the well of the oath on this account, because the <lb/>
            search after the fourth element in the world, that is to say the <lb/>
            heaven, is without any result, and is in every respect fruitless.</p>
          <p>V. But let us now see in what manner that fourth element <lb/>
            in us is by nature in such an especial and singular manner <lb/>
            incomprehensible.</p>
          <p>There are, then, four principal elements in us, the body, <lb/>
            the external sense, the speech, and the mind. Now of these, <lb/>
            three are not uncertain or unintelligible in every respect, but <lb/>
            they contain some indication in themselves by which they are <lb/>
            comprehended. Now what is my meaning in this statement? <lb/>
            We know already that the body is divisible into three parts. <lb/>
            and that it is capable of motion in six directions, inasmuch as <lb/>
            it has three dimensions, in length, in depth, in breadth; and <lb/>
            twice as many motions, namely six, the upward motion, the <lb/>
            downward motion, that to the right, that to the left, the <lb/>
            forward, and the backward motion. But, moreover, we are <lb/>
            not ignorant that it is the vessel of the soul; and we are also <lb/>
            aware that it is subject to the changes of being young, of de­ <lb/>
            caying, of growing old, of dying, of undergoing dissolution. <lb/>
            And with respect to the outward senses, we are not. so far as <lb/>
            that is concerned, utterly dull and mutilated, but we are able <lb/>
            to say that that also is divided into five divisions, and that there <lb/>
            are appropriate organs for the development of each sense <lb/>
            formed by nature ; for instance, the eyes for seeing, the ears <lb/>
            for hearing, the nostrils for smelling, and the other organs for <lb/>
            the exercise of the respective senses to which they are <lb/>
            adapted, and also that we may call these outward senses <lb/>
            messengers of the mind which inform it of colours, and <lb/>
             <pb n="298"/>
            shapes, and sounds, and the peculiar differences of vapours, <lb/>
            and flavours, and, in short, which describe to it all bodies, <lb/>
            and all the distinctive qualities which exist in them.</p>
          <p>They also may be looked upon as body-guards of the soul, <lb/>
            informing it of all that they see or hear; and if anything <lb/>
            injurious attacks it from without, they foresee it, and guard <lb/>
            against it, so that it may not enter by chance and unawares, <lb/>
            and so become the cause of irremediable disaster to their <lb/>
            mistress.</p>
          <p>Again, the voice does not entirely escape our compre­ <lb/>
            hension ; but we know that one voice is shrill and another <lb/>
            deep; that one is tuneful and harmonious, and another disso­ <lb/>
            nant and very unmusical ; and again, one voice is more <lb/>
            powerful, and another less so. And they differ also in ten <lb/>
            thousand other particulars, in kind. in complexion, in distance, <lb/>
            in combined 'and separate tension of the tones, in the sympho­ <lb/>
            nies of fourths, of fifths, and of the diapason. Moreover, <lb/>
            there are some things which we know also with respect to <lb/>
            that articulate voice which has been allotted to man alone of <lb/>
            all animals, as, for instance, we know that it is emitted by the <lb/>
            mind, that it receives its articulate distinctness in the mouth, <lb/>
            that it is by the striking of the tongue that articulate utterance <lb/>
            is impressed upon the tones of the voice, and which renders <lb/>
            the uttered sound not only a bare, naked, useless noise, void <lb/>
            of all characteristic, and that it discharges the office of a <lb/>
            herald or interpreter towards the mind which suggests it.</p>
          <p>VI. Now then is the fourth element which exists within <lb/>
            us, the dominant mind, comprehensible to us in the same <lb/>
            manner as these other divisions ? Certainly not; for what do <lb/>
            we think it to he in its essence ? Do we look upon it as <lb/>
            spirit, or as blood, or, in short, as any bodily substance ! But <lb/>
            it is not a substance, but must be pronounced incorporeal. Is <lb/>
            it then a limit, or a species, or a number, or a continued act, <lb/>
            or a harmony, or any existing thing whatever? Is it, the very <lb/>
            first moment that we are born, infused into us from without, or <lb/>
            is it some warm nature in us which is cooled by the air which <lb/>
            is diffused around us, like a piece of iron which has been <lb/>
            heated at a forge, and then being plunged into cold water, is <lb/>
            by that process tempered and hardened ? (And perhaps it is <lb/>
            from the cooling process (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ψύξις</foreign>to which it is thus submitted <lb/>
            that the soul (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἡ ψυχή</foreign>) derives its name.) What more shall. <lb/>
             <pb n="299"/>
            we say ? When we die, is it extinguished and destroyed <lb/>
            together with our bodies? or does it continue to live a long <lb/>
            time ? or, thirdly, is it wholly incorruptible and immortal ?</p>
          <p>Again, where, in what part does this mind lie hid ? Has it <lb/>
            received any settled habitation? For some men have dedi­ <lb/>
            cated to it our head, as the principal citadel, around which all <lb/>
            the outward senses have their lairs; thinking it natural that <lb/>
            its body-guards should be stationed near it, as near the palace <lb/>
            of a mighty king. Some again contend earnestly in favour of <lb/>
            the position which they assign it, believing that it is enshrined <lb/>
            like a statue in the heart.</p>
          <p>Therefore now the fourth element is incomprehensible, <lb/>
            in the world the heaven, in comparison of the nature of the <lb/>
            earth, of the water, and of the air; and the mind in man, in <lb/>
            comparison of the body and the outward sense, and the <lb/>
            speech, which is the interpreter of the mind; may it not be <lb/>
            the case also, that for this reason the fourth year is described as <lb/>
            holy and praiseworthy in the sacred scriptures ? For among <lb/>
            created things, the heaven is holy in the world, in accordance <lb/>
            with which body, the imperishable and indestructible natures <lb/>
            revolve; and in man the mind is holy, being a sort of frag­ <lb/>
            ment of the Deity, and especially according to the statement <lb/>
            of Moses, who says, " God breathed into his face the breath of <lb/>
            life, and man became a living soul."*</p>
          <p>And it appears to me, that it is not without reason that <lb/>
            both these things are called praiseworthy ; for these two things, <lb/>
            the heaven and the mind, are the things which are able to <lb/>
            utter, with all becoming dignity, the praises, and hymns, and <lb/>
            glory, and beatitude of the Father who created them: for <lb/>
            man has received an especial honour beyond all other animals, <lb/>
            namely, that of ministering to the living God. And the <lb/>
            heaven is always singing melodies, perfecting an all-musical <lb/>
            harmony, in accordance with the motions of all the bodies <lb/>
            which exist therein ; of which, if the sound ever reached our <lb/>
            ears, love, which could not be restrained, and frantic desires, <lb/>
            and furious impetuosity, which could not be put an end to or <lb/>
            pacified, would be engendered, and would compel us to give <lb/>
            up even what is necessary, nourishing ourselves no longer <lb/>
            like ordinary mortals on the meat and drink, which is received <lb/>
            by means of cur throat, but on the inspired songs of music <note type="footnote"> * Genesis ii. 7. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="300"/>
            in its highest perfection, as persons about to be made im­ <lb/>
            mortal through the medium of their ears: and it is said that <lb/>
            Moses* was an incorporeal hearer of these melodies, when he <lb/>
            went for forty days, and an equal number of nights, without at <lb/>
            all touching any bread or any water.</p>
          <p>VII. Therefore the heaven, which is the archetypal organ <lb/>
            of music, appears to have been arranged in a most perfect <lb/>
            manner, for no other object except that the hymns sung to the <lb/>
            honour of the Father of the universe, might be attuned in a <lb/>
            musical manner; and we hear that virtue, that is to say, <lb/>
            Leah,† after the birth of her fourth son, was no longer able to <lb/>
            bring forth any more, but restrained, or perhaps I should say. <lb/>
            .. was restrained, as to her generative powers; for she found, I <lb/>
            conceive, all her generative power dry and barren, after she <lb/>
            had brought forth Judah, that is to say, " confession," the <lb/>
            perfect fruit: and the phrase, " Leah desisted from bearing <lb/>
            children," differs in no respect from the statement, that the <lb/>
            children of Isaac found no water in the fourth well."‡ Since <lb/>
            it appears from both these figurative expressions, that every <lb/>
            creature thirsts for Got!, by whom all their births take place, <lb/>
            and from whom nourishment is bestowed to them when they <lb/>
            are born.</p>
          <p>Perhaps therefore some petty cavilling critics will imagine <lb/>
            that all this statement about the digging of the wells is a <lb/>
            superfluous piece of prolixity on the part of the lawgiver : but <lb/>
            those who deserve a larger classification, being citizens not of <lb/>
            some petty state but of the wide world, being men of more <lb/>
            perfect wisdom, will know well that the real question is not <lb/>
            about the four wells, but about the parts of the universe that <lb/>
            the men who are gifted with sight, and are fond of contem­ <lb/>
            plation exercise their powers of investigation ; namely, about <lb/>
            the earth, the water, the air, and the heaven. And examin­ <lb/>
            ing each of these matters with the most accurately refined <lb/>
            conception, in three of them they have found some things <lb/>
            within the reach of their comprehension; on which account <lb/>
            they have given these names, injustice, enmity, and latitude to <lb/>
            what they have discovered. But in the fourth, that is to say in <lb/>
            heaven, they have found absolutely nothing whatever, which <lb/>
            they could comprehend; as we explained a little time ago : <note type="footnote"> * Exodus xxiv. 18. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Genesis xxix. 35. </note> <note type="footnote"> ‡Genesis xxvi. 32. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="301"/>
            for the fourth is found to be a well destitute of water, and dry; <lb/>
            and for the reason above mentioned it is called a well.</p>
          <p>VIII. We will now investigate what comes next, and <lb/>
            inquire what Charran is, and why the man who went up from the <lb/>
            well came to it. Charran then, as it appears to me, is a sort <lb/>
            of metropolis of the outward senses : and it is interpreted at <lb/>
            one time a pit dug, at another time holes ; one fact being <lb/>
            intimated by both these names; for our bodies are in a man­ <lb/>
            ner dug out to furnish the organs of the outward senses, and <lb/>
            each of the organs is a sort of hole for the corresponding out­ <lb/>
            ward sense in which it shelters itself as in a cave : when there­ <lb/>
            fore any one goes up from the well which is called the well of <lb/>
            the oath, as if he were leaving a harbour, he immediately does <lb/>
            of necessity come to Charran : for it is a matter of necessity <lb/>
            that the outward senses should receive one who comes on an <lb/>
            emigration from that most excellent country of knowledge, <lb/>
            unbounded as it is in extent, without any guide.</p>
          <p>For our soul is very often set In motion by its own self after <lb/>
            it has put off the whole burden of the body, and has escaped <lb/>
            from the multitude of the outward senses; and very often too, <lb/>
            even while it is still clothed in them.</p>
          <p>Therefore by its own simple motion it has arrived at the <lb/>
            comprehension of those things which are appreciable only by <lb/>
            the intellect; and by the motion of the body, it has attained to <lb/>
            an understanding of those things which are perceptible by the <lb/>
            outward senses ; therefore, if any one is unable altogether to <lb/>
            associate with the mind alone, he then finds for himself a <lb/>
            second refuge, namely, the external senses; and whoever fails <lb/>
            in attaining to a comprehension of the things which are intel­ <lb/>
            ligible only by the intellect is immediately drawn over to the <lb/>
            objects of the outward senses; for the second organ is always <lb/>
            to the outward senses, in the case of those things which are <lb/>
            not able to make a successful one as far as the dominant mind. <lb/>
            But it is well for man not to grow old or to spend all his time <lb/>
            in this course either, but rather, as if they were straying in a <lb/>
            foreign country like sojourners, to be always seeking for second <lb/>
            migration, and for a return to their native land.</p>
          <p>Therefore Laban, knowing absolutely nothing of either <lb/>
            species or genus, or form, or conception, or of anything else <lb/>
            whatever which is comprehended by the intellect alone, and <lb/>
            depending solely on what lies externally visible, and such <lb/>
             <pb n="302"/>
            things as come under the notice of the eyes, and the ears, and <lb/>
            the other hundred faculties, is thought worthy of Charran for <lb/>
            his country, which Jacob, the lover of virtue, inhabits as a foreign <lb/>
            land for a short time, always bearing in his recollection his <lb/>
            return homewards ; therefore his mother, perseverance, that is <lb/>
            Rebecca, says to him, " Rise up and flee to Laban, my brother, <lb/>
            to Charran, and dwell with him certain days."* Do you not <lb/>
            perceive then that the practiser of virtue will not endure to <lb/>
            live permanently in the country of the outward senses, but only <lb/>
            to remain there a few days and a short time, on account of the <lb/>
            necessities of the body to which he is bound ? But a longer <lb/>
            time and an entire life is allotted to him in the city which is <lb/>
            appreciable only by the intellect.</p>
          <p>IX. In reference to which fact, also, it appears to me to be <lb/>
            that his grandfather also, by name Abraham, so called from <lb/>
            his knowledge, would not endure to remain any great length <lb/>
            of time in Charran, for it is said in the scriptures that <lb/>
            " Abraham was seventy-five years old when he departed from <lb/>
            Charran ; " t although his father Terah, which name being <lb/>
            interpreted means, the investigation of a smell, lived there till <lb/>
            the day of his cleath.‡ Therefore it is expressly stated in the <lb/>
            sacred scriptures that "Terah died in Charran," for he was <lb/>
            only a reconnoitrer of virtue, not a citizen. And he availed <lb/>
            himself of smells, and not of the enjoyments of food, as he was <lb/>
            not able as yet to fill himself with wisdom, nor indeed even to <lb/>
            get a taste of it, but only to smell it; for as it is said that <lb/>
            those dogs which are calculated for hunting can by exerting their <lb/>
            faculty of smell, find out the lurking places of their game at a <lb/>
            great distance, being by nature rendered wonderfully acute as <lb/>
            to the outward sense of smell; so in the same manner the lover <lb/>
            of instruction tracks out the sweet breeze which is given forth <lb/>
            by justice, and by any other virtue, and is eager to watch <lb/>
            those qualities from which this most admirable source of <lb/>
            delight proceeds, and while he is unable to do so he moves <lb/>
            his head all round in a circle, smelling out nothing else, but <lb/>
            seeking only for that most sacred scent of excellence and food, <lb/>
            for he does not deny that he is eager for knowledge and <lb/>
            wisdom.</p>
          <p>Blessed therefore are they to whom it has happened to enjoy <lb/>
            the delights of wisdom, and to feast upon its speculations and <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xxvii. 43. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Genesis xii. 4. </note> <note type="footnote"> ‡ Genesis xvii. 32. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="303"/>
            doctrines, and even of the being cheered by them still to thirst <lb/>
            for more, feeling an insatiable and inceasing desire for <lb/>
            knowledge. And those will obtain the second place who are <lb/>
            not allured indeed to enjoy the sacred table, but who never­ <lb/>
            theless refresh their souls with its odours ; for they will be <lb/>
            excited by the fragrances of virtue like those languid invalids <lb/>
            who, because they are not as yet able to take solid food. <lb/>
            nevertheless feed on the smell of such viands as the sons <lb/>
            of the physicians prepare as a sort of remedy for their <lb/>
            impotency.</p>
          <p>X. Therefore, having left the land of the Chaldæans, Terah is <lb/>
            said to have migrated to Charran ; bringing with him his son <lb/>
            Abraham and the rest of his household who agreed with him <lb/>
            in opinion, not in order that we might read in the account of <lb/>
            the historical chronicles that some men had become emigrants, <lb/>
            leaving their native country and becoming inhabitants of a <lb/>
            foreign land as if it were their own country, but in order that <lb/>
            a lesson of the greatest importance to life and full of wisdom, <lb/>
            and adapted to man alone, might not be neglected.</p>
          <p>And what is the lesson ? The Chaldæans are great astro­ <lb/>
            nomers, and the inhabitants of Charran occupy themselves <lb/>
            with the topics relating to the external senses. Therefore the <lb/>
            sacred account says to the investigator of the things of nature, <lb/>
            why are you inquiring about the sun, and asking whether he <lb/>
            is a foot broad, whether he is greater than the whole earth <lb/>
            put together, or whether he is even many times as large ? <lb/>
            And why are you investigating the causes of the light of the <lb/>
            moon, and whether it has a borrowed light, or one which <lb/>
            proceeds solely from itself? Why, again, do you seek to under­ <lb/>
            stand the nature of the rest of the stars, of their motion, of <lb/>
            their sympathy with one another, and even with earthly things ? <lb/>
            And why, while walking upon the earth do you soar above the <lb/>
            clouds ? And why, while rooted in the solid land, do you affirm <lb/>
            that you can reach the things in the sky ? And why do you <lb/>
            endeavour to form conjectures about matters which cannot be <lb/>
            ascertained by conjecture ? And why do you busy yourself <lb/>
            about sublime subjects which you ought not to meddle with ? <lb/>
            And why do you extend your desire to make discoveries in <lb/>
            mathematical science as far as the heaven ? And why do you <lb/>
            devote yourself to astronomy, and talk about nothing but high <lb/>
            subjects? My good man, do not trouble your head about <lb/>
             <pb n="304"/>
            things beyond the ocean, but attend only to what is near you; <lb/>
            and be content rather to examine yourself without flattery.</p>
          <p>How, then, will you find out what you want, even if you are <lb/>
            successful ? Go with full exercise of your intellect to Charran, <lb/>
            that is, to the trench which is duct, into the holes and caverns <lb/>
            of the body, and investigate the eyes, the ears, the nostrils, <lb/>
            and the other organs of the external senses ; and if you wish to <lb/>
            be a philosopher, study philosophically that branch which is <lb/>
            the most indispensable and at the same time the most <lb/>
            becoming to a man, and inquire what the faculty of sight is, <lb/>
            what hearing is, what taste, what smell, what touch is, in a <lb/>
            word, what is external sense; then seek to understand what it <lb/>
            is to see, and how you see; what it is to hear, and how you <lb/>
            hear; what it is to smell, or to taste, or to touch, and how <lb/>
            each of these operations is ordinarily effected. But is it not <lb/>
            the very extravagance of insane folly to seek to comprehend <lb/>
            the dwelling of the universe, before your own private dwelling <lb/>
            is accurately known to you ? But I do not as yet lay the <lb/>
            more important and extensive injunction upon you to make <lb/>
            yourself acquainted with your own soul and mind, of the know­ <lb/>
            ledge of which you are so proud; for in reality you will never <lb/>
            be able to comprehend it.</p>
          <p>Mount up then to heaven, and talk arrogantly about the <lb/>
            things which exist there, before you are as yet able to compre­ <lb/>
            bend, according to the words of the poet, <lb/>
            " All the good and all the evil <lb/>
            Which thy own abode contains;" <lb/>
            and, bringing down that messenger of yours from heaven, and <lb/>
            dragging him down from his search into matters existing <lb/>
            there, become acquainted with yourself, and carefully and <lb/>
            diligently labour to arrive at such happiness as is permitted to <lb/>
            man. Now this disposition the Hebrews called Terah, and the <lb/>
            Greeks Socrates; for they say also that the latter grew old in <lb/>
            the most accurate study by which he could hope to know him­ <lb/>
            self, never once directing his philosophical speculations to the <lb/>
            subjects beyond himself. But he was really a man ; but Terah <lb/>
            is the principle itself which is proposed to every one, according <lb/>
            to which each man should know himself, like a tree full of <lb/>
            good branches, in order that these persons who are fond of <lb/>
            virtue might without difficulty gather the fruit of pure morality, <lb/>
             <pb n="305"/>
            and thus become filled with the most delightful and saving <lb/>
            food.</p>
          <p>Such, then, are those men who reconnoitre the quarters of <lb/>
            wisdom for us; but those who are actually her athletes, and <lb/>
            who practise her exercises, are more perfect. For these men <lb/>
            think fit to learn with complete accuracy the whole question <lb/>
            connected with the external senses, and after having done so, <lb/>
            then to proceed to another and more important speculation, <lb/>
            leaving all consideration of the holes of the body which they <lb/>
            call Charran. Of the number of these men is Abraham, who <lb/>
            attained to great progress and improvement in the comprehen­ <lb/>
            sion of complete knowledge ; for when he knew most, then he <lb/>
            most completely renounced himself in order to attain to <lb/>
            the accurate knowledge of him who was the truly living <lb/>
            God. And, indeed, this is a very natural course of events ; for <lb/>
            he who completely understands himself does also very much, <lb/>
            because of his thorough appreciation of it, renounce the uni­ <lb/>
            versal nothingness of the creature; and he who renounces <lb/>
            himself learns to comprehend the living God.</p>
          <p>XI. We have now, then, explained what Charran is, and <lb/>
            why he who left the well of the oath came thither. We must <lb/>
            now consider the third point which comes next in order, <lb/>
            namely, what the place is to which this man came ; for it is <lb/>
            said, " He met him in the place."* Now place is considered <lb/>
            in three ways : firstly, as a situation filled by a body; secondly, <lb/>
            as the divine word which God himself has filled wholly and <lb/>
            entirely with incorporeal powers; for says the scripture, "I <lb/>
            have seen the place in which the God of Israel stood,"† in <lb/>
            which alone he permitted his prophet to perform sacrifice to <lb/>
            him, forbidding him to do so in other places. For he is <lb/>
            ordered to go up into the place which the Lord God shall <lb/>
            choose, and there to sacrifice burnt offerings and sacrifices for <lb/>
            salvation, and to bring other victims also without spot.</p>
          <p>According to the third signification, God himself is called a <lb/>
            place, from the fact of his surrounding the universe, and being <lb/>
            surrounded himself by nothing whatever, and from the fact of <lb/>
            his being the refuge of all persons, and since he himself is his <lb/>
            own district, containing himself and resembling himself <lb/>
            alone. I, indeed, am not a place, but I am in a place, and <lb/>
            every existing being is so in a similar manner. So that which <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xxviii. 11. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Exodus xxiv. 10. </note> <note type="footnote"> VOL. II. </note> <note type="footnote"> x </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="306"/>
            is surrounded differs from that which surrounds it; but the <lb/>
            Deity, being surrounded by nothing, is necessarily itself its own <lb/>
            place. And there is an evidence in support of my view of the <lb/>
            matter in the following sacred oracle delivered with respect to <lb/>
            Abraham : " He came unto the place of which the Lord God <lb/>
            had told him: and having looked up with his eyes, he saw <lb/>
            the place afar off."*</p>
          <p>Tell me, now, did he who had come to the place see it afar <lb/>
            off? Or perhaps it is but an identical expression for two <lb/>
            different things, one of which is the divine world, and the <lb/>
            other, God, who existed before the world. But he who was <lb/>
            conducted by wisdom comes to the former place, having <lb/>
            found that the main part and end of propitiation is the <lb/>
            divine word, in which he who is fixed does not as yet attain to <lb/>
            such a height as to penetrate to the essence of God, but sees <lb/>
            him afar off: or, rather, I should say, he is not able even to <lb/>
            behold him afar off, but he only discerns this fact, that God is at <lb/>
            a distance from every creature, and that any comprehension <lb/>
            of him is removed to a great distance from all human intellect. <lb/>
            Perhaps, however, the historian, by this allegorical form of <lb/>
            expression, does not here mean by his expression, " place," the <lb/>
            Cause of all things; but the idea which he intends to convey <lb/>
            may be something of this sort ;-he came to the place, and <lb/>
            looking up with his eyes he saw the very place to which he <lb/>
            had come, which was a very long way from the God who may <lb/>
            not be named nor spoken of, and who is in every way incom­ <lb/>
            prehensible.</p>
          <p>XII. These things, then. being defined as a necessary pre­ <lb/>
            liminary, when the practiser of virtue comes to Charran, the <lb/>
            outward sense, he does not " meet" the place, nor that place <lb/>
            either which is filled by a mortal body ; for all those who are <lb/>
            born of the dust, and who occupy any place whatever, and who <lb/>
            do of necessity fill some position, partake of that; nor the <lb/>
            third and most excellent kind of place, of which it was scarcely <lb/>
            possible for that man to form an idea who made his abode at <lb/>
            the well which was entitled the " well of the oath," where <lb/>
            the self-taught race, Isaac, abides, who never abandons his <lb/>
            faith in God and his .invisible comprehension of him, but who <lb/>
            keeps to the intermediate divine word, which affords him the <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xxii. 4. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="307"/>
            best suggestions, and teaches him everything which is suit­ <lb/>
            able to the times.</p>
          <p>For God, not condescending to come down to the external <lb/>
            senses, sends his own words or angels for the sake of giving <lb/>
            assistance to' those who love virtue. But they attend like <lb/>
            physicians to the diseases of the soul, and apply themselves to <lb/>
            heal them, offering sacred recommendations like sacred laws, <lb/>
            and inviting men to practise the duties inculcated by them, <lb/>
            and, like the trainers of wrestlers, implanting in their pupils <lb/>
            strength, and power, and irresistible vigour. Very properly, <lb/>
            therefore, when he has arrived at the external sense, he is <lb/>
            represented no longer as meeting God, but only the divine <lb/>
            word, just as his grandfather Abraham, the model of wisdom, <lb/>
            did; for the scripture tells us, "The Lord departed when he <lb/>
            had finished conversing with Abraham, and Abraham returned <lb/>
            to his place."*</p>
          <p>From which expression it is inferred, that he also met with <lb/>
            the sacred words from which God, the father of the universe, <lb/>
            had previously departed, no longer displaying visions from <lb/>
            himself but only those which proceed from his subordinate <lb/>
            powers. And it is with exceeding beauty and propriety that it <lb/>
            is said, not that he came to the place, but that he met the <lb/>
            place: for to come is voluntary, but to meet is very often <lb/>
            involuntary; so that the divine Word appearing on a sudden, <lb/>
            supplies an unexpected jov, greater than could have been <lb/>
            hoped, inasmuch as it is about to travel in company with the <lb/>
            solitary soul ; for Moses also " brings forward the people to a <lb/>
            meeting with God,"t well knowing that he comes invisibly <lb/>
            towards those souls who have a longing to meet with him.</p>
          <p>XIII. And he subsequently alleges a reason why he " met <lb/>
            the place for, says he, " the sun was set."‡ Not meaning the <lb/>
            sun which appears to us, but the most brilliant and radiant <lb/>
            light of the invisible and Almighty God. When this light <lb/>
            shines upon the mind, the inferior beams of words (that is of <lb/>
            angels) set. And much more are all the places perceptible by <lb/>
            the external senses overshadowed ; but when he departs in a <lb/>
            different direction, then they all rise and shine. And do not <lb/>
            wonder if, according to the rules of allegorical description, the <lb/>
            sun is likened to the Father and Governor of the universe ; <lb/>
            for in reality nothing is like unto God ; but those things <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xviii. 33. </note> <note type="footnote"> + Exodus xix. 17. </note> <note type="footnote"> ‡ Genesis xxviii. 11. </note> <note type="footnote"> x 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="308"/>
            which by the vain opinion of men are thought to be so, are only <lb/>
            two things, one invisible and the other visible ; the soul being <lb/>
            the invisible thing, and the sun the visible one.</p>
          <p>Now he has shown the similitude of the soul in another <lb/>
            passage, where he says, " God made man, in the image of God <lb/>
            created he him." And again, in the law enacted against homi­ <lb/>
            cides, he says, " Whoso sheddeth man's blood, by man shall <lb/>
            his blood be shed in requital for that blood, because in the <lb/>
            image of God did I make him."* But the likeness of the sun <lb/>
            he only indicates by symbols. And it is easy otherwise by <lb/>
            means of argument to perceive this, since God is the first light, <lb/>
            " For the Lord is my light and my Saviour," t is the lan­ <lb/>
            guage of the Psalms; and not only the light, but he is also the <lb/>
            archetypal pattern of every other light, or rather he is more <lb/>
            ancient and more sublime than even the archetypal model, <lb/>
            though he is spoken of as the model; for the real model was <lb/>
            his own most perfect word, the light, and he himself is like to <lb/>
            no created thing. Since, as the sun divides day and night, so <lb/>
            also does Moses say that God divided the light from the dark­ <lb/>
            ness ; for " God made a division between the light and between <lb/>
            the darkness."‡</p>
          <p>And besides all this, as the sun, when he arises, discovers <lb/>
            hidden things, so also does God, who created all things, not <lb/>
            only bring them all to light, but he has even created what <lb/>
            before had no existence, not being only their maker, but also <lb/>
            their founder.</p>
          <p>XIV. And the sun is also spoken of in many passages of <lb/>
            holy writ in a figurative manner. Once as the human mind, <lb/>
            which men build up as a city § and furnish, who are com­ <lb/>
            pelled to serve the creature in preference to the uncreated <lb/>
            God, of whom it is said that, " They built strong cities for <lb/>
            Pharaoh and Peitho,"§ that is, for discourse; to which per­ <lb/>
            suasion (<foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸ πείθειν</foreign>) is attributed, and Rameses, or the out­ <lb/>
            ward sense, by which the soul is devoured as if by moths ; <lb/>
            for the name Rameses, being interpreted, means, " the <lb/>
            shaking of a moth ;" and On, the mind, which they called Heli­ <lb/>
            opolis, since the mind, like the sun, has the predominance <lb/>
            over the whole mass of our body, and extends its powers like <lb/>
            the beams of the sun, over everything. <note type="footnote"> * Genesis ix. 6. </note><note type="footnote"> § Genesis xi. 4. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Psalm xxvi. 1. </note><note type="footnote"> || Exodus i. 11. </note> <note type="footnote"> ‡ Genesis i. 4. </note> <pb n="309"/>
            </p>
          <p>But he who appropriates to himself the regulation of cor­ <lb/>
            poreal things, by name Joseph, takes the priest and minister <lb/>
            of the mind to be his father-in law; for says the scripture, <lb/>
            " he gave him Aseneth, the daughter of Peutephres, the <lb/>
            priest of Heliopolis, for his wife."* And, using symbolical <lb/>
            language, he calls the outward sense a second sun, inasmuch <lb/>
            as it shows all the objects of which it is able to form a judg­ <lb/>
            ment to the intellect, concerning which he speaks thus, " The <lb/>
            sun rose upon him when he passed by the appearance of <lb/>
            God."† For in real truth, when we are no longer able to <lb/>
            endure to pass all cur time with the most sacred appearances, and <lb/>
            as it were with incorporeal images, but when we turn aside in <lb/>
            another direction, and forsake them, we use another light, <lb/>
            that, namely, in accordance with the external sense, which in <lb/>
            real truth, is in no respect different from darkness, which, after <lb/>
            it has arisen, arouses as if from sleep the senses of seeing, <lb/>
            and of hearing, and also of taste, and of touch, and of smell, <lb/>
            and sends to sleep the intellectual qualities of prudence, and <lb/>
            justice, and knowledge, and wisdom, which were all awake.</p>
          <p>And it is for this reason that the sacred scripture says, that <lb/>
            no one can be pure before the evening,‡ as the disorderly <lb/>
            motions of the outward senses agitate and confuse the in­ <lb/>
            tellect Moreover, he establishes a law for the priests also <lb/>
            which may not be avoided, combining with it an expression of <lb/>
            a grave opinion when it says, " He shall not eat of the holy <lb/>
            things unless he have washed his body in water, and unless <lb/>
            the sun has set, and he has become pure."§ For by these <lb/>
            words it is very clearly shown that there is no one whatever <lb/>
            completely pure, so as to be fit to be initiated into the holy <lb/>
            and sacred mysteries, to whose lot it has fallen to be honoured <lb/>
            with these glories of life which are appreciable by the external <lb/>
            senses. But if any one rejects these glories, he is deservedly <lb/>
            made conspicuous by the light of wisdom, by means of which <lb/>
            he will be able to wash off the stains of vain opinion and to <lb/>
            become pure.</p>
          <p>Do you not see that even the sun itself produces opposite <lb/>
            effects when he is setting from those which he causes when <lb/>
            rising ? For when he rises everything upon the earth shines, <lb/>
            and the things in heaven are hidden from our view ; but, on <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xli. 45. </note><note type="footnote"> ‡ Leviticus iv. 31. </note> <note type="footnote"> † Genesis xxxii. 31. </note><note type="footnote"> § Leviticus xxii. 6. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="310"/>
            the other hand, when be sets then the stars appear and the <lb/>
            things on earth are overshadowed. In the same manner, <lb/>
            also, in us, when the light of the outward senses rises like <lb/>
            the sun, the celestial and heavenly sciences are really and <lb/>
            truly hidden from view; but when this light is near setting, <lb/>
            then the starlike radiance of the virtues appears, when the <lb/>
            mind is pure, and concealed by no object of the outward <lb/>
            senses.</p>
          <p>XV. But according to the third signification, when he <lb/>
            speaks of the sun, he means the divine word, the model <lb/>
            of that sun which moves about through the heaven, as has <lb/>
            been said before, and with respect to which it is said, "The <lb/>
            sun went forth upon the earth, and Lot entered into Segor, <lb/>
            and the Lord rained upon Sodom and Gomorrah brimstone and <lb/>
            fire." For the word of God, when it reaches to our earthly <lb/>
            constitution, assists and protects those who are akin to virtue, <lb/>
            or whose inclinations lead them to virtue; so that it provides <lb/>
            them with a complete refuge and salvation, but upon their <lb/>
            enemies it sends irremediable overthrow and destruction.</p>
          <p>And in the fourth signification, what is meant by the sun is <lb/>
            the God and ruler of the universe himself, as 1 have said <lb/>
            already, by means of whom such offences as are irremediable, <lb/>
            and which appear to be overshadowed and concealed, are <lb/>
            revealed ; for as all things are possible, so, likewise, all things <lb/>
            are known to God.</p>
          <p>In reference to which faculty of his it is that he drags those <lb/>
            persons who are living dissolutely as regards their souls, and <lb/>
            who are in a debauched and intemperate manner, cohabiting <lb/>
            with the daughters of the mind the outward senses, as pros­ <lb/>
            titutes and harlots, to the light of the sun, in order to display <lb/>
            their true characters; for the scripture says, " And the people <lb/>
            abode in Shittim ;" now the meaning of the name Shittim is, <lb/>
            " the thorns of the passions" which sting and wound the soul. <lb/>
            " And the people was polluted, and began to commit whoredom <lb/>
            with the daughters of Moab,"† and these who are called <lb/>
            daughters are the outward senses, for the name Moab is <lb/>
            interpreted, " of a father;" and the scripture adds, " Take all <lb/>
            the chiefs of the people, and make an example of them unto <lb/>
            the Lord in the face of the sun, and the anger of the Lord <lb/>
            shall be turned from Israel."‡ For he not only desires that the <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xix. 23. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Numbers xxr. 1. </note> <note type="footnote"> ‡ lumbers xxv. 4, </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="311"/>
            wicked deeds which are hidden shall he made manifest, and <lb/>
            therefore turns upon them the beams of the sun, but he also <lb/>
            by this symbolical language calls the father of the universe the <lb/>
            sun, that being by whom all things are seen beforehand, and <lb/>
            even all those things which are invisibly concealed in the <lb/>
            recesses of the mind; and when they are made manifest, then <lb/>
            he promises that he who is the only merciful being, will <lb/>
            become merciful to the people. Why so ? Because, even if <lb/>
            the mind, fancying that though it does wrong it can escape the <lb/>
            notice of the Deity as not being able to see everything, should <lb/>
            sill secretly and in dark places, and should after that, either by <lb/>
            reason of its own notions or through the suggestions of some <lb/>
            one else, conceive that it is impossible that anything should be <lb/>
            otherwise than clear to God, and should disclose itself and all <lb/>
            its actions, and should bring them forward, as it were, out of <lb/>
            the light of the sun, and display them to the governor of the <lb/>
            universe, saying, that it repents of the perverse conduct which <lb/>
            it formerly exhibited when under the influence of foolish <lb/>
            opinion (for that nothing is indistinct before God, but all <lb/>
            things are known and clear to him, not merely such as have <lb/>
            been done, but even such are merely hoped or designed, by <lb/>
            reason of the boundless character of his wisdom), it then is <lb/>
            purified and benefited, and it propitiates the chastiser who <lb/>
            was ready to punish it, namely, conscience, who was previously <lb/>
            filled with just anger towards it, and who now admits repent­ <lb/>
            ance as the younger brother of perfect innocence and freedom <lb/>
            from sin.</p>
          <p>XVI. Moreover, it appears that Moses has in other passages <lb/>
            also taken the sun as a symbol of the great Cause of all things, <lb/>
            of which I see an instance in the law which is enacted with <lb/>
            respect to those who borrow on pledges : let us recite the law, <lb/>
            " If thou takest as a pledge the garment of thy neighbour, <lb/>
            thou shalt give it back before the setting of the sun: for it is <lb/>
            his covering, it is the only covering of his nakedness, in which <lb/>
            he lies down. If he cries unto me I will hearken unto him, <lb/>
            for I am merciful."* Is it not natural that those who fancy <lb/>
            that the lawgiver displays such earnestness about a garment <lb/>
            should, if they do not reproach him, at least make a suggestion, <lb/>
            saying, "What are ye saying, my good men? Do ye affirm <lb/>
            that the Creator and ruler of the world calls himself merciful <note type="footnote"> * Exodus xxii. 26. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="312"/>
            with respect to so trivial a matter, as that of a garment not <lb/>
            being restored to the borrower by the lender?" These are the <lb/>
            opinions and notions of men who have never had the least <lb/>
            conception or comprehension of the virtue of the almighty <lb/>
            God, and who, contrary to all human and divine law, impart <lb/>
            the triviality of human affairs to the uncreate and immortal <lb/>
            nature, which is full of happiness, and blessedness, and per­ <lb/>
            fection ; for in what respect do those lenders act unreasonably, <lb/>
            who retain in their own hands the pledges which are deposited <lb/>
            with them as security, until they receive back their own which <lb/>
            they have lent? The debtors are poor, some one will perhaps <lb/>
            say, and it is right to pity them : would it not then have been <lb/>
            reasonable and better to enact a law in accordance with which <lb/>
            a contribution should be made to assist their necessities, rather <lb/>
            than allow them to appear as debtors, or else one which should <lb/>
            forbid the lending on pledges at all ?</p>
          <p>But the law which has permitted the lending on pledges, <lb/>
            cannot fairly be indignant against those who will not give up <lb/>
            the pledges which they have received before the proper time, <lb/>
            as if they were acting unjustly.</p>
          <p>But if any one having come, so to say, to the very farthest <lb/>
            limits of poverty, and, being clothed in rags, loads himself <lb/>
            with new debts, neglecting the pity which he receives from the <lb/>
            bystanders, which is freely bestowed, upon those who fall into <lb/>
            such misfortunes, in their own houses, and in the temples, and <lb/>
            in the market-place, and everywhere; such an one brings and <lb/>
            offers to his creditor, the only covering which he had for <lb/>
            his shame, with which he has been wont to cover the secret <lb/>
            parts of his nature, as a pledge for something. For what, I <lb/>
            pray ? Is it for some other and better garment? For no one <lb/>
            is unprovided with necessary food as long as the springs of the <lb/>
            rivers bubble up, and the torrents flow abundantly, and the <lb/>
            earth gives forth its annual fruits.</p>
          <p>Again, is any creditor so covetous of riches, or so very cruel, <lb/>
            or so perverse, as not to be willing to contribute a tetradrachm, <lb/>
            or even less, to one in distress ? Or is anyone so stingy as to <lb/>
            be willing to lend it, but to refuse to give it ? or as to take <lb/>
            the only garment that the poor man has as a pledge ? which <lb/>
            indeed under another name may fairly be called running away <lb/>
            with a man's clothes for men who do this are accustomed to <note type="footnote"> * The Greek word is <foreign xml:lang="grc">λωποδυτέω</foreign>. A <foreign xml:lang="grc">λωποδύτης</foreign> was one who </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="313"/>
            put on other peoples' clothes, and steal them, and to leave the <lb/>
            proper owners naked.</p>
          <p>And why has the law provided so carefully that the debtor <lb/>
            may not be without his clothes by night, and that he may not <lb/>
            lie down to sleep without them, but has not paid the same <lb/>
            attention to the fact of his being indecorously naked by day ? <lb/>
            Are not all things concealed by night and darkness, so as to <lb/>
            cause less shame, or rather none at all at that time, but are <lb/>
            they not disclosed by day and by light, so as then to compel <lb/>
            persons to blush more freely ? And why does the law not use <lb/>
            the expression "to give," but "to restore?" For restoration <lb/>
            takes place with respect to the property of other persons, but <lb/>
            pledges belong rather to those who have lent on them than to <lb/>
            those who have borrowed on them. Moreover, do you not <lb/>
            perceive that the law has not enjoined the debtor, who has <lb/>
            received back his garment that it may serve as bed-clothes, to <lb/>
            bring it back again to his creditor at the return of daylight ? <lb/>
            And, indeed, if the exact propriety of the language be con­ <lb/>
            sidered, even the most stupid person may see that there is <lb/>
            something additional meant beyond what is formally expressed. <lb/>
            For the injunction rather resembles a maxim than a re­ <lb/>
            commendation. For, if a person had been giving a re­ <lb/>
            commendation, he would have said: " Give back to your <lb/>
            debtor, at the approach of evening, the garment which has <lb/>
            been pledged to you, if it be the only garment that he is <lb/>
            possessed of, that he may have something with which to cover <lb/>
            himself at night." But one who was laying down a maxim <lb/>
            would speak thus; as indeed the law does here, " For it is his <lb/>
            garment, the only covering of his nakedness, in which he will <lb/>
            lie down to sleep</p>
          <p>XVII. These things then, and other things of the same <lb/>
            kind, may be urged in reply to those assertors of the literal <lb/>
            sense of a passage; and who superciliously reject all other <lb/>
            explanations. We will now, in accordance with the usual laws <lb/>
            of allegorical speaking, say what is becoming with respect to <lb/>
            these subjects.</p>
          <p>We say, therefore, that a garment is here spoken of <lb/>
            symbolically, to signify speech; for clothes keep off the injuries <lb/>
            which are wont to visit the body, from cold and heat, and they <note type="footnote"> frequented the baths for the purpose of stealing the clothes of the <lb/>
            bathers. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="314"/>
            also conceal the unmentionable parts of nature, and moreover, <lb/>
            a cloak is a fitting garment for the body. In much the same <lb/>
            manner, speech has been given to man by God, as the most <lb/>
            excellent of gifts ; for in the first place, it is a defensive weapo: <lb/>
            against those who-would attack him with innovations. For as <lb/>
            nature has fortified all other animals with their own appro­ <lb/>
            priate and peculiar means of defence, by which they are able to <lb/>
            repel those who attempt to injure them, so also has it bestowed <lb/>
            upon man that greatest defence and most impregnable pro­ <lb/>
            tection of speech, with which, as with a panoply, every one who is <lb/>
            completely clothed, will have a domestic and most appropriate <lb/>
            bodyguard ; and employing it as a champion, will be able <lb/>
            to ward off all the injuries which can be brought against him <lb/>
            by his enemies.</p>
          <p>In the second place, it is a most necessary defence "against <lb/>
            shame and reproach; for speech is very well calculated to <lb/>
            conceal and obscure the faults of men.</p>
          <p>In the third place, it conduces to the whole ornament of <lb/>
            life : for this is the thing which improves every one, and which <lb/>
            conducts every one to what is best; for there are many <lb/>
            disgraceful and mischievous men, who take conversation as a <lb/>
            pledge, and deprive its proper owners of it, and utterly cut off <lb/>
            what they ought to seek to increase; like men who ravage <lb/>
            the lands of their enemies, and who attempt to destroy their <lb/>
            corn and all the rest of their crops, which, if it were left unhurt, <lb/>
            would be a great advantage to those who would use it.</p>
          <p>For some men carry on an irreconcilable and never-ending <lb/>
            war against rational nature, and utterly extirpate its every shoot <lb/>
            and beginning, and destroy all its first appearances of propa­ <lb/>
            gation, and render it, as one may say, utterly unproductive and <lb/>
            barren of all good practices. For sometimes, when it is borne <lb/>
            onwards towards sacred instruction with irresistible impetuosity, <lb/>
            and when it is smitten with a love of the speculations of <lb/>
            true philosophy, they-out of jealousy and envy, fearing lest, <lb/>
            when it has derived strength from its noble aspirations and <lb/>
            has been elevated to a splendid height, it may overwhelm all <lb/>
            their petty cavils and plausible devices against the truth, like <lb/>
            an irresistible torrent-turn its energy in another direction by <lb/>
            their own evil artifices, guiding it in another channel to vulgar <lb/>
            and illiberal acts: and very often they seek to blunt it or to <lb/>
            hedge it in, and in this way leave the nobility of its nature <lb/>
             <pb n="315"/>
            uncultivated, just as at times wicked guardians of orphan <lb/>
            children have rendered a deep-soiled and fertile land barren.</p>
          <p>And these most pitiless of all men have not been restrained <lb/>
            by shame from stripping the man of his only garment, namely, <lb/>
            speech; " For," says the scripture, " it is his only covering."- <lb/>
            What is a man's only covering, except speech? For, as <lb/>
            neighing is the peculiar attribute of a horse, and barking of a <lb/>
            do-, and lowing of an ox, and roaring of a lion, so also is <lb/>
            speaking, and speech itself, the peculiar property of man: for <lb/>
            this is what man has received above all other animals as his <lb/>
            peculiar gift, as a protection, and bulwark, and panoply, and wall <lb/>
            of defence ; he being, of all living creatures, the most beloved <lb/>
            by God.</p>
          <p>XVIII. On which account the scripture adds, " This is the <lb/>
            only covering of his nakedness;" for what can so becomingly <lb/>
            overshadow and conceal the reproaches and disgraces of life, <lb/>
            as speech? For ignorance is a disgrace akin to irrational <lb/>
            nature, but education is the brother of speech, and an orna­ <lb/>
            ment properly belonging to man. In what then will a man <lb/>
            lie down to rest ? That is to say, in what will a man find <lb/>
            tranquillity and a respite from his labours, except in speech? <lb/>
            For speech is a relief to our most miserable and afflicted race ? <lb/>
            As therefore, when men have been overwhelmed by grief, or by <lb/>
            fear, or by any other evil, tranquillity, and constancy, and the <lb/>
            kindness of friends have often restored them; so it happens, not <lb/>
            often, but invariably, that speech, the only real averter of evil, <lb/>
            wards off that most heavy burden which the necessities of that <lb/>
            body in the which we are bound up, and the unforeseen <lb/>
            accidents of external circumstances which attack us, impose <lb/>
            upon us; for speech is a friend, and an acquaintance, and a <lb/>
            kinsman, and a companion bound up within us; I should <lb/>
            rather say, fitted close and united to us by some indissoluble <lb/>
            and invisible cement of nature.</p>
          <p>On this account it is, that it forewarns us of what will be <lb/>
            expedient for us, and when any unexpected event befalls us it <lb/>
            comes forward of its own accord to assist us ; not only bringing <lb/>
            advantage of one kind only, such as that which he who is an <lb/>
            adviser without acting, or an agent who can give no advice, <lb/>
            may supply, but of both kinds: for he does not display a half­ <lb/>
            complete power, but one which is perfect in every part. <lb/>
            Inasmuch, as even if it were to fail in his endeavour, and <lb/>
             <pb n="316"/>
            in any conceptions which may have been formed, or efforts <lb/>
            which may have been made, it still can have recourse to the <lb/>
            third species of assistance, namely, consolation.</p>
          <p>For speech is, as it were, a medicine for the wounds of the <lb/>
            soul, and a saving remedy for its passions, which, " even before <lb/>
            the setting of the sun," the lawgiver says one must restore: <lb/>
            that is to say, before the all-brilliant beams of the almighty <lb/>
            and all-glorious God are obscured, which he, out of pity for our <lb/>
            race, sends down from heaven upon the human mind. For <lb/>
            while that most God-like light abides in the soul, we shall be <lb/>
            able to give back the speech, which was deposited as a pledge, <lb/>
            as if it were a garment, in order that he who has received this <lb/>
            peculiar possession of man, may by its means conceal the <lb/>
            discreditable circumstances of life, and reap the benefit of the <lb/>
            divine gift, and indulge in a respite combined with tranquillity, <lb/>
            in consequence of the presence of so useful an adviser and <lb/>
            defender, who will never leave the ranks in which he has been <lb/>
            stationed.</p>
          <p>Moreover, while God pours upon you the light of his beams, <lb/>
            do you hasten in the light of day to restore his pledge to the <lb/>
            Lord; for when the sun has set, then you, like the whole land <lb/>
            of Egypt,* will have an everlasting darkness which may be <lb/>
            felt, and being stricken with blindness and ignorance, you <lb/>
            will be deprived of all those things of which you thought that <lb/>
            you had certain possession, by that sharp-sighted Israel, whose <lb/>
            pledges you hold, having made one who was by nature exempt <lb/>
            from slavery a slave to necessity.</p>
          <p>XIX. We have discussed this subject at this length with <lb/>
            no other object except that of teaching that the mind, which is <lb/>
            inclined to practise virtue, having irregular motions towards <lb/>
            prolificness and sterility, and as one may say, being in a <lb/>
            manner always ascending and descending, when it becomes <lb/>
            prolific and is elevated to a height is illuminated with the <lb/>
            archetypal and incorporeal beams of the rational spring of the <lb/>
            all-perfecting sun; but when it descends and becomes unpro­ <lb/>
            ductive, then it is again illuminated by those images of those <lb/>
            beams, the immortal words which it is customary to call angels. <lb/>
            On which account we now read in the scripture, " He met the <lb/>
            place ; for the sun was set."t</p>
          <p>For when those beams of God desert the soul by means of <note type="footnote"> * Exodus x. 21. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Genesis xxviii. 2. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="317"/>
            which the clearest comprehensions of affairs are engendered in <lb/>
            it, then arises that second and weaker light of words, and the <lb/>
            light of things is no longer seen, just as is the case in this <lb/>
            lower world. For the moon, which occupies the second rank <lb/>
            next to the sun, when that body has set, pours forth a some­ <lb/>
            what weaker light than his upon the earth; and to meet a <lb/>
            place or a word is a most sufficient gift for those who cannot <lb/>
            discern that God is superior to every place or word; because <lb/>
            they have not a soul wholly destitute of light, but because, <lb/>
            since that most unmixed and brilliant light has set, they have <lb/>
            been favoured with one which is alloyed.</p>
          <p>"For the children of Israel had light in all their dwell­ <lb/>
            ings,"* says the sacred historian in the book of the Exodus, <lb/>
            so that night and darkness were continually banished from <lb/>
            them, though it is in night and darkness that those men <lb/>
            live who have lost the eyes of the soul rather than those of <lb/>
            the body, having no experience of the beams of virtue. But <lb/>
            some persons-supposing that what is meant here by the figura­ <lb/>
            tive expression of the sun is the external sense and the mind, <lb/>
            which are looked upon as the things which have the power of <lb/>
            judging ; and that what is meant by place is the divine word­ <lb/>
            understand the allegory in this manner: the practiser of <lb/>
            virtue met with the divine word, after the mortal and human <lb/>
            light had set; for as long as the mind thinks that it attains to <lb/>
            a firm comprehension of the objects of intellect, and the out­ <lb/>
            ward sense conceives that it has a similar understanding of its <lb/>
            appropriate objects, and that it dwells amid sublime objects, <lb/>
            the divine word stands aloof at a distance; but when each of <lb/>
            these comes to confess its own weakness, and sets in a manner <lb/>
            while availing itself of concealment, then immediately the <lb/>
            right reason of a soul well-practised in virtue comes in a wel­ <lb/>
            come manner to their assistance, when they have begun to <lb/>
            despair of their own strength, and await the aid which is invi­ <lb/>
            sibly coming to them from without.</p>
          <p>XX. Therefore, the scripture says in the next verses, " That <lb/>
            he took one of the stones of the place and placed it at his head, <lb/>
            and slept in that place."† Any one may wonder not only at <lb/>
            the interior and mystical doctrine contained in these words, <lb/>
            but also at the distinct assertion, which gives us a lesson in <note type="footnote"> * Exodus x. 23. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Genesis xxviii. 11. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="318"/>
            labour and endurance : for the historian does not think it <lb/>
            becoming, that the man who is devoted t) the study of virtue <lb/>
            should adopt a luxurious life, and live softly, imitating the <lb/>
            pursuits and rivalries of those who are called indeed happy, <lb/>
            but who are in reality full of all unhappiness; whose entire <lb/>
            life is a sleep and a dream, according to the holy lawgiver.</p>
          <p>These men, after they have during the whole day been doing <lb/>
            all sorts of injustice to others, in courts of justice, and council <lb/>
            halls, and theatres, and everywhere, then return home, like <lb/>
            miserable men as they are, to overturn their own house. <lb/>
            I mean not that house which comes under the class of buildings, <lb/>
            hut that which is akin to the soul, I mean the body. Intro­ <lb/>
            ducing immoderate and incessant food, and irrigating it with <lb/>
            an abundance of pure wine, until the reason is overwhelmed, <lb/>
            and disappears; and the passions which have their seat beneath <lb/>
            the belly, the offspring of satiety, rise up, being carried away <lb/>
            by unrestrained frenzy, and falling upon, and vehemently <lb/>
            attacking all that they meet with, are only at last appeased <lb/>
            after they have worked off their excessive violence of excitement.</p>
          <p>But by night, when it is time to turn towards rest, having <lb/>
            prepared costly couches and the most exquisite of beds, they <lb/>
            lie down in the most exceeding softness, imitating the luxury <lb/>
            of women, whom nature has permitted to indulge in a more <lb/>
            relaxed system of life, inasmuch as their maker, the Creator of <lb/>
            the universe, has made their bodies of a more delicate stamp. <lb/>
            Now no such person as this is a pupil of the sacred word, but <lb/>
            those only are the disciples of that who are real genuine men, <lb/>
            lovers of temperance, and orderliness, and modesty, men who <lb/>
            have laid down continence, and frugality, and fortitude, as a <lb/>
            kind of base and foundation for the whole of life; and safe <lb/>
            stations for the soul, in which it may anchor without danger <lb/>
            and without changeableness : for being superior to money, and <lb/>
            pleasure, and glory, they look down upon meats and drinks, <lb/>
            and everything of that sort, beyond what is necessary to ward <lb/>
            off hunger: being thoroughly ready to undergo hunger, and <lb/>
            thirst, and heat, and cold, and all other things, however hard <lb/>
            they may be to be borne, for the sake of the acquisition of <lb/>
            virtue. And being admirers of whatever is most easily pro­ <lb/>
            vided, so as not to be ashamed of ever such cheap or shabby <lb/>
            clothes, thinking rather, on the other hand, that sumptuous <lb/>
            apparel is a reproach and great scandal to life.</p><pb n="319"/>
            
          <p>To these men, the soft earth is their most costly couch; <lb/>
            their bed is bushes, and grass, and herbage, and a thick layer <lb/>
            of leaves; and the pillows for their, head are a few stones, or <lb/>
            any little mounds which happen to rise a little above the <lb/>
            surface of the plain.</p>
          <p>Such a life as this, is, by luxurious men, denominated a life <lb/>
            of hardship, but by those who live for virtue, it is called most <lb/>
            delightful; for it is well adapted, not for those who are called <lb/>
            men, but for those who really are such. Do you not see, that <lb/>
            even now, also, the sacred historian represents the practiser of <lb/>
            honourable pursuits, who abounds in all royal materials and <lb/>
            appointments, as sleeping on the ground, and using a stone for <lb/>
            his pillow; and a little further on, he speaks of him as asking <lb/>
            in his prayers for bread and a cloak, the necessary wealth of <lb/>
            nature ? like one who has at all times held in contempt, the <lb/>
            man who dwells among vain opinions, and who is inclined to <lb/>
            revile all those who are disposed to admire him ; this man is <lb/>
            the archetypal pattern of the soul which is devoted to the <lb/>
            practice of virtue, and an enemy of every effeminate person.</p>
          <p>XXI. Hitherto I have been uttering the praises of the <lb/>
            man devoted to labour and to virtue, as it occurred to me <lb/>
            naturally; but now we must examine what is symbolically <lb/>
            signified under the expressions made use of.</p>
          <p>Now it is well that we should know, that the divine place <lb/>
            and the sacred region are full of incorporeal intelligences ; and <lb/>
            these intelligences are immortal souls. Taking then one of <lb/>
            these intelligences, and selecting one of them according as it <lb/>
            appears to be the most excellent, this lover of virtue, of whom <lb/>
            we are speaking, applies it to our 'own mind, to it as to the <lb/>
            head of a united body; for, indeed, the mind is in a manner <lb/>
            the head of the soul; and he does this, using the pretext in­ <lb/>
            deed as if he were going to sleep, but, in reality, as being <lb/>
            about to rest upon the word of God, and to place the whole of <lb/>
            his life as the lightest possible burden upon it; and it lis <lb/>
            tens to him gladly, and receives the labourer in the paths of <lb/>
            virtue at first, as if he were going to become a disciple ; then <lb/>
            when he has shown his approbation of the dexterity of his <lb/>
            nature, he gives him his hand, like a gymnastic trainer, and <lb/>
            invites him to the gymnasia, and standing firmly, compels him <lb/>
            to wrestle with him, until he has rendered his strength so <lb/>
            great as to be irresistible, changing his ears by the divine influ­ <lb/>
             <pb n="320"/>
            ences into eyes, and calling this newly-modelled disposition <lb/>
            Israel, that is, the man who sees.*</p>
          <p>Then also he crowns him with the garland of victory. But <lb/>
            this garland has a singular and foreign, and, perhaps, not alto­ <lb/>
            gether a well-omened name, for it is called by the president of <lb/>
            the games torpor, for it is said, that the breadth became tor­ <lb/>
            pidt of all the rewards and of the proclamations of the heralds, <lb/>
            and of all those most wonderful prizes for pre-eminent excel­ <lb/>
            lence which are had in honour; for the soul which has <lb/>
            received a share of irresistible power, and which has been <lb/>
            made perfect in the contests of virtue, and which has arrived <lb/>
            at the very furthest limit of what is honourable, will never be <lb/>
            unduly elated or puffed up by arrogance, nor stand upon tip­ <lb/>
            toes, and boast as if it were well to make vast strides with <lb/>
            bare feet; but the breadth which was extended wide by <lb/>
            opinion, will become torpid and contracted, and then will vo­ <lb/>
            luntarily succumb and yield to tameness, so as being classed <lb/>
            in an inferior order to that of the incorporeal natures, it may <lb/>
            carry off the victory while appearing to be defeated; for it is <lb/>
            accounted a most honourable thing to yield the palm to those <lb/>
            who are superior to one's self, voluntarily rather than through <lb/>
            compulsion; for it is incredible how greatly the second prize <lb/>
            in this contest is superior in real dignity and importance to <lb/>
            the first prize in the others.</p>
          <p>XXII. Such then may be said, by way of preface, to the <lb/>
            discussion of that description of visions which are sent from <lb/>
            God. But it is time now to turn to the subject itself, and to <lb/>
            investigate, with accuracy, every portion of it.</p>
          <p>The scripture therefore says, " And he dreamed a dream. <lb/>
            And behold a ladder was planted firmly on the ground, the <lb/>
            head of which reached to heaven, and the angels of God were <lb/>
            ascending and descending along it."‡ By the ladder in this <lb/>
            thing, which is called the world, is figuratively understood the <lb/>
            air, the foundation of which is the earth, and the head is the <lb/>
            heaven ; for the large interior space, which being extended in <lb/>
            every direction, reaches from the orb of the moon, which is <note type="footnote"> * The marginal note in our bible translates Israel, " a prince of <lb/>
            God." </note><note type="footnote"> t Genesis xxxii. 25; where, however, the expression of the bible is <lb/>
            "the hollow of Jacob's thigh was out of joint." </note><note type="footnote"> ‡ Genesis xxviii. 12. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="321"/>
            described as the most remote of the order in heaven, but the <lb/>
            nearest to us by those who contemplate sublime objects, down <lb/>
            to the earth, which is the lowest of such bodies, is the air. <lb/>
            This air is the abode of incorporeal souls, since it seemed good <lb/>
            to the Creator of the universe to fill all the parts of the world <lb/>
            with living creatures. On this account he prepared the ter­ <lb/>
            restrial animals for the earth, the aquatic animals for the sea <lb/>
            and for the rivers, and the stars for the heaven; for every one <lb/>
            of these bodies is not merely a living animal, but is also pro­ <lb/>
            perly described as the very purest and most universal mind <lb/>
            extending through the universe; so that there are living crea­ <lb/>
            ures in that other section of the universe, the air.</p>
          <p>And if these things are not comprehensible by the outward <lb/>
            senses, what of that ? For the soul also is invisible. And yet <lb/>
            it is probable that the air should nourish living animals even <lb/>
            more than the land or the water. Why so ? Because it is the <lb/>
            air which has given vitality to those animals which live on the <lb/>
            earth and in the water. For the Creator of the universe <lb/>
            formed the air so that it should be the habit of those bodies <lb/>
            which are immoveable, and the nature of those which are moved <lb/>
            in an invisible manner, and the soul of such as are able to <lb/>
            exert an impetus and visible sense of their own. Is it hot <lb/>
            then absurd that that element, by means of which the other <lb/>
            elements have been filled with vitality, should itself be destitute <lb/>
            of living things? Therefore let no one deprive the most <lb/>
            excellent nature of living creatures of the most excellent of <lb/>
            those elements which surround the earth ; that is to say, of the <lb/>
            air. For not only is it not alone deserted by all things besides, <lb/>
            but rather, like a populous city, it is full of imperishable and <lb/>
            immortal citizens, souls equal in number to the stars.</p>
          <p>Now of these souls some descend upon the earth with a view <lb/>
            to being bound up in mortal bodies, those namely which are <lb/>
            most nearly connected with the earth, and which are lovers of <lb/>
            the body. But some soar upwards, being again distinguished <lb/>
            according to the definitions and times which have been <lb/>
            appointed by nature. Of these, those which are influenced by <lb/>
            a desire for mortal life, and which have been familiarised to it, <lb/>
            again return to it. But others, condemning the body of great <lb/>
            folly and trifling, have pronounced it a prison and a grave, <lb/>
            and, flying from it as from a house of correction or a tomb. <note type="footnote"> VOL. IL </note> <note type="footnote"> y </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="322"/>
            have raised themselves aloft on light wings towards the æther, <lb/>
            and have devoted their whole lives to sublime speculations.</p>
          <p>There are others, again, the purest and most excellent of all, <lb/>
            which have received greater and more divine intellects, never <lb/>
            by any chance desiring any earthly thing whatever, but being <lb/>
            as it were lieutenants of the Ruler of the universe, as though <lb/>
            they were the eyes and ears of the great king, beholding and <lb/>
            listening to everything. Now philosophers in general are <lb/>
            wont to call these demons, but the sacred scripture calls them <lb/>
            angels, using a name more in accordance with nature. For <lb/>
            indeed they do report (<foreign xml:lang="grc">διαγγέλλουσι</foreign>) the injunctions of the <lb/>
            father to his children, and the necessities of the children to the <lb/>
            father.</p>
          <p>And it is in reference to this employment of theirs that the <lb/>
            holy scripture has represented them as ascending and <lb/>
            descending, not because God, who knows everything before <lb/>
            any other being, has any need of interpreters ; but because it <lb/>
            is the lot of us miserable mortals to use speech as a mediator <lb/>
            and intercessor; because of our standing in awe of and fearing <lb/>
            the Ruler of the universe, and the all-powerful might of his <lb/>
            authority; having received a notion of which he once <lb/>
            entreated one of those mediators, saying : " Do thou speak for <lb/>
            ns, and let not God speak to us, lest we die."* For not only <lb/>
            are we unable to endure his chastisements, but we cannot bear <lb/>
            even his excessive and unmodified benefits, which he himself <lb/>
            proffers us of his own accord, without employing the ministra­ <lb/>
            tions of any other beings.</p>
          <p>Very admirably therefore does Moses represent the air under <lb/>
            the figurative symbol of a ladder, as planted solidly in the <lb/>
            earth and reaching up to heaven. For it comes to pass that <lb/>
            the evaporations which are given forth by the earth becoming <lb/>
            rarefied, are dissolved into air, so that the earth is the founda­ <lb/>
            tion and root of the air, and that the heaven is its head. <lb/>
            Accordingly it is said that the moon is not an unadulterated <lb/>
            consolidation of pure aether, as each of the other stars is, but <lb/>
            is rather a combination of the aether-like and air-like essence. <lb/>
            For that black spot which appears in it, which some call a <lb/>
            face, is nothing else but the air mingled with it, which is by <lb/>
            nature black, and which extends as far as heaven.</p>
          <p>XXIII. The ladder therefore in the world which is here <note type="footnote"> * Exodus xx 19. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="323"/>
            spoken of in this symbolical manner, was something of this <lb/>
            sort. But if we carefully investigate the soul which exists in <lb/>
            men, the foundation of which is something corporeal, and as it <lb/>
            were earth-like, we shall find that foundation to be the outward <lb/>
            sense; and the head to be something heavenly, as it were the <lb/>
            most pure mind. But all the words of God move incessantly <lb/>
            upwards and downwards through the whole of it, dragging it <lb/>
            upwards along with them whenever they soar aloft, and sepa­ <lb/>
            rating it from whatever is mortal, and exhibiting to it a sight <lb/>
            of those things which alone are worthy of being beheld; but <lb/>
            yet not casting it down when they descend. For neither is <lb/>
            God himself, nor the word of God, worthy of blame. But they <lb/>
            ioin with them in their descent, by reason of their love for <lb/>
            mankind and compassion for our race, for the sake of being their <lb/>
            allies and rendering them assistance, in order that by breathing <lb/>
            in a saving inspiration they may recall to life the soul which <lb/>
            was still being tossed about in the body as in the river.</p>
          <p>Now the God and governor of the universe does by him­ <lb/>
            self and alone walk about invisibly and noiselessly in the <lb/>
            minds of those who are purified in the highest degree. For <lb/>
            there is extant a prophecy which was delivered to the wise man, <lb/>
            in which it is said: "I will walk among you, and I will be <lb/>
            your God."* But the angels-the words of God—move about <lb/>
            in the minds of those persons who are still in a process of being <lb/>
            washed, but who have not yet completely washed off the life <lb/>
            which defiles them, and which is polluted by the contact of <lb/>
            their heavy bodies, making them look pure and brilliant to the <lb/>
            eyes of virtue.</p>
          <p>But it is plain enough what vast numbers of evils are driven <lb/>
            out, and what a multitude of wicked inhabitants is expelled in <lb/>
            order that one good man may be introduced to dwell there. Do <lb/>
            thou, therefore, 0 my soul, hasten to become the abode of God, <lb/>
            his holy temple, to become strong from having been most weak, <lb/>
            powerful from having been powerless, wise from having been fool­ <lb/>
            ish, and very reasonable from having been doting and childless.</p>
          <p>And perhaps too the practiser of virtue represents his own <lb/>
            life as like to a ladder; for the practice of anything is natu­ <lb/>
            rally an anomalous thing, since at one time it soars up to a <lb/>
            height, and at another it turns downwards in a contrary direc­ <lb/>
            tion ; and at one time has a fair voyage like a ship, and at <note type="footnote"> * Leviticus xxvi. 12. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="324"/>
            another has but an unfavourable passage ; for, as some one says, <lb/>
            the life of those who practise virtue is full of vicissitudes; <lb/>
            being at one time alive and waking, and at another dead or <lb/>
            sleeping. And perhaps this is no incorrect statement; for the <lb/>
            wise have obtained the heavenly and celestial country as their <lb/>
            habitation ; having learnt to be continually mounting upwards, <lb/>
            but the wicked have received as their share the dark recesses <lb/>
            of hell, having from the beginning to the end of their existence <lb/>
            practised dying, and having been from their infancy to their <lb/>
            old age familiarised with destruction.</p>
          <p>But the practisers of virtue, for they are on the boundary <lb/>
            between two extremities, are frequently going upwards and <lb/>
            downwards as if on a ladder, being either drawn upwards by a <lb/>
            more powerful fate, or else being dragged down by that which <lb/>
            is worse; until the umpire of this contention and conflict, <lb/>
            namely God, adjudges the victory to the more excellent class <lb/>
            and utterly destroys the other.</p>
          <p>XXIV. There is also in this dream another sort of simili­ <lb/>
            tude or comparison apparent, which must not be passed over <lb/>
            in silence; the affairs of mankind are naturally compared to a <lb/>
            ladder, on account of their irregular motion and progress : for <lb/>
            as some one or other has said; " One day has cast one man <lb/>
            down from on high and destroyed him, and another it has <lb/>
            raised up, nothing that belongs to our human race being <lb/>
            formed by nature so as to remain long in the same condition, <lb/>
            but all such things changing with all kinds of alteration. Do <lb/>
            not men become rulers from having been private individuals, <lb/>
            and private individuals from having been rulers, poor from <lb/>
            having been rich, and very rich from having been poor; <lb/>
            glorious from been despised, and most illustrious from having <lb/>
            been infamous ?" * * * * <lb/>
            A very beautiful way of life : for it is very possible that the <lb/>
            being whose habitation is the whole world, may dwell with <lb/>
            you also, and take care of your house, so that it may be com­ <lb/>
            pletely protected and free from injury for ever; and there is <lb/>
            such a way as this in which human affairs move upwards and <lb/>
            downwards, meeting with an unstable and variable fortune, <lb/>
            the anomalous character of which, unerring time proves by <lb/>
            evidence which is not indistinct but manifest and legible.</p>
          <p>XXV. But the dream also represented the archangel, <lb/>
            namely the Lord himself, firmly planted on the ladder; for wo <lb/>
             <pb n="325"/>
            must imagine that the living God stands above all things, like <lb/>
            the charioteer of a chariot, or the pilot of a ship; that is, above <lb/>
            bodies, and above souls, and above all creatures, and above the <lb/>
            earth, and above the air, and above the heaven, and above all <lb/>
            the powers of the outward senses, and above the invisible <lb/>
            natures, in short, above all things whether visible or invisible ; <lb/>
            for having made the whole to depend upon himself, he governs <lb/>
            it and all the vastness of nature.</p>
          <p>But let no one who hears that he was firmly planted thus <lb/>
            suppose that any thing at all assists God, so as to enable him <lb/>
            to stand firmly, but let him rather consider this fact that what <lb/>
            is here indicated is equivalent to the assertion that the firmest <lb/>
            position, and the bulwark, and the strength, and the steadiness <lb/>
            of everything is the immoveable God, who stamps the charac­ <lb/>
            ter of immobility on whatever he pleases ; for, in consequence <lb/>
            of his supporting and consolidating things, those which he does <lb/>
            combine remain firm and indestructible.</p>
          <p>Therefore he who stands upon the ladder of heaven says to <lb/>
            him who is beholding the dream, " I am the Lord God of <lb/>
            Abraham thy father, and the God of Isaac : be not afraid."* <lb/>
            This oracle and this vision were also the firmest support of the <lb/>
            soul devoted to the practice of virtue, inasmuch as it taught it <lb/>
            that the Lord and God of the universe is both these things <lb/>
            also to his own race, being entitled both the Lord and <lb/>
            God of all men, and of his grandfathers and ancestors, and <lb/>
            being called by both names in order that the whole world and <lb/>
            the man devoted to virtue might have the same inheritance ; <lb/>
            since it is also said, " The Lord himself is his inheritance."†</p>
          <p>XXVI. But do not fancy that it is an accidental thing here <lb/>
            for him to be called in this place the God and Lord of <lb/>
            Abraham, but only the God of Isaac; for this latter is the <lb/>
            symbol of the knowledge which exists by nature, which hears <lb/>
            itself, and teaches itself, and learns of itself; but Abraham is <lb/>
            the symbol of that which is derived from the teaching of <lb/>
            others ; and the one again is an indigenous and native inhabit­ <lb/>
            ant of his country, but the other is only a settler and a <lb/>
            foreigner; for having forsaken the language of those who <lb/>
            indulge in sublime conversations about astronomy, a language <lb/>
            imitating that of the Chaldæans, foreign and barbarous, he was <note type="footnote"> * Genesis XXVIII. 13. </note> <note type="footnote"> f Deuteronomy x. 9. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="326"/>
            brought over to that which was suited to a rational being, <lb/>
            namely, to the service of the great Cause of all things.</p>
          <p>Now this disposition stands in need of two powers to take <lb/>
            care of it, the power that is of authority, and that of conferring <lb/>
            benefits, in order that in accordance with the authority of the <lb/>
            governor, it may obey the admonitions which it receives, and <lb/>
            also that it may be greatly benefited by his beneficence. But <lb/>
            the other disposition stands in need of the power of beneficence <lb/>
            only ; for it has not derived any improvement from the autho­ <lb/>
            rity which admonishes it, inasmuch as it naturally claims <lb/>
            virtue as its own, but by reason of the bounty which is <lb/>
            showered upon it from above, it was good and perfect from the <lb/>
            beginning; therefore God is the name of the beneficent power, <lb/>
            and Lord is the title of the royal power.</p>
          <p>What then can any one call a more ancient and important <lb/>
            good, than to be thought worthy to meet with unmixed and <lb/>
            unalloyed beneficence ? And what can be less valuable than <lb/>
            to receive a mixture of authority and liberality? And it <lb/>
            appears to me that it was because the practiser of virtue saw <lb/>
            that he uttered that most admirable prayer that, " the Lord <lb/>
            might be to him as God ; "* for he desired no longer to stand <lb/>
            in awe of him as a governor, but to honour and love hill as a <lb/>
            benefactor. Now is it not fitting that even blind men should <lb/>
            become sharp-sighted in their minds to these and similar things, <lb/>
            being endowed with the power of sight by the most sacred <lb/>
            oracles, so as to be able to contemplate the glories of nature, <lb/>
            and not to be limited to the mere uuderstanding of the <lb/>
            words ? But even if we voluutarily close the eye of our soul and <lb/>
            take no care to understand such mysteries, or if we are unable <lb/>
            to look up to them, the hierophant himself stands by and <lb/>
            prompts us. And do not thou ever cease through weariness to <lb/>
            anoint thy eves until you have introduced those who are duly <lb/>
            initiated to the secret light of the sacred scriptures, and have <lb/>
            displayed to them the hidden thiugs therein contaiued, and <lb/>
            their reality, which is invisible to those who are uninitiated.</p>
          <p>It is becoming then for you to act thus; but as for ye, 0 <lb/>
            souls, who have once tasted of diviue love, as if you had even <lb/>
            awakened from deep sleep, dissipate the mist that is before <lb/>
            you; and hasten forward to that beautiful spectacle, putting <lb/>
            aside slow and hesitating fear, in order to comprehend all the <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xxviii. 21 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="327"/>
            beautiful sounds and sights which the president of the games <lb/>
            has prepared for your advantage.</p>
          <p>XXVII. There are then a countless number of things well <lb/>
            worthy of being displayed and demonstrated ; and among them <lb/>
            one which was mentioned a little while ago ; for the oracle <lb/>
            calls the person who was really his grandfather, the father of <lb/>
            the practiser of virtue, and to him who was really his father, <lb/>
            it has not given any such title ; for the scripture says, "I am <lb/>
            the Lord God of Abraham thy father," but in reality Abraham <lb/>
            was his grandfather; and then proceeds, ,. And the God of <lb/>
            Isaac," and in this case he does not add, " thy father :" is it <lb/>
            not then worth while to examine into the cause of this differ­ <lb/>
            ence? Undoubtedly it is; let us then in a careful manner <lb/>
            apply ourselves to the consideration of the cause.</p>
          <p>Philosophers say that virtue exists among men, either by <lb/>
            nature, or by practice, or by learning. On which account the <lb/>
            sacred scriptures represent the three founders of the nation of <lb/>
            the Israelites as wise men ; not indeed originally endowed with <lb/>
            the same kind of wisdom, but arriving rapidly at the same end. <lb/>
            For the eldest of them, Abraham, had instruction for his <lb/>
            guide in the road which conducted him to virtue; as we shall <lb/>
            show in another treatise to the best of our power. And Isaac, <lb/>
            who is the middle one of the three, had a self-taught and self- <lb/>
            instructed nature. And Jacob, the third, arrived at this point <lb/>
            by industry and practice, in accordance with which were his <lb/>
            labours of wrestling and contention.</p>
          <p>Since then there are thus three different manners by which <lb/>
            wisdom exists among men, it happens that the two extremes <lb/>
            are the most nearly and frequently united. For the virtue <lb/>
            which is acquired by practice, is the offspring of that which is <lb/>
            derived from learning. But that which is implanted by nature <lb/>
            is indeed akin to the others, for it is set below them, as the <lb/>
            root for them all. But it has obtained its prize without any <lb/>
            rivalry or difficulty. So that it is thus very natural for <lb/>
            Abraham, as one who had been improved by instruction, to be <lb/>
            called the father of Jacob, who arrived at his height of virtue by <lb/>
            practice. By which expression is indicated not so much the <lb/>
            relationship of one man to the other, but that the power which <lb/>
            is fond of hearing is very ready for learning ; the power which <lb/>
            is devoted to practice being also well suited for wrestling. If, <note type="footnote"> it Genesis xxviii. 13. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="328"/>
            however, this practiser of virtue runs on vigorously towards the <lb/>
            end and learns to see clearly what he previously only dreamed <lb/>
            of in an indistinct way, being altered and re-stamped with a <lb/>
            better character, and being called Israel, that is, the man who <lb/>
            sees God," instead of Jacob, that is, " the supplanter," he then <lb/>
            is no longer set down as the son of Abraham, as his father, of <lb/>
            him who derived wisdom from instruction, but as the son of <lb/>
            Israel, who was born excellent by mature.</p>
          <p>These statements are not fables of my own invention, but are <lb/>
            the oracle written on the sacred pillars. For, says the <lb/>
            scripture: " Israel having departed, he and all that he had <lb/>
            came to the well of the oath, and there he sacrificed a sacrifice <lb/>
            to the God of his father Isaac."* Do yon not now perceive <lb/>
            that this present assertion has reference not to the relationship <lb/>
            between mortal men, but, as was said before, to the nature of <lb/>
            things? For look at what is before us. At one time, Jacob <lb/>
            is spoken of as the son of his father Abraham, and at another <lb/>
            time he is called Israel, the son of Isaac, on account of the <lb/>
            reason which we have thus accurately investigated.</p>
          <p>XXVIII. Having then said: " I am the Lord God of <lb/>
            Abraham, the father and the God of Isaac," he adds : " Be not <lb/>
            afraid," very consistently. For how can we any longer be <lb/>
            ufraid when we have thee, 0 God, as our armour and defender ? <lb/>
            Thee, the deliverer from fear and from every painful feeling? <lb/>
            Thee, who hast also fashioned the archetypal forms of our <lb/>
            instruction while they were still indistinct, so as to make them <lb/>
            visible, teaching Abraham wisdom, and begetting Isaac, who <lb/>
            was wise from his birth. For you condescended to be called <lb/>
            the guide of the one and the father of the other, assigning to <lb/>
            the one the rank of a pupil, and to the other that of a son.</p>
          <p>For this reason, too, God promised that he would give him <lb/>
            the land. I mean by the land here, all-prolific virtue, on which <lb/>
            the practiser rests from his contests and sleeps, from the fact <lb/>
            of the life according to the outward sense being lulled asleep, <lb/>
            and that of the soul being awakened. Receiving gladly peace­ <lb/>
            ful repose there, which he did not obtain without war, and the <lb/>
            afflictions which arise from war, not by means of bearing arms <lb/>
            and slaying men; away with any such notion ! but by over­ <lb/>
            throwing the array of vices and passions which are the <lb/>
            adversaries of virtue. <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xlvi. 1. </note> <pb n="329"/>
            </p>
          <p>But the race of wisdom is likened to the sand of the sea, <lb/>
            by reason of its boundless numbers, and because also the sand, <lb/>
            like a fringe, checks the incursions of the sea ; as the reasonings <lb/>
            of instruction beat back the violence of wickedness and iniquity. <lb/>
            And these reasonings, in accordance with the divine promises, <lb/>
            are extended to the very extremities of the universe. And <lb/>
            they show that he who is possessed of them is the inheritor of <lb/>
            all the parts of the world, penetrating everywhere, to the east, <lb/>
            and to the west, to the south, and to the north. For it is said <lb/>
            in the scripture : " He shall be extended towards the sea, and <lb/>
            towards the south, and towards the north, and towards the <lb/>
            east."* But the wise and virtuous man is not only a blessing <lb/>
            to himself, but he is also a common good to all men, diffusing <lb/>
            advantages over all from his own ready store. For as the sun <lb/>
            is the light of all those beings who have eyes, so also is the <lb/>
            wise man light to all those who partake of a rational nature.</p>
          <p>XXIX. " For in thee shall all the nations of the earth be <lb/>
            blessed." And this oracle applies to the wise man in respect <lb/>
            of himself, and also in respect of others.! For if the mind <lb/>
            which is in me is purified by perfect virtue, and if the tribes of <lb/>
            that earthly part which is about me are purified at the same <lb/>
            time, which tribes have fallen to the lot of the external senses, <lb/>
            and of the greatest channel of all, namely the body; and if <lb/>
            any one, either in his house, or in his city, or in his country, or <lb/>
            in his nation, becomes a lover of wisdom, it is inevitable that <lb/>
            that house, and that city, and that country, and that nation, <lb/>
            must attain to a better life. For, as those spices which are set <lb/>
            on fire fill all persons near them with their fragrance, so in the <lb/>
            same manner do all those persons who are neighbours of and <lb/>
            contiguous to the wise man catch some of the exhalations <lb/>
            which reach to a distance from him, and so become improved in <lb/>
            their characters.</p>
          <p>XXX. And it is the greatest of all advantages to a soul <lb/>
            engaged in labours and contests, to have for its fellow traveller, <lb/>
            God, who penetrates everywhere. " For behold," says God, <lb/>
            " I am with thee."‡ Of what then can we be in need while <lb/>
            we have for our wealth Thee, who art the only true and real <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xxviii. 14. </note><note type="footnote"> t The text is very corrupt here. I have followed Mangey's reading <lb/>
            and translation. </note><note type="footnote"> ‡ Genesis xxviii. 15. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="330"/>
            riches, who keepest us in the road which leads to virtue in all <lb/>
            its different divisions ? For it is not one portion only of the <lb/>
            rational life which conducts to justice and to all other virtue, <lb/>
            but the parts are infinite iu number, from which those who <lb/>
            desire to arrive at virtue can set out.</p>
          <p>XXXI. Very admirably therefore is it said in the scripture: <lb/>
            " I will lead thee back to this land." For it was fitting that <lb/>
            the reason should remain with itself, and should not depart <lb/>
            to the outward sense. And if it has departed, then the next <lb/>
            best thing is for it to return back again. And perhaps also a <lb/>
            doctrine bearing on the immortality of the soul is figuratively <lb/>
            intimated by this expression. For the soul, having left the <lb/>
            region of heaven, as was mentioned a little while before, came <lb/>
            to the body as to a foreign country. Therefore the father who <lb/>
            begot it promises that he will not permit it to be for ever held <lb/>
            in bondage, but that he will have compassion on it, and will <lb/>
            unloose its chains, and will conduct it in safety and freedom as <lb/>
            far as the metropolis, and will not cease to assist it till the <lb/>
            promises which he has made in words are confirmed by the <lb/>
            truth of actions. For it is by all means the peculiar attribute <lb/>
            of God to foretell what is to happen.</p>
          <p>And why do we say this ? for his words do not differ from <lb/>
            his actions; therefore the soul which is devoted to the practice <lb/>
            of virtue, being set in motion, and roused up to the investiga­ <lb/>
            tions relating to the living God, at first suspected that the <lb/>
            living God existed in place ; but after a short space it became <lb/>
            perplexed by the difficulty of the question, and began to <lb/>
            change itso pinion. " For," says the scripture, " Jacob awoke <lb/>
            and said, Surely the Lord is in this place, and I knew it not;" <lb/>
            and it would have been better, I should have said; not to know <lb/>
            it, than to fancy that God existed in any place, he who him­ <lb/>
            self contains all things in a circle.</p>
          <p>XXXII. Very naturally, therefore, was Jacob afraid, and <lb/>
            said in a spirit of admiration, " how dreadful is this place."* <lb/>
            For, in truth, of all the topics or places in natural philosophy, <lb/>
            the most formidable is that in which it is inquired where the <lb/>
            living God is, and whether in short he is in any place at all. <lb/>
            Since some persons affirm that everything which exists <lb/>
            occupies some place or other, and others assign each thing a <lb/>
            different place, either in the world or out of the world, in <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xxviii. 16. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="331"/>
            some space between the different bodies of the universe. <lb/>
            Others again affirm that the uncreated God resembles no <lb/>
            created being whatever, but that he is superior to everything, <lb/>
            so that the very swiftest conception is outstripped by him, <lb/>
            and confesses that it is very far inferior to the comprehension <lb/>
            of him; wherefore it speedily cries out, This is not what I <lb/>
            expected, because the Lord is in the place ; for he surrounds <lb/>
            everything, but in truth and reason he is not surrounded by <lb/>
            anything.</p>
          <p>And this thing which is demonstrated and visible, this <lb/>
            world perceptible by the outward senses, is nothing else but <lb/>
            the house of God, the abode of one of the powers of the true <lb/>
            God, in accordance with which he is good; and he calls this <lb/>
            world an abode, and he has also pronounced it with great <lb/>
            truth to be the gate of heaven. Now, what does this mean ? <lb/>
            We cannot comprehend the world which consists of various <lb/>
            species, in that which is fashioned in accordance with the <lb/>
            divine regulations, appreciable only by the intellect, in any <lb/>
            other manner than by making a migration upwards from this <lb/>
            other world perceptible by the outward senses and visible ; for <lb/>
            it is not possible either to perceive any other existing being <lb/>
            which is incorporeal, without deriving our principles of judg­ <lb/>
            ment from bodies. For while they are quiet, their place is <lb/>
            perceived, and when they are in motion we judge of their <lb/>
            time; but the points, and the lines, and the superficies, and in <lb/>
            short the boundaries ......* as of a garment wrapped <lb/>
            externally around it.</p>
          <p>According to analogy, therefore, the knowledge of the <lb/>
            world appreciable by the intellect is attained to by means of <lb/>
            our knowledge of that which is perceptible by the outward <lb/>
            senses, which is as it were a gate to the other. For as men <lb/>
            who wish to see cities enter in through the gates, so also they <lb/>
            who wish to comprehend the invisible world are conducted in <lb/>
            their search by the appearance of the visible one. And the <lb/>
            world of that essence which is only open to the intellect with­ <lb/>
            out any visible appearance or figure whatever, and which exists <lb/>
            only in the archetypal idea which exists in the mind, which is <lb/>
            fashioned according to its appearance, will be brought on with­ <note type="footnote"> * There is an hiatus here, which cannot be filled up satisfactorily. <lb/>
            The whole of the rest of the chapter is pronounced by Mangey to be <lb/>
            obscure and corrupt, and almost unintelligible. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="332"/>
            out any shade ; all the walls, and all the gates which could <lb/>
            impede its progress being removed, so that it is not looked at <lb/>
            through any other medium, but by itself, putting forth a <lb/>
            beauty which is susceptible of no change, presenting an <lb/>
            indescribable and exquisite spectacle.</p>
          <p>XXXIII. But enough of this. There is another dream also <lb/>
            which belongs to the same class, that one I mean about the <lb/>
            spotted flock, which the person who beheld it relates after he <lb/>
            had awoke, saying, " The angel of God spake unto me in <lb/>
            a dream, and said, Jacob; and I said, What is it ? And he <lb/>
            said unto me, Look up with thine eyes, and see the goats and <lb/>
            the rams mounting on the flocks, and the she-goats, some <lb/>
            white, and spotted, and ring-straked, and speckled : for I have <lb/>
            beheld all that Laban does unto thee. I am that God who <lb/>
            was seen by thee in the place of God, where thou anointedst <lb/>
            the pillar, and vowedst a vow unto me. Now therefore, rise up <lb/>
            and depart out of this land, and go into the land of thy birth, <lb/>
            and I will be with thee."*</p>
          <p>You see here, that the divine word speaks of dreams as sent <lb/>
            from God; including in this statement not those only which <lb/>
            appear through the agency of the chief cause itself, but those <lb/>
            also which are seen through the operation of his interpreters <lb/>
            and attendant angels, who are thought by the father who <lb/>
            created them to be worthy of a divine and blessed lot: consider, <lb/>
            however, what comes afterwards. The sacred word enjoins <lb/>
            some persons what they ought to do by positive command, like <lb/>
            a king ; to others it suggests what will be for their advantage, <lb/>
            as a preceptor does to his pupils; to others again, it is like a <lb/>
            counsellor suggesting the wisest plans ; and in this way too, it <lb/>
            is of great advantage to those who do not of themselves know <lb/>
            what is expedient; to others it is like a friend, in a mild and <lb/>
            persuasive manner, bringing forward many secret things which <lb/>
            no uninitiated person may lawfully hear.</p>
          <p>For at times it asks some persons, as for instance, Adam, <lb/>
            " Where art thou ? " And any one may properly answer to such <lb/>
            a question, " No where?" Because all human affairs never <lb/>
            remain long in the same condition, but are moved about and <lb/>
            changed, whether we speak of their soul or their body, or of <lb/>
            their external circumstances ; for their minds are unstable, not <lb/>
            always having the same impressions from the same things, but <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xxxi. 11. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="333"/>
            such as are diametrically contrary to their former ones. The <lb/>
            body also is unstable, as all the changes of the different ages <lb/>
            from infancy to old age show; their external circumstances also <lb/>
            are variable, being tossed up and down by the impetus of ever­ <lb/>
            agitated fortune.</p>
          <p>XXXIV. When, however, he comes into an assembly of <lb/>
            friends, he does not begin to speak before he has first accosted <lb/>
            each individual among them, and addressed him by name, so <lb/>
            that they prick up their ears, and are quiet and attentive, <lb/>
            listening to the oracles thus delivered, so as never to forget <lb/>
            them or let them escape their memory: since in another pass­ <lb/>
            age of scripture we read, "Be silent and listen."* In this <lb/>
            manner too, Moses is called up to the bush. For, the <lb/>
            scripture says, " When he saw that he was turning aside to see, <lb/>
            God called him out of the bush, and said, Moses, Moses: and <lb/>
            he said, What is it, Lord ?"t</p>
          <p>And Abraham also, on the occasion of offering up his. <lb/>
            beloved and only son as a burnt-offering, when he was <lb/>
            beginning to sacrifice him, and when he had given proof of <lb/>
            his piety, was forbidden to destroy the self-taught race, Isaac <lb/>
            by name, from among men; for at the beginning of his <lb/>
            account of this transaction, Moses says that " God did tempt <lb/>
            Abraham, and said unto him, Abraham, Abraham; and he <lb/>
            said, Behold, here am I. And he said unto him, Take now thy <lb/>
            beloved son Isaac, whom thou lovest, and offer him up." <lb/>
            And when he had brought the victim to the altar, then the <lb/>
            angel of the Lord called him out of heaven, saying, "Abraham, <lb/>
            Abraham," and he answered, " Behold, here am I. And he said, <lb/>
            Lay not thy hand upon the child, and do nothing to him:" ‡</p>
          <p>Also the practiser of virtue is also called one of this company <lb/>
            dear to God, being deservedly accounted worthy of the same <lb/>
            honour; for, says the scripture, "The angel of God said to <lb/>
            me in my sleep, Jacob: and I answered, and said, What <lb/>
            is it ?" § But after he has been called he exerts his attention, <lb/>
            endeavouring to arrive at an accurate knowledge of the symbols <lb/>
            which are displayed to him; and these symbols are the con­ <lb/>
            nection and generation of reasonings, as flocks and herds. <lb/>
            For, says the scripture, " Jacob, looking up with his eyes, <lb/>
            saw the goats and the rams leaping upon the she-goats and <note type="footnote"> * Deuteronomy xxvii. 9. </note><note type="footnote"> ‡Genesis xxii. 1. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Exodus iii. 4. </note><note type="footnote"> § Genesis xxxi. 10. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="334"/>
            upon the sheep." Now the he-goat is the leader of the flock of <lb/>
            goats, and the ram is the leader of the flock of sheep, and <lb/>
            these two animals are symbols of perfect reasonings, one <lb/>
            of which purifies and cleanses the soul of sins, and the other <lb/>
            nourishes it and renders it full of good actions.</p>
          <p>Such then are the leaders of the flocks in us, namely, <lb/>
            reasons; and the flocks themselves, resembling the sheep and <lb/>
            goats whose names they bear, rush forwards and hasten with <lb/>
            zeal and earnestness towards justice.</p>
          <p>Therefore, looking up with the eye of his mind, which up <lb/>
            to that time had been closed, he saw the perfect and thoroughly <lb/>
            sharpened reasons analogically resembling the goats and rams, <lb/>
            prepared for the diminution of offences and the increase of <lb/>
            good actions. And he beheld how they leap upon the sheep and <lb/>
            the goats, that is on those souls which are still young and <lb/>
            tender, and in the vigour of youth, and beautiful in the flower <lb/>
            of their age ; not pursuing irrational pleasure, but indulging <lb/>
            in the invisible sowing of the doctrines of prudence. For this <lb/>
            is a marriage which is blessed in its children; not uniting <lb/>
            bodies, but adapting perfect virtues to well-disposed souls.</p>
          <p>Therefore do all ye right reasons of wisdom leap up, form <lb/>
            connections, sow seed, and pass by no soul which you see rich <lb/>
            and fertile, and well-disposed, and virgin; but inviting it to <lb/>
            association and connection with you, render it perfect and <lb/>
            pregnant; for so you will become the parents of all kinds of <lb/>
            good things, of a male offspring, white, variegated, ring-straked, <lb/>
            and speckled.</p>
          <p>XXXV. But we must now examine what power each of these <lb/>
            offspring has. Now those which are purely white (<foreign xml:lang="grc">διάλευϰοι</foreign>) <lb/>
            are the most beautiful and the most conspicuous ; the word <foreign xml:lang="grc">διὰ</foreign> <lb/>
            being often prefixed in composition by way of adding force to <lb/>
            the word, so that the words <unclear>διάδηλο</unclear> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">διάσημον</foreign> are commonly <lb/>
            used to signify what is very conspicuous (<foreign xml:lang="grc">δη̃λον</foreign>) and very <lb/>
            remarkable ;therefore them caning here is that the <lb/>
            first-born offspring of the soul which has received the sacred <lb/>
            seed, is purely white; being like light in which there is no <lb/>
            obscurity, and like the most brilliant radiance: like the <lb/>
            unclouded beam which might proceed from the rays of the sun <lb/>
            in fine weather at mid-day. Again, by the statement that some <lb/>
            are variegated, what is meant is, not that the flocks are marked <lb/>
            by such a multiform and various spottedness as to resemble the <lb/>
             <pb n="335"/>
            unclean leprosy, and which is an emblem of a life unsteady and <lb/>
            tossed about in any direction by reason of the fickleness of the <lb/>
            mind, but only that they have marks drawn in regular lines and <lb/>
            different characters, shaped and impressed with all kinds of <lb/>
            well approved forms, the peculiarities of which, being mingled <lb/>
            together and combined properly, will produce a musical har­ <lb/>
            mony.</p>
          <p>For some persons have looked upon the art of variegating <lb/>
            as so random and obscure a matter, that they have referred it <lb/>
            to weavers. But I admire not only the art itself, but the <lb/>
            name likewise, and most especially so when I look upon the <lb/>
            divisions of the earth and the spheres in heaven, and the dif­ <lb/>
            ferences between various plants and various animals, and that <lb/>
            most variegated texture, I mean the world; for I am com­ <lb/>
            pelled to suppose, that the maker of this universal textile <lb/>
            fabric was also the inventor of all varied and variegating <lb/>
            science; and I look with reverence upon the inventor, and I <lb/>
            honour the art which he invented, and 1 am amazed at the <lb/>
            work which is the result, and this too, though it is but a very <lb/>
            small portion of it which I have been able to see, but still, <lb/>
            from the portion which has been unfolded to me, if indeed I <lb/>
            may say that it has been unfolded, I hope to form a tolerably <lb/>
            accurate judgment of the whole, guiding my conjectures by the <lb/>
            light of analogy.</p>
          <p>Nevertheless I admire the lover of wisdom for having stu­ <lb/>
            died the same art, collecting and thinking fit to weave together <lb/>
            many things, though different, and proceeding from different <lb/>
            sources, into the same web ; for taking the two first elements <lb/>
            from the grammatical knowledge imparted to children, that is <lb/>
            to say, reading and writing, and taking from the more perfect <lb/>
            growth of knowledge the skill which is found among poets, and <lb/>
            the comprehension of ancient history, and deriving certainty <lb/>
            and freedom from deception from arithmetic and geometry, in <lb/>
            which sciences there is need of proportions and calculations; <lb/>
            and borrowing from music rhyme, and metre, and harmonies, <lb/>
            and chromatics, and diatonics, and combined and disjoined me­ <lb/>
            lodies; and having derived from rhetoric invention, and lan­ <lb/>
            guage, and arrangement, and memory, and action; and from <lb/>
            philosophy, whatever has been omitted in any of these sepa­ <lb/>
            rate branches, and all the other things of which human life <lb/>
            consists, he has put together in one most admirably arranged <lb/>
             <pb n="336"/>
            work, combining great learning of one kind witn great learn­ <lb/>
            ing of another kind.</p>
          <p>Now the sacred scripture calls the maker of this compound <lb/>
            work Besaleel, which name, being interpreted, signifies "in <lb/>
            the shadow of God ;" for he makes all the copies, and the <lb/>
            man by name Moses makes all the models, as the principal <lb/>
            architect; and for this reason it is, that the one only draws <lb/>
            outlines as it were, but the other is not content with such <lb/>
            sketches, but makes the archetypal natures themselves, and <lb/>
            has already adorned the holy places with his variegating art; <lb/>
            but the wise man is called the only adorner of the place ot <lb/>
            wisdom in the oracles delivered in the sacred scriptures.</p>
          <p>XXXVI. And the most beautiful and varied work of God, <lb/>
            this world, has been created in this its present state of per­ <lb/>
            fection by all-wise knowledge; and how can it be anything <lb/>
            but right to receive the art of variegating as a noble effort of <lb/>
            knowledge ? the most sacred copy of which is the whole word <lb/>
            of wisdom, which will bear about in its bosom the things of <lb/>
            heaven and of earth, from which the practiser of virtue <lb/>
            elaborates his notions of various things.</p>
          <p>For after the white sheep he immediately beheld the varie­ <lb/>
            gated animals, stamped with the impression of instruction. <lb/>
            The third kind are the ring-straked and speckled; and what <lb/>
            man in his senses would deny that these also are, as to their <lb/>
            genus, variegated ? but still he is not so very eager about the <lb/>
            varieties of the members of the flocks, as about the road <lb/>
            which leads to virtue and excellence ; for the prophet intends <lb/>
            that he who proceeds along this road shall be besprinkled with <lb/>
            dust and water ; because it is related that the earth and water <lb/>
            being kneaded together and fashioned into shape by the <lb/>
            Creator of man, was formed into one body, not being'made by <lb/>
            hand, but being the work of invisible nature.</p>
          <p>Therefore it is the first principle of wisdom not to forget <lb/>
            one's self, and always to keep before one's eyes the materials of <lb/>
            which one has been compounded; for in this way a man will <lb/>
            get rid of boasting and arrogance, which of all evils is the <lb/>
            one most hated by God ; for who that ever admits into his <lb/>
            mind the recollection that the first principles of his formation <lb/>
            are dust and water, would ever be so puffed by vanity as to be <lb/>
            unduly elated ? On this account the prophet has thought it <lb/>
            fit that those who are about to offer sacrifice shall be be <lb/>
             <pb n="337"/>
            sprinkled with the aforesaid things ; thinking no one worthy <lb/>
            to appear at a sacrifice who has not first of all learnt to know <lb/>
            himself, and to comprehend the nothingness of mankind, and <lb/>
            the elements of which he is composed, conjecturing from them <lb/>
            that he himself is utterly insignificant.</p>
          <p>XXXVII. These three signs, the white, the variegated, and <lb/>
            the ring-straked and speckled, are as yet imperfect in the <lb/>
            practiser of virtue, who has not himself as yet attained to <lb/>
            perfection. But, in the case of him who is perfect, they also <lb/>
            appear to be perfect. And in what manner they appear so we <lb/>
            will examine. The sacred scripture has appointed that the <lb/>
            great High Priest, when he was about to perform the minis­ <lb/>
            trations appointed by the law, should be besprinkled with water <lb/>
            and ashes in the first place, that he might come to a remem­ <lb/>
            brance of himself. For the wise Abraham also, when he went <lb/>
            forth to converse with God, pronounced himself to be dust and <lb/>
            ashes. In the second place, it enjoins him to put on a tunic <lb/>
            reaching down to his feet, and the variously-embroidered thing <lb/>
            which was called his breast-plate, an image and representation <lb/>
            of the light-giving stars which appear in heaven.</p>
          <p>For there are, as it seems, two temples belonging to God; <lb/>
            one being this world, in which the high priest is the divine <lb/>
            word, his own first-born son. The other is the rational soul, <lb/>
            the priest of which is the real true man, the copy of whom, <lb/>
            perceptible to the senses, is he who performs his paternal vows <lb/>
            and sacrifices, to whom it is enjoined to put on the aforesaid <lb/>
            tunic, the representation of the universal heaven, in order that <lb/>
            the world may join with the man in offering sacrifice, and that <lb/>
            the man may likewise co-operate with the universe.</p>
          <p>He is now therefore shown to have these two things, the <lb/>
            speckled and the variegated character. We will now proceed <lb/>
            to explain the third and most perfect kind, which is denomi­ <lb/>
            nated thoroughly white. When this same high priest enters <lb/>
            into the innermost parts of the holy temple, he is clothed in the <lb/>
            variegated garment, and he also assumes another linen robe, <lb/>
            made of the very finest flax. And this is an emblem of vigour, <lb/>
            and incorruptibility, and the most brilliant light. For such a <lb/>
            veil is a thing very difficult to be broken, and it is made of <lb/>
            nothing mortal, and when it is properly and carefully purified <lb/>
            it has a most clear and brilliant appearance. And these in­ <lb/>
            junctions contain this figurative meaning, that of those who In <note type="footnote"> VOL. II. </note> <note type="footnote"> z </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="338"/>
            a pure and guileless spirit serve the living God, there is no <lb/>
            one who does not at first depend upon the firmness and <lb/>
            obstinacy of his mind, despising all human affairs, which allure <lb/>
            men with their specious bait, and injure them, and produce <lb/>
            weakness in them. In the next place, he aims at immortality, <lb/>
            laughing at the blind inventions with which mortals delude <lb/>
            themselves. And last of all, he shines with the unclouded and <lb/>
            most brilliant light of truth, no longer desiring any of the <lb/>
            things which belong to false opinion, which prefer darkness <lb/>
            rather than light.</p>
          <p>XXXVIII. The great high priest of the confession, then, <lb/>
            may have now been sufficiently described by us, being stamped <lb/>
            with the impressions above-mentioned, the white, the varie­ <lb/>
            gated, and the ring-straked and speckled. But he who is <lb/>
            desirous of the administration of human affairs, by name Joseph, <lb/>
            does not, as it appears, claim for himself any of the extreme <lb/>
            characteristics, but only that variegated one which is in the <lb/>
            middle between the others. For we read that Joseph had a <lb/>
            coat of many colours,"* not being sprinkled with the sacred <lb/>
            purifications, by means of which he might have known that he <lb/>
            himself was only a compound of dust and water, and not being <lb/>
            able to touch that thoroughly white and most shining raiment,­ <lb/>
            virtue. But being clothed in the much-variegated web of <lb/>
            political affairs, with which the smallest possible portion of <lb/>
            truth is mixed up; and also many and large portions of <lb/>
            plausible, probable, and likely falsehoods, from which all the <lb/>
            sophists of Egypt, and all the augurs, and ventriloquists, and <lb/>
            sorcerers spring ; men skilful in juggling, and in incantations, <lb/>
            and in tricks of all 'kinds, from whose treacherous arts it is very <lb/>
            difficult to escape.</p>
          <p>And it is on this account that Moses very naturally repre­ <lb/>
            sents this robe as stained with blood ; since the whole life of <lb/>
            the man who is mixed up in political affairs is tainted, warring <lb/>
            on others and being warred against, and being aimed at, and <lb/>
            attacked, and shot at by all the unexpected chances which be­ <lb/>
            fall him.</p>
          <p>Examine now the man who has great influence with the <lb/>
            people, on whom the affairs of the city depend. Do not be <lb/>
            alarmed at those who look with admiration upon him ; and you <lb/>
            will find many diseases lurking within him, and you will see <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xxxvii. 3. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="339"/>
            that he is entangled in many disasters, and that fortune is <lb/>
            dragging him violently in different directions, though he bends <lb/>
            his neck the other way, and resists, although invisibly, and in <lb/>
            fact that fortune is seeking to overthrow and destroy him; or <lb/>
            else the people themselves are impatient at his supremacy, or <lb/>
            he is exposed to the attacks of some more powerful rival. And <lb/>
            envy is a formidable enemy, and one hard to be shaken off, <lb/>
            clinging also to everything that is called good fortune, and it <lb/>
            is not easy to escape from it.</p>
          <p>XXXIX. What reason is there then for our congratulating <lb/>
            ourselves on the administration of political affairs as if we were <lb/>
            clothed in a garment of many colours, deceived by its external <lb/>
            splendour, and not perceiving its ugliness, which is kept out of <lb/>
            sight, and hidden, and full of treachery and guile? Let us <lb/>
            then put off this flowery robe, and put on that sacred one woven <lb/>
            with the embroideries of virtue; for thus we shall escape the <lb/>
            snares which want of skill, and ignorance, and want of know­ <lb/>
            ledge, and education lay for us, of which Laban is the com­ <lb/>
            panion. For when the sacred word has purified us with the <lb/>
            sprinklings prepared beforehand for purification, and when <lb/>
            it has adorned us with the select reasonings of true philosophy, <lb/>
            and, having led us to that man who has stood the test, has <lb/>
            made us genuine, and conspicuous, and shining, it blames the <lb/>
            treacherous disposition which seeks to raise itself up to <lb/>
            invalidate what is said.</p>
          <p>For the scripture says: "I have seen what Laban does <lb/>
            unto thee,"* namely, things contrary to the benefits which I <lb/>
            conferred on you, things impure, wicked, and altogether suited <lb/>
            to darkness. But it is not right for the man who anchors on <lb/>
            the hope of the alliance of God to crouch and tremble, to whom <lb/>
            God says, " I am the God who was seen by thee in. the place <lb/>
            of God." A very glorious boast for the soul, that God should <lb/>
            think fit to appear to and to converse with it. And do not <lb/>
            pass by what is here said, but examine it accurately, and see <lb/>
            whether there are really two Gods. For it is said : " I am the <lb/>
            God who was seen by thee; " not in my place, but in the place <lb/>
            of God, as if he meant of some other God.</p>
          <p>What then'ought we to say? There is one true God only: <lb/>
            but they who are called Gods, by an abuse of language, are <lb/>
            numerous ; on which account the holy scripture on the present <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xxxi. 12. </note> <note type="footnote"> z 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="340"/>
            occasion indicates that it is the true Gocl that is meant by the <lb/>
            use of the article, the expression being, " I am the God <lb/>
            (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ὁ Θεὸς</foreign>);" but when the word is used incorrectly, it is put <lb/>
            without the article, the expression being, " He who was seen <lb/>
            by thee in the place," not of the God (<foreign xml:lang="grc">του̃ Θεου̃</foreign>), but simply <lb/>
            "of God" (<foreign xml:lang="grc">Θεου̃</foreign>); and what he here calls God is his most <lb/>
            ancient word, not having any superstitious regard to the <lb/>
            position of the names, but only proposing one end to himself, <lb/>
            namely, to give a true account of the matter; for in other <lb/>
            passages the sacred historian, when he considered whether <lb/>
            there really was any name belonging to the living God, showed <lb/>
            that he knew that there was none properly belonging to him; <lb/>
            but that whatever appellation any one may give him, will be an <lb/>
            abuse of terms; for the living God is not of a nature to be <lb/>
            described, but only to be.</p>
          <p>XL. And a proof of this may be found in the oracular <lb/>
            answer given by God to the person who asked what name he <lb/>
            had, "I am that I am,"* that the questioner might know the <lb/>
            existence of those things which it was not possible for man to <lb/>
            conceive not being connected with God. Accordingly, to the <lb/>
            incorporeal souls which are occupied in his service, it is natural <lb/>
            for him to appear as he is, conversing with them as a friend <lb/>
            with his friends ; but to those souls which are still in the body <lb/>
            lie must appear in the resemblance of the angels, though <lb/>
            without changing his nature (for he is unchangeable), but <lb/>
            merely implanting in those who behold him an idea of his <lb/>
            having another form, so that they fancy that it is his image, <lb/>
            not an imitation of him, but the very archetypal appearance <lb/>
            itself.</p>
          <p>There is then an old story much celebrated, that the Divinity, <lb/>
            assuming the resemblance of men of different countries, goes <lb/>
            round the different cities of men, searching out the deeds of <lb/>
            iniquity and lawlessness; and perhaps, though the fable is not <lb/>
            true, it is a suitable and profitable one. But the scripture, <lb/>
            which at all times advances its conceptions with respect to the <lb/>
            Deity, in a more reverential and holy tone, and which likewise <lb/>
            desires to instruct the life of the foolish, has spoken of God <lb/>
            under the likeness of a man, though not of any particular man ; <lb/>
            attributing to him, with this view, the possession of a face, and <lb/>
            hands, and feet, and of a mouth and voice, and also anger and <note type="footnote"> * Exodus in. 14. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="341"/>
            passion, and moreover, defensive weapons, and goings in and <lb/>
            goings out, and motions upwards and downwards, and in every <lb/>
            direction, not indeed using all these expressions with strict <lb/>
            truth, but having regard to the advantage of those who are to <lb/>
            learn from it; for the writers knew that some men are very <lb/>
            dull in their natures, so as to be utterly unable to form any <lb/>
            conception whatever of God apart from a body, whom it <lb/>
            would he impossible to admonish if they were to speak in any <lb/>
            other style than the existing one, of representing God as <lb/>
            coming and departing like a man; and as descending and <lb/>
            ascending, and as using his voice, and as being angry with <lb/>
            sinners, and being implacable in his anger; and speaking too <lb/>
            of his darts and swords, and whatever other instruments <lb/>
            are suitable to be employed against the wicked, as being all <lb/>
            previously ready.</p>
          <p>For we must be content if such men can be brought to a <lb/>
            proper state, by the fear which is suspended over them by such <lb/>
            descriptions; and one may almost say that these are the only <lb/>
            two paths taken, in the whole history of the law; one leading <lb/>
            to the plain truth, owing to which we have such assertions as, <lb/>
            " God is not as a man ;"* the other, that which has regard to <lb/>
            the opinions of foolish men, in reference to whom it is said, <lb/>
            " The Lord God shall instruct you, like as if a man instructs <lb/>
            his son."†</p>
          <p>XLI. Why then do we any longer wonder, if God at times <lb/>
            assumes the likeness of the angels, as he sometimes assumes <lb/>
            even that of men, for the sake of assisting those who address <lb/>
            their entreaties to him so that when he says, " I am the God <lb/>
            who was seen by thee in the place of God;"‡ we must under­ <lb/>
            stand this, that he on that occasion took the place of an angel, <lb/>
            as far as appearance went, without changing his own real <lb/>
            nature, for the advantage of him who was not, as yet, able to <lb/>
            bear the sight of the true God; for as those who are not able <lb/>
            to look upon the sun itself, look upon the reflected rays of the <lb/>
            sun as the sun itself, and upon the halo around the moon as if <lb/>
            it were the moon itself; so also do those who are unable to <lb/>
            bear the sight of God, look upon his image, his angel word, as <lb/>
            himself.</p>
          <p>Do you not see that encyclical instruction, that is, Hagar, <note type="footnote"> * Numbers xxiii. 19. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Deut. i. 31. </note> <note type="footnote"> ‡ Genesis xxxi. 13. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="342"/>
            says to the ahgel, "Art thou God who seest me?"* for she was <lb/>
            not capable of beholding the most ancient cau"e, inasmuch as <lb/>
            she was by birth a native of Egypt. But now the mind begins <lb/>
            to be improved, so as to be able to contemplate the governor <lb/>
            of all the powers; on which account he says himself, " I am <lb/>
            the Lord God,"t I whose image you formerly beheld instead <lb/>
            of me, and whose pillar you set up, engraving on it a most <lb/>
            sacred inscription; and the inscription indicated that I stood <lb/>
            alone, and that I established the nature of all things, bringing <lb/>
            disorder and irregularity into order and regularity, and sup­ <lb/>
            porting the universe firmly, so that it might rest on a firm and <lb/>
            solid foundation, my own ministering word.</p>
          <p>XLII. For the pillar is the symbol of three things ; of <lb/>
            standing, of dedication, and of an inscription: now the standing <lb/>
            and the inscription have been described, but the dedication it is <lb/>
            necessary should be explained to all men. For heaven and <lb/>
            the world are an offering dedicated to God who made them; <lb/>
            and all the cosmopolitan and God-loving souls, which dedicate <lb/>
            and consecrate themselves to him, not allowing any mortal <lb/>
            thing to drag them in an opposite direction, are never weary of <lb/>
            hallowing their own life, and adorning it with every kind <lb/>
            of beauty as a meet offering for him. And he is a foolish man <lb/>
            who does not set up a pillar to God, but who erects one to <lb/>
            himself instead, attributing stability to the things of creation, <lb/>
            which is tossed about in every direction, and thinking those <lb/>
            things worthy of inscriptions and panegyrics, which are in <lb/>
            reality full of matter for blame and accusation, and which as <lb/>
            such had better never have been mentioned in an inscription <lb/>
            at all, or if they had, had better have been speedily erased <lb/>
            again.</p>
          <p>On which account the holy scripture says distinctly, " Thou <lb/>
            shalt not set up a pillar to thyself;"‡ for in truth there is <lb/>
            nothing belonging to man that is stable, no, not though some <lb/>
            persons persist even so obstinately in affirming it. But they <lb/>
            not only think that they stand firmly, but also that they are <lb/>
            worthy of honours and inscriptions, forgetting him who is <lb/>
            alone worthy of honour, and who is alone firmly fixed ; for <lb/>
            while they are turning aside and wandering away from the path <lb/>
            which leads to virtue, the outward sense leads them still more <lb/>
            astray, that is to say, the woman who is akin to them, she also <note type="footnote">* Genesis xvi. 13. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Genesis xxxi. 13. </note> <note type="footnote"> ‡ Deut.. xvi. 22. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="343"/>
            compels them to run ashore; therefore, the whole soul, like a <lb/>
            ship,* being shut in all around, is offered up as a pillar; for <lb/>
            the sacred scriptures tell us that Lot's wife having turned back <lb/>
            to look behind her, became a pillar of salt, and this is said <lb/>
            very naturally and fitly; for if any one does not look forwards <lb/>
            at those things which are worthy of being seen and heard (and <lb/>
            these things are the virtues and the actions done in accordance <lb/>
            with virtue), but looks backwards at the things which are <lb/>
            behind him, at deaf glory, and blind riches, and senseless <lb/>
            vigour of body, and an empty elegance of mind, pursuing <lb/>
            these objects only, and such as are akin to them, he will lie <lb/>
            as a lifeless pillar melting away by itself; for salt is not a <lb/>
            thing to preserve his firmness.</p>
          <p>XLIII. Very admirably therefore does the practiser of vir­ <lb/>
            tue, having learnt by continued study that creation is a thing <lb/>
            in its own nature moveable, but that the uncreated God is <lb/>
            unchangeable and immoveable, erect a pillar to God, and <lb/>
            anoint it after he has erected it; for God says, " Thou hast <lb/>
            anointed my pillar."t But do not fancy that that stone was <lb/>
            anointed with oil, but understand rather that that opinion, <lb/>
            that God is the only being who stands firmly, was thoroughly <lb/>
            hardened by exercise, and established in the soul by the <lb/>
            science of wrestling, not that science by which bodies are <lb/>
            made fat, but that by which the mind acquires strength and <lb/>
            irresistible vigour; for the man who is eager in the pursuit of <lb/>
            good studies and virtuous objects is fond of labours, and fond <lb/>
            of exercises; so that very naturally, having worked out the <lb/>
            science of training- which is the sister of the art of medicine, <lb/>
            he anoints and brings to perfection all the reasonings of <lb/>
            virtue and piety, and dedicates them, as a most beautiful and <lb/>
            lasting offering to God.</p>
          <p>For this reason, after mentioning the dedication of the pillar, <lb/>
            God adds that, " Thou vowedst avow to me." Now a vow also <lb/>
            is, to speak properly, a dedication, since he who makes a vow <lb/>
            is said to offer up, as a gift to God, not only his own posses­ <lb/>
            sions, but himself likewise, who is the owner of them ; for says <lb/>
            the scripture, " the man is holy who nourishes the locks of the <lb/>
            hair of his head; who has vowed a vow." But if he is holy he <note type="footnote"> * Mangey thinks that this passage is corrupt, and proposes to alter <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ναυ̃ς</foreign> into <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἄπνους</foreign>, "dead," but it seems unnecessary. </note><note type="footnote"> t Genesis xxxi. 13. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="344"/>
            is undoubtedly an offering to God, no longer meddling with <lb/>
            anything unholy or profane ; and there is an evidence in favour <lb/>
            of my argument, in the conduct of the prophetess, and mother <lb/>
            of a prophet, Hannah, whose name being translated, signifies <lb/>
            grace ; for she says that she gives her son, " Samuel, as a gift <lb/>
            to the Holy One,"* not dedicating him more as a human being, <lb/>
            than as a disposition full of inspiration, and possessed by a <lb/>
            d vinely sent impulse; and the name Samuel being interpreted <lb/>
            means, " appointed to God."</p>
          <p>Why then, 0 my soul, do you any longer waste yourself in <lb/>
            vain speculations and labours? and why do you not go as a <lb/>
            pupil to the practiser of virtue, taking up arms against the <lb/>
            passions, and against vain opinion, to learn from him the way <lb/>
            to wrestle with them ? For as soon as you have learnt this <lb/>
            art, you will become the leader of a flock, not of one which <lb/>
            is destitute of marks, and of reason, and of docility, but of one <lb/>
            which is well approved, and rational, and beautiful, of which, <lb/>
            if you become the leader, you will pity the miserable race of <lb/>
            mankind, and will not cease to reverence the Deity; and you <lb/>
            will never be weary of blessing God, and moreover you will <lb/>
            engrave hymns suited to your sacred subject upon pillars, that <lb/>
            you may not only speak fluently, but may also sing musically <lb/>
            the virtues of the living God ; for by these means you will be <lb/>
            able to return to your father's house, being delivered from a <lb/>
            long and profitless wandering in a foreign land.</p>

          <p>I. IN describing the third species of dreams which are sent <lb/>
            from God, we very naturally call on Moses as an ally, in order <lb/>
            that as he learnt, having previously been ignorant, so lie may <lb/>
            instruct us who are also ignorant, concerning these signs, illus­ <lb/>
            trating each separate one of them. <note type="footnote"> * I Samuel i. 28. </note> <pb n="345"/>
            </p>
          <p>Now this third species of dreams exists, whenever in sleep <lb/>
            the mind being set in motion by itself, and agitating itself, is <lb/>
            filled with frenzy and inspiration, so as to predict future events <lb/>
            by a certain prophetic power. For the first kind of dreams <lb/>
            which we mentioned, was that which proceeded from God as <lb/>
            the author of its motion, and, as some invisible manner <lb/>
            prompted us what was indistinct to us, but well known to him­ <lb/>
            self. The second kind was when our own intellect was set <lb/>
            in motion simultaneously with the soul of the universe, and <lb/>
            became filled with divine madness, by means of which it is <lb/>
            allowed to prognosticate events which are about to happen; <lb/>
            and for this reason the interpreter of the sacred will very <lb/>
            plainly and clearly speaks of dreams, indicating by this expres­ <lb/>
            sion the visions which appear according to the first species, as <lb/>
            if God, by means of dreams, gave suggestions which were <lb/>
            equivalent to distinct and precise oracles. Of the visions <lb/>
            according to the second species he speaks neither very clearly <lb/>
            nor very obscurely; an instance of which is afforded by the <lb/>
            vision which was exhibited of the ladder reaching up to heaven; <lb/>
            for this vision was an enigmatical one ; nevertheless, the <lb/>
            meaning was not hidden from those who were able to see with <lb/>
            any great acuteness.</p>
          <p>But these visions which are afforded according to the third <lb/>
            species of dreams, being less clear than the two former kinds <lb/>
            by reason of their having an enigmatical meaning deeply <lb/>
            seated and fully coloured, require the science of an interpreter <lb/>
            of dreams. At all events all the dreams of this class, which <lb/>
            are recorded by the lawgiver, are interpreted by men who are <lb/>
            skilled in the aforesaid art.</p>
          <p>Whose dreams then am I here alluding to ? Surely every <lb/>
            one must see to those of Joseph, and of Pharaoh king of <lb/>
            Egypt, and to those which the chief baker and the chief butler <lb/>
            saw themselves ; and it may be well at all times to begin our <lb/>
            instruction with the first instances.</p>
          <p>Now the first dreams are those which Joseph beheld, <lb/>
            receiving two visions from the two parts of the world, heaven <lb/>
            and earth. From the earth the dream about the harvest; and <lb/>
            that is as follows, " I thought that we were all binding sheaves <lb/>
            in the middle of the field; and my sheaf stood up."* And <lb/>
            the other relates to the circle of the zodiac, and is, " They <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xxxvii. 7. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="346"/>
            worshipped me as the sun and the moon and the eleven stars." <lb/>
            And the interpretation of the former one, which was delivered <lb/>
            with great violence of reproof, is as follows, " Shall you be a <lb/>
            king and reign over us? or shall you be a lord and lord it over <lb/>
            us?" The interpretation of the second is again full of just <lb/>
            indignation, " Shall I, and thy mother, and thy brethren come <lb/>
            and fall down upon the ground and worship thee ?"</p>
          <p>II. Let these things be laid down first by way of founda­ <lb/>
            tion ; and on this foundation let us raise up the rest of the <lb/>
            building, following the rules of that wise architect, allegory, <lb/>
            and accurately investigating each particular of the dreams; <lb/>
            but first we must mention what it is requisite should be <lb/>
            attended to before the dreams. Some persons have extended <lb/>
            the nature of good over many things, and others have <lb/>
            attributed it to the most excellent Being atone ; some again <lb/>
            have mixed it with other things, while others have spoken of <lb/>
            it as unalloyed.</p>
          <p>Those then who have called only what is honourable good, <lb/>
            have preserved this nature free from alloy, and have attributed <lb/>
            it only to what is most excellent, namely to the reason that is in <lb/>
            us; but those who have mixed it have combined it with three <lb/>
            things, the soul, the body, and external circumstances. And <lb/>
            they who act thus are persons of a somewhat effeminate and <lb/>
            luxurious way of life, being bred up the greater part of their <lb/>
            time, from their earliest infancy, in the women's apartments <lb/>
            and among the effeminate race which is found in the women's <lb/>
            apartments. But those who argue differently are men inclined <lb/>
            to a harder regimen, being bred up from their boyhood among <lb/>
            men, and being themselves men in their minds, embracing <lb/>
            what is right in preference to what is pleasant, and devoting <lb/>
            themselves to nourishment fit for athletes for the sake of <lb/>
            strength and vigour, not of pleasure.</p>
          <p>Moses moreover represents two persons as leaders of these <lb/>
            two companies. The leader of the noble and good company <lb/>
            is the self-taught and self-instructed Isaac; for he records <lb/>
            that he was weaned, not choosing to avail himself at all of ten­ <lb/>
            der, and milk-like, and childish, and infantine food, but only <lb/>
            of such as was vigorous and perfect, inasmuch as he was <lb/>
            formed by nature, from his very infancy, for acts of virtue, <lb/>
            and was always in the prime and vigour of youth and energy. <lb/>
            But the leader of the company, which yields and which is <lb/>
             <pb n="347"/>
            inclined to softer measures, is Joseph; for he does not indeed <lb/>
            neglect the virtues of the soul, but he likewise shows anxiety <lb/>
            about the stability and permanence of the body, and also de­ <lb/>
            sires an abundance of worldly treasures; and it is in strict <lb/>
            accordance with natural truth, that he is represented as drawn <lb/>
            in different directions, since he proposes to himself many dif­ <lb/>
            ferent objects in life; and being attracted by each of them, he <lb/>
            is kept in a state of commotion and agitation, without being <lb/>
            able to stand firm.</p>
          <p>And his case is not like that of cities, which having made a <lb/>
            truce enjoy peace, and yet after a time are again attacked, so <lb/>
            as to gain the victory and to be defeated alternately; for at <lb/>
            times a great influx of riches and glory coming upon them, <lb/>
            subdues all their cares for the body and the soul, but after­ <lb/>
            wards, being repelled by both these things, they are conquered <lb/>
            by the adversary ; and in the same manner all the pleasures <lb/>
            of the body coming upon the soul in a compact array over­ <lb/>
            whelm and efface all the objects of the intellect one after the <lb/>
            other; and then, after a short time, wisdom, changing its <lb/>
            course and blowing in the opposite direction with a fresh and <lb/>
            violent breeze, causes the stream of the pleasures to slacken, <lb/>
            and altogether moderates all the eagerness, and impetuosity, <lb/>
            and rivalry of the external senses.</p>
          <p>Such a circle then of never-ending war revolves around the <lb/>
            soul, subject as it is to so many changes; for when one <lb/>
            enemy has been destroyed, then immediately there springs up <lb/>
            another more powerful, after the fashion of the many-headed <lb/>
            hydra; for they say, that in the case of this monster, instead <lb/>
            of the head which was cut off another sprung up, by which <lb/>
            statement they mean to intimate the multiform, and prolific, <lb/>
            and almost invincible character of undying wickedness.</p>
          <p>Do not, therefore, answer Joseph .......* but <lb/>
            know that he is the image of multiform and mixed knowledge. <lb/>
            For there appears in him a rational species of continence, <lb/>
            which is of the masculine kind, being fashioned in accordance <lb/>
            with his father Jacob; and also that kind which is devoid of <lb/>
            reason is likewise visible, that of the outward sense I mean, <lb/>
            being made in the likeness of his maternal race, according to <lb/>
            Rachel. There appears in him also the seed of bodily plea­ <note type="footnote"> * There is an hiatus here, and there is a good deal of corruption <lb/>
            about the beginning of this book. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="348"/>
            sure, which his association with the chief butlers, and chief <lb/>
            bakers, and chief cooks has stamped upon him. There is, <lb/>
            also visible the seed of vain opinion, on which he mounts as <lb/>
            on a chariot by reason of his levity, being puffed up, and <lb/>
            elated, and raising himself to a height to the destruction of <lb/>
            equality.</p>
          <p>III. Now the character of Joseph is sketched out by the <lb/>
            foregoing outlines. But each of his dreams must be investi­ <lb/>
            gated with accuracy; and first of all we must examine the one <lb/>
            about the sheaves. " I thought," says he, " that we were all <lb/>
            binding sheaves." The expression, "I thought," is clearly <lb/>
            that of a person who is not certain, but who is hesitating and <lb/>
            supposing with some amount of indistinctness, not of one who <lb/>
            sees positively and clearly; for it is very natural for persons <lb/>
            just awakening out of a deep sleep, and still dozing as it were, <lb/>
            to say, " I thought;" but not so for people who are thoroughly <lb/>
            awake, and who can see distinctly. And the practiser of <lb/>
            virtue, Jacob, does not say, " I thought," but his language is, <lb/>
            " Behold, a ladder firmly set, the head of which reached up to <lb/>
            heaven."* And again he says, when " the sheep conceived <lb/>
            1 saw them with my eyes in my sleep, and behold the lie-goats <lb/>
            and the rams leapt upon the ewes and upon the she-goats, <lb/>
            white, and variegated, and ring-straked, and speckled."t <lb/>
            For it happens of necessity that the sleeping conceptions also <lb/>
            of those who think what is honourable eligible for its own sake <lb/>
            are more distinct and more pure, just as their waking actions <lb/>
            are also more deserving of approbation.</p>
          <p>IV. But when I hear Joseph relating his dream I marvel <lb/>
            at his having fancied that he was binding up the sheaves, and <lb/>
            not reaping the corn; for the one is the task of the lower <lb/>
            classes and of servants, but the other is the occupation of the <lb/>
            employers, and of men more skilled in agriculture. For to be <lb/>
            able to distinguish what is necessary from what is mischievous, <lb/>
            and what is nutritious from what is not so, and what is <lb/>
            genuine from what is spurious, and useful fruit from a worth­ <lb/>
            less root, not only in reference to those things which the land <lb/>
            bears, but also in those which the intellect bears, is the work <lb/>
            of most perfect virtue. Accordingly the holy scripture repre­ <lb/>
            sents those who see, that is the sons of Israel, as reaping, and <lb/>
            what is a most extraordinary thing, as reaping not barley or <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xxviii. 12. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Genesis xxxi. 10. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="349"/>
            wheat, but the harvest itself; accordingly the language of <lb/>
            Moses is, " When you reap your harvest, you shall not wholly <lb/>
            reap the corners of your harvest."* For he means here that <lb/>
            the virtuous man is not merely the judge of things which <lb/>
            differ from one another, and that he does not only distinguish <lb/>
            the things from which some produce is derived from the <lb/>
            produce itself; bat that he is able also to distinguish while <lb/>
            reaping the harvest, to remove this opinion of his ability to <lb/>
            distinguish, and to eradicate a man's own opinion of himself; <lb/>
            because he is firmly persuaded, and believes Moses when he <lb/>
            affirms that judgment belongs to God alone,"t with whom <lb/>
            are the comparisons and distinctions between all things ; to <lb/>
            whom it is well for a man to confess that he is inferior, a con­ <lb/>
            fession more glorious than the most renowned victory.</p>
          <p>Now the reaping a harvest is like cutting a second time <lb/>
            what has been cut already ; which when some persons fond <lb/>
            of novelty applied themselves to they found a circumcision of <lb/>
            circumcision, and a purification of purification;‡ that is to say, <lb/>
            they found that the purification of the soul was itself purified, <lb/>
            attributing the power of making bright to God, and never <lb/>
            fancying that they themselves were competent, without the <lb/>
            assistance of the divine wisdom, to wash and cleanse a life <lb/>
            which is full of stains.</p>
          <p>Akin to this is the double cave, which is a symbol of the <lb/>
            twofold and excellent recollections (the one existing in refer­ <lb/>
            ence to the creature, and the other to the Creator), in which <lb/>
            the virtuous mail is bred up, contemplating the things which <lb/>
            are in the world, and being also fond of inquiring about the <lb/>
            father who made them; and it is owing to these twofold <lb/>
            recollections, in my opinion, that the double symphony in <lb/>
            music, that of the double diapason, was invented. For it was <lb/>
            necessary that the work and the creator should be made happy <lb/>
            in two most perfect melodies, and not both in the same one. <lb/>
            For since the excellencies which were to be celebrated by <lb/>
            them differed from one another, it followed of necessity that <lb/>
            the melodies and symphonies should likewise differ from one <lb/>
            another. The combined symphony being assigned to the <lb/>
            world, which is a compound creation, composed of many <lb/>
            different parts ; and the disjoined melody being appropriated <note type="footnote"> * Leviticu9 xix. 9. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Deut. i. 17. </note> <note type="footnote"> ‡Numbers vi. 2. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="350"/>
            to him who, as to his essence, is separated from every creature, <lb/>
            namely, to God.</p>
          <p>Moreover, the interpreter of the sacred will again enunciates <lb/>
            an opinion friendly to virtue, saying that it is not proper " to <lb/>
            thoroughly reap every corner of the harvest field;" remember­ <lb/>
            ing the original proposition, according to which he agreed <lb/>
            that " the tribute belonged to the Lord,"* to whom the <lb/>
            authority and the conformation of these things also belong ; <lb/>
            but he who is uninitiated in reaping boasts, so far as to say, <lb/>
            " I thought that I was with the others binding up the sheaves <lb/>
            which I had reaped."t And he does'not consider that this is <lb/>
            the occupation of servants and of unskilful hands, as I have <lb/>
            said a little while ago. But this word sheaves is un allegori­ <lb/>
            cal expression by which affairs are really meant, such as each <lb/>
            man takes in hand for the support of his house, in which he <lb/>
            hopes to live and dwell for ever.</p>
          <p>V. There are, therefore, an infinite number of differences <lb/>
            between sheaves, that is to say, between such affairs as support <lb/>
            a house. There are also a countless host of differences <lb/>
            between those who gather and take up the sheaves in their <lb/>
            hand, so that it is impossible to mention or even to imagine <lb/>
            them all. Still it is not out of place to describe a few of <lb/>
            them by way of example, which lie too mentioned, when he <lb/>
            was recounting his dream. For he says to his brethren, " I <lb/>
            thought that we were binding up sheaves." Now, of brethren <lb/>
            he has ten, who are sons of the same father as himself, and <lb/>
            one who is by the same mother; and the name of each <lb/>
            individual among them is an emblem of some most necessary <lb/>
            thing. Reuben is an emblem of natural acuteness, for he is <lb/>
            called " the soil who sees," being in so far as he is a son not <lb/>
            perfect, but in so far as he is endowed with the faculty of sight <lb/>
            and sees acutely, he is naturally well qualiefid. Simeon is an <lb/>
            emblem of learning, for his name being interpreted means, <lb/>
            " listening." Levi is a symbol of virtuous energies and <lb/>
            actions, and of holy ministrations. Judas is an emblem of <lb/>
            songs and hymns addressed to God. Issachar, of wages <lb/>
            which are given for good works ; but perhaps the works them­ <lb/>
            selves are their own perfect reward. Zabulon is a symbol of <lb/>
            light, since his name means the departure of night; and <lb/>
            when the night departs and leaves us, then of necessity light <note type="footnote"> * Numbers xxxi. 28. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Genesis xxxvii. 7. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="351"/>
            arises. Dan is a symbol of the distinction between, and <lb/>
            division of, different things. Gad is an emblem of the <lb/>
            invasion of pirates, and of a counter attack made upon them. <lb/>
            Asser is a symbol of natural wealth, for his name being inter­ <lb/>
            preted, signifies " a calling blessed," since wealth is accounted <lb/>
            a blessed possession. Napthali is a symbol of peace, for all <lb/>
            things are opened and extended by peace, as on the other <lb/>
            hand they are closed by war ; and his name being interpreted <lb/>
            means, " widening," or " that which is opened." Benjamin is <lb/>
            an emblem of young and old time ; for being interpreted his <lb/>
            name means " the soil of days," and both young time and old <lb/>
            time are measured by days and nights.</p>
          <p>Accordingly, every one of them takes up in his hand what <lb/>
            belongs to himself; and having taken it up, binds all the <lb/>
            parts together; the man well endowed by nature taking up <lb/>
            the parts of dexterity, and perseverance, and memory, of <lb/>
            which good natural endowments consist; the man who has <lb/>
            learnt well takes up the parts of listening, tranquillity, and <lb/>
            attention; the man willing to endeavour takes up courage <lb/>
            and a happy confidence which does not shrink from danger; <lb/>
            the man inclined to gratitude takes up praises, panegyrics, <lb/>
            hymns, and blessings, both in speaking and in singing; the <lb/>
            - man who is eager for wages takes up unhesitating industry, <lb/>
            most enduring gratitude, and care, armed with a promptitude <lb/>
            which is not to be despised ; he who pursues light rather than <lb/>
            darkness takes up wakefulness and acuteness of sight; the <lb/>
            man who is an admirer of the division of and distinction <lb/>
            between things takes up well-sharpened reasons so as not to <lb/>
            be deceived by things similar to one another as if they were <lb/>
            identical, impartiality so as riot to be led away by favour, and <lb/>
            incorruptibility; he who, in something of a piratical fashion, <lb/>
            lays ambuscades against those who counterplot against him, takes <lb/>
            up deceit, cajolery, trickery, sophistry, pretence, and hypocrisy, <lb/>
            which being in their own nature blamable, are nevertheless <lb/>
            praised when employed against an enemy ; he who studies to <lb/>
            be rich in the riches of nature takes up temperance and fru­ <lb/>
            gality ; he who loves peace takes up obedience to law, a good <lb/>
            reputation, freedom from pride, and equality.</p>
          <p>VI. It is of these things, then, that the sheaves of his <lb/>
            brethren by the same father are composed and bound up; but <lb/>
             <pb n="352"/>
            the sheaf of his uterine brother is composed of days and of <lb/>
            time, which are the causes of nothing, as if they were the <lb/>
            causes of all things. But the dreamer and interpreter of <lb/>
            dreams himself, for he united both characters, makes a sheaf <lb/>
            of empty opinion as of the greatest and most brilliant of pos­ <lb/>
            sessions and the most useful to life. For which reason it is <lb/>
            originally by his dreams, which are things dear to night, that <lb/>
            he is made known to the king of the bodily country, and not <lb/>
            by any performance of conspicuous actions, which require day <lb/>
            for their exhibition. After that, he is appointed overseer or <lb/>
            governor of all Egypt, and is honoured with the second rank <lb/>
            in the kingdom, and made inferior in honour only to the king. <lb/>
            All which things are in the eye of wisdom, if that were the <lb/>
            judge, more inglorious and more ridiculous than even defeat <lb/>
            and dishonour. After that he puts on a golden necklace, a <lb/>
            most illustrious halter, the circlet and wheel of interminable <lb/>
            necessity, not the consequence and regular order of things in <lb/>
            life, nor the connection of th eaffairs of nature as Thamar was ; <lb/>
            for her ornament was not a necklace, but an armlet. More­ <lb/>
            over, he assumes a ring, a royal gift which is no gift, a pledge <lb/>
            devoid of good faith, the very contrary gift to that which was <lb/>
            given to the same Thamar by Judah the son of the seeing <lb/>
            king, Israel; for God gives to the soul a seal, a very beautiful <lb/>
            gift, to show that he has invested with shape the essence of all <lb/>
            things which was previously devoid of shape, and has stamped <lb/>
            with a particular character that which previously had no <lb/>
            character, and has endowed with form that which had pre­ <lb/>
            viously no distinctive form, and having perfected the entire <lb/>
            world, he has impressed upon it an image and appearance, <lb/>
            namely, his own word.</p>
          <p>But Joseph also mounts the second chariot, being puffed up <lb/>
            with elation of mind and vain arrogance. And he is regulator <lb/>
            of the provisions, laying up and preserving the treasures for <lb/>
            the body, and providing it with food from all quarters : and <lb/>
            this is a very formidable fortification against the soul. More­ <lb/>
            over, his deliberate choice of life, and the life which he ad­ <lb/>
            mires, is testified to in no slight degree by his name ; for <lb/>
            Joseph, being interpreted, means "addition;" and vain opinion <lb/>
            is always adding what is spurious to what is genuine, and what <lb/>
            is the property of others to what is one's own, and what is <lb/>
             <pb n="353"/>
            false to what is true, and what is superfluous to what is ade­ <lb/>
            quate, and luxury to what is sufficient to support existence, <lb/>
            and pride to life.</p>
          <p>VII. Consider now what it is which I am here desirous to <lb/>
            prove. We are nourished by meat and drink, even though the <lb/>
            meat be the most ordinary corn, and the drink plain water <lb/>
            from the stream. Moreover, besides this, vain opinion has <lb/>
            added to it an infinite number of varieties of cakes, and <lb/>
            cheese-cakes, and sweetmeats, and costly and various mixtures <lb/>
            of an indescribable multitude of wines, for the enjoyment of <lb/>
            pleasure rather than for a participation in necessary food <lb/>
            properly prepared. Again, the necessary seasonings for eating, <lb/>
            are leeks,* and vegetables, and many fruits of trees, and <lb/>
            cheese, and other things of that sort; and if you wish to <lb/>
            include carnivorous men, we must, besides, add fish and meat <lb/>
            to these items.</p>
          <p>Would it not, then, have been sufficient to broil these things <lb/>
            upon the coals, or to roast them at the fire, and then eat them at <lb/>
            once, after the fashion of those true heroes of old time ? But <lb/>
            the epicure is eager not only for such things as these, but he <lb/>
            takes vain opinion for his ally, and excites the gluttonous pas­ <lb/>
            sions which are within him, and seeks out and hunts all about <lb/>
            for confectioners and pastrycooks of high reputation in their <lb/>
            art. And they, bringing forward the different baits for his <lb/>
            miserable stomach, which have been invented after long con­ <lb/>
            sideration, and preparing all kinds of peculiar flavours, and <lb/>
            arranging them in due order, tickle, and allure, and subdue <lb/>
            the tongue.</p>
          <p>Then, immediately they circumvent that foundation of the <lb/>
            outward senses, the taste, by means of which the banquet­ <lb/>
            hunter in a very short time is rendered a slave instead of a <lb/>
            free man. For who is there who does not know that clothes <lb/>
            were originally made as a defence against the injuries which <lb/>
            might arise to the body from cold and heat ? as the poets <lb/>
            say somewhere :­ <lb/>
            " Taming the wind in the winter." <lb/>
            Who, therefore, thinks of costly purple garments ? Who cares <lb/>
            about transparent and thin summer robes ? Who wishes for a <lb/>
            garment delicate as a spider's web ? Who is eager to have em­ <note type="footnote"> * Numbers xi. 4. </note> <note type="footnote"> VOL. II. </note> <note type="footnote"> A A </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="354"/>
            broidered for him apparel flowered over with dyes and brocaded <lb/>
            figures, by those who are skilful in sewing and weaving cunning <lb/>
            embroidery, and are superior in their handiwork to the imi­ <lb/>
            tative skill of the painter? Who, I say? Who, but vain <lb/>
            opinion ?</p>
          <p>VIII. And, indeed, it is for these same reasons that we had <lb/>
            need of houses, requiring them also for protection against the at­ <lb/>
            tacks of wild beasts, or of men more savage in their nature than <lb/>
            even wild beasts. Why is it, then, that we adorn the pave­ <lb/>
            ments and floors with costly stones ? And why do we travel <lb/>
            over Asia, and Africa, and all Europe, and the islands, search­ <lb/>
            ing for pillars and capitals, and architraves, and selecting them <lb/>
            with reference to their superior beauty ? And why are we <lb/>
            anxious for, and why do we vie with one another in specimens <lb/>
            of Doric, and Ionic, and Corinthian sculpture, and in all the <lb/>
            refinements which luxurious men have devised in addition to <lb/>
            the existing customs, adorning the capitals of their pillars'? <lb/>
            And why do we furnish our chambers for men and for women <lb/>
            with golden ornaments ? Is it not all from our being influ­ <lb/>
            enced by vain opinion ? And yet, for sound sleep, the mere <lb/>
            ground was sufficient (since, even to the present day, the ac­ <lb/>
            counts tell us that the gymnosophists, among the Indians, <lb/>
            sleep on the ground in accordance with their ancient customs); <lb/>
            and if it were not, at all events a couch made of carefully <lb/>
            chosen stones or plain pieces of wood, would be a sufficient <lb/>
            bed; but now the poles of our ladders are ornamented with <lb/>
            ivory feet, and workmen inlay our beds with costly mother-of­ <lb/>
            pearl and variegated tortoise-shell, at great expense of labour, <lb/>
            and money, and time : and some beds are even made of solid <lb/>
            silver or solid gold, and inlaid with precious stones, with all <lb/>
            kinds of flowery work, and embossed golden ornaments <lb/>
            strewed about them, as if for mere display and magnificence, <lb/>
            and not for daily use. The contriver of all which is again the <lb/>
            same vain opinion.</p>
          <p>Again : why need we seek for more in the way of ointment <lb/>
            than the juice pressed out of the fruit of the olive? For that <lb/>
            softens the limbs, and relieves the labour of the body, and <lb/>
            produces a good condition of the flesh; and if anything has <lb/>
            got relaxed or flabby, it binds it again, and makes it firm and <lb/>
            solid, and it fills us with vigour and strength of muscle, no <lb/>
            less than any other unguent. But the pleasant unguents of <lb/>
             <pb n="355"/>
            vain opinion, are set up in opposition to those that are merely <lb/>
            useful, on which the perfumers work, and to which vast <lb/>
            regions contribute, such as Syria, Babylon, the Indians, and <lb/>
            the Scythians; in which nations the origins of all perfumes <lb/>
            are found.</p>
          <p>IX. Again, with respect to drinking ; what more could man <lb/>
            really have need of than the cup of nature wrought with the <lb/>
            perfection of art ? Now such a cup our own hands supply, <lb/>
            which, if any one brings together and forms into a hollow, <lb/>
            applying them closely to his mouth, while another pours in the <lb/>
            liquid to be drank, he gets not only a remedy for his thirst, <lb/>
            but also a most indescribable pleasure. Still, if one were <lb/>
            absolutely in need of something else, would not the ivy cup of <lb/>
            the agricultural labourer be sufficient ? and why should it be <lb/>
            requisite to have recourse to the arts of other eminent artists ? <lb/>
            And what can be the use of providing a countless multitude of <lb/>
            gold and silver goblets, if it be not for the gratification of <lb/>
            boastful and vain-glorious arrogance, and of vain opinion <lb/>
            raising itself to an undue height ?</p>
          <p>Again, when men wear crowns, they are not content with <lb/>
            fragrant garlands of laurel, or ivy, or violets, or lilies, or <lb/>
            roses, or of any tree whatever, or of any flower, neglecting all <lb/>
            the gifts of God, which he bestows upon us at the various <lb/>
            seasons of the year, but they put golden crowns on their heads, <lb/>
            which are a very grievous weight, wearing them in the middle <lb/>
            of the crowded market-place without any shame. And what <lb/>
            can we think of such men, but that they are slaves of vain <lb/>
            opinion, in spite of their asserting themselves not only to be <lb/>
            free, but even to be rulers over many other persons ? The <lb/>
            day would fail me if I were to go through all the varieties of <lb/>
            human life ; and yet, why need I dwell on the subject with <lb/>
            prolixity ? For who is there who has not heard, or who has <lb/>
            not seen, such men as these ? Who is there who does not <lb/>
            associate with, and who is not familiar with them ? So that <lb/>
            the sacred scripture has very appropriately named addition " <lb/>
            the enemy of simplicity and the companion of pride ; for as <lb/>
            superfluous shoots do grow on trees, which are a great injury <lb/>
            to the genuine useful branches, and which the cultivators <lb/>
            destroy and cut out from a prudent foreknowledge of what is <lb/>
            necessary: so likewise the life of falsehood and arrogance <lb/>
            often grows up by the side of the true life devoid of pride, of <note type="footnote"> A A 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="356"/>
            which, to this day, no cultivator has been found who has been <lb/>
            able to cut away the injurious superfluous growth by the <lb/>
            rooos.</p>
          <p>Therefore the practisers of wisdom, knowing this in the first <lb/>
            instance by the outward sense, and secondly, pursuing it by <lb/>
            the mind, cry out loudly and say, " A. wicked beast has seized <lb/>
            and devoured Joseph."* But does not that most ferocious <lb/>
            beast, the various pride which springs up in the life of men <lb/>
            living in irregularity and confusion, whose chief workmen are <lb/>
            covetousness and unscrupulous cunning, devour every one <lb/>
            who comes within his reach ? Therefore grief will be added <lb/>
            to them, even while they are alive, as though they were dead, <lb/>
            since they have a life worthy of lamentation and mourning, <lb/>
            since Jacob mourns for Joseph, even while he is alive.</p>
          <p>But Moses will not allow the sacred reasonings about Na­ <lb/>
            dab to be bewailed ; t for they have not been carried off by a <lb/>
            savage beast, but have been taken up by unextinguishable <lb/>
            violence and imperishable light; because, having discarded all <lb/>
            fear and hesitation, they had duly consecrated the fervent and <lb/>
            fiery zeal, consuming the flesh, and very easily and vehe­ <lb/>
            mently excited towards piety, which is unconnected with <lb/>
            creation, but is akin to God, not going up to the altar by the <lb/>
            regular steps, for that was forbidden by law, but proceeding <lb/>
            rapidly onwards with a favourable gale, and being conducted <lb/>
            up even to the threshold of heaven, becoming dissolved into <lb/>
            ethereal beams like a whole burnt-offering.</p>
          <p>X. Therefore, 0 thou soul, that art obedient to thy teacher! <lb/>
            thou must cut off thine hand and thy power when it begins to <lb/>
            take hold of the parts of generation ; that is to say, of things <lb/>
            created, or of human pursuits; for very often ..... <lb/>
            ... to cut off the hand which has laid hold of the privy <lb/>
            parts,"‡ in the first place, because it has gladly received the <lb/>
            pleasure which it ought rather to hate ; and, secondly, because <lb/>
            it has thought that the faculty of propagating seed was in our <lb/>
            own power, and also, because it has attributed to the creature <lb/>
            the power which belongs to the Creator. Dost thou not see <lb/>
            that the earthly mass, Adam, when it lays its hand upon the <lb/>
            two trees, dies, because it has preferred the number two to the <lb/>
            unit, and because it has admired the creature in preference to <lb/>
            the Creator ? But do thou go forth beyond the reach of the <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xxxvii. 33. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Leviticus x. 6. </note> <note type="footnote"> ‡ Deut. xxv. 12. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="357"/>
            smoke and the tempest, and flee from the ridiculous pursuits <lb/>
            of mortal life as a fearful whirlpool, and do not, as the proverb <lb/>
            has it, touch them even with the tip of thy finger.</p>
          <p>And when thou hast girded thyself up for the sacred minis­ <lb/>
            trations, having made broad thy whole hand and thy whole <lb/>
            power, then take a firm hold of the speculations of instruction <lb/>
            and wisdom ; for the command is of this kind, " If a soul brings <lb/>
            a gift or a sacrifice, the gift shall be of fine wheaten flour."* <lb/>
            After that the lawgiver adds : " And when he has taken a <lb/>
            full handful of the fine wheaten flour, with the oil, and with all <lb/>
            the frankincense, he places the memorial on the altar of sacri­ <lb/>
            fice." Is not this a very beautiful and appropriate expression <lb/>
            of Moses, to call that soul incorporeal which is about to offer <lb/>
            sacrifice, but not to call the double mass which cousists of mor­ <lb/>
            tality and immortality by any such name ? For that which <lb/>
            vows the vow—that which is full of gratitude-that which <lb/>
            offers such sacrifices as are truly without spot, is one thing <lb/>
            only, namely, the soul.</p>
          <p>What then is the offering of the incorporeal soul ? What <lb/>
            is he fine wheaten flour, a symbol of the mind purified by the <lb/>
            suggestions of instruction, which is able, to render the friend <lb/>
            of education free from all disease, and life free from all <lb/>
            reproach? From which the priest taking a handful with his <lb/>
            whole hand, that is to say, with the whole grasp of his mind, <lb/>
            is commanded to offer up the whole soul itself, full of the <lb/>
            most unalloyed and pure doctrines, as the most excellent of <lb/>
            sacrifices, fat and in good condition, rejoicing in divine light, <lb/>
            and redolent of the exhalations which are given forth by <lb/>
            justice, and by the other virtues, so as always to enjoy a most <lb/>
            fragrant, and delicious, and happy life; for the oil and the <lb/>
            frankincense, of which the priest takes a handful with the <lb/>
            white wheat, contain a figurative assertion of this.</p>
          <p>XI. It is on this account that Moses set apart an especial <lb/>
            festival for the sheaf; however, not for every sheaf, but for <lb/>
            that which came from the sacred land. " For when," says he, <lb/>
            "you come into the land which I give unto you, and when <lb/>
            you reap its harvest, you shall bring sheaves as a first fruit of <lb/>
            your harvest to the priest. ”┼ And the meaning of this injunc­ <lb/>
            tion is, when, 0 mind, you come into the country of virtue, <note type="footnote"> * Leviticus it. 1. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Leviticus xxiii. 10. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="358"/>
            which it is fitting should be offered up to God alone, being a <lb/>
            land good for pasture, a land of rich soil, a land which beareth <lb/>
            fruit, and when you reap the fruit (either that afforded by <lb/>
            the land spontaneously or that which thou hast sown), which <lb/>
            has been brought to perfection by the God who gives perfec­ <lb/>
            tion ; carry it not home to thy house ; that is to say, do not <lb/>
            store it up, and do not attribute to thyself the cause of the <lb/>
            crop which has arisen to thee, before thou hast offered the first <lb/>
            fruits to the Cause of all wealth, and to him who persuaded <lb/>
            thee to study the operations which confer riches. And it is <lb/>
            enjoined that you shall offer the " first fruits of your own bar­ <lb/>
            vest ;" not of the harvest of the land, in order that we may <lb/>
            reap and gather in the harvest for ourselves; dedicating to <lb/>
            God all good and nutritious, and beneficial fruits.</p>
          <p>XII. But the man who is at the same time initiated in <lb/>
            dreams and also an interpreter of dreams, is bold to say that <lb/>
            his sheaf rose and stood upright; for in real truth, as spirited <lb/>
            horses lift their necks high, so all who are companions of vain <lb/>
            opinion place themselves above all things, above all cities, <lb/>
            and laws, and national customs, and above all the circum­ <lb/>
            stances which affect each individual of them. Then proceed­ <lb/>
            ing onwards from being demagogues to being leaders of the <lb/>
            people, and overthrowing the things which belong to their <lb/>
            neighbours, and setting up and establishing on a solid footing <lb/>
            what belongs to themselves, that is to say, all such dispositions <lb/>
            as are free and by nature impatient of slavery, they attempt <lb/>
            to reduce these also under their power ; on which account the <lb/>
            dreamer adds, " And your sheaves turning towards my sheaf <lb/>
            made obeisance unto it."*</p>
          <p>For the lover of modesty marvels at and fears the stiffnecked, <lb/>
            and the cautious person fears the self-willed man, and he who <lb/>
            reverences holiness fears that which is impious both for him­ <lb/>
            self and for others. And is not this reasonable ? For inas­ <lb/>
            much as the good man is a spectator, not only of human life <lb/>
            but also of all the things which exist in the world, he knows <lb/>
            how many things are accustomed to be caused by necessity, <lb/>
            and chance, and opportunity, and violence, and authority; and <lb/>
            what numbers of propositions, and what great instances of <lb/>
            prosperity proceeding onwards with rapidity towards heaven, <lb/>
            the same causes have shaken and overthrown; so that he will <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xxxvii. 7. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="359"/>
            of necessity take up caution as a shield, as a protection to <lb/>
            prevent his suffering any sudden and unexpected evil; for as <lb/>
            I imagine what a wall is to a city, that caution is to an indivi­ <lb/>
            dual.</p>
          <p>Do not these men then talk foolishly, are they not mad, who <lb/>
            desire to display their inexperience and freedom of speech to <lb/>
            kings and tyrants, at times daring to speak and to do things <lb/>
            in opposition to their will ? Do they not perceive that they <lb/>
            have not only put their necks under the yoke like brute beasts, <lb/>
            but that they have also surrendered and betrayed their whole <lb/>
            bodies and souls likewise, and their wives and their children, <lb/>
            and their parents, and all the rest of the numerous kindred <lb/>
            and community of their other relations ?</p>
          <p>And it is lawful for the charioteer, and also for the passenger, <lb/>
            with all freedom to spur, and to urge forward, and to check, and <lb/>
            to hold back, according as he desires to arrange things, so as to <lb/>
            make them greater or smaller. Therefore, being pricked with <lb/>
            goads, and flogged, and mutilated, and suffering all the cruel­ <lb/>
            ties which can be inflicted in an inhuman and pitiless manner <lb/>
            before death, all together, they are led away to execution and <lb/>
            put to death.</p>
          <p>XIII. These are the rewards of unseemly freedom of speech, <lb/>
            not of that which is accounted such by right-thinking judges, <lb/>
            but of that license which is full of folly, and insanity of mind, <lb/>
            and of incurable distemper. What do you mean ? Does any­ <lb/>
            one, when he sees a storm at its height, and a violent gale <lb/>
            opposing him, and a hurricane raging tempestuously, and the <lb/>
            sea full of vast waves, when he ought to anchor his ship, does <lb/>
            anyone, I say, at such a moment weigh anchor and put to sea ? <lb/>
            What pilot, or what captain of a ship, was ever so drunk and <lb/>
            intoxicated, as, while all the dangers which I have just enume­ <lb/>
            rated were threatening him, to be willing to set sail, lest, if his <lb/>
            vessel became water-logged by the sea breaking over it from <lb/>
            above, it might be swallowed up with all its crew ? For, if he <lb/>
            had been inclined to meet with a voyage free from danger, it <lb/>
            was in his power to wait for calm weather and a smooth and <lb/>
            favourable breeze. What would one say, suppose anyone were <lb/>
            to see a bear or a lion coming on with violence, and, while he <lb/>
            might pacify and tame him, were to provoke him and make <lb/>
            him savage, in order to give up himself as an unpitied meal <lb/>
            and feast to those ravenous monsters? Unless indeed anyone <lb/>
             <pb n="360"/>
            will assert that it is of no use to anyone to oppose the asps <lb/>
            and serpents of Egypt, and all the other things which ... <lb/>
            destructive poison ... inflict inevitable death on those <lb/>
            who are once bitten by them; for that men must be content <lb/>
            to use incantations, and so to tame those beasts, and by such <lb/>
            means to avoid suffering any evil from them.</p>
          <p>Moreover, are there not certain men who are more savage <lb/>
            and more treacherous than boars, or serpents, or asps ? whose <lb/>
            treacherous and malignant disposition it is impossible to escape <lb/>
            otherwise than by gentleness and caresses ? Therefore the wise <lb/>
            Abraham will offer adoration to the sons of Cheth, and their <lb/>
            name being interpreted, means " admiring," because the <lb/>
            occasion persuades him to do so. For he has not come to this <lb/>
            action of adoration because he honours persons who, by nature, <lb/>
            and by hereditary qualities, and by their own habits, are <lb/>
            enemies to reason, and who miserably waste that coinage of the <lb/>
            soul, namely instruction, corrupting, and adulterating, and <lb/>
            clipping it, but because he fears their present power and their <lb/>
            scarcely conquerable strength, and is on his guard not to <lb/>
            provoke them, he takes refuge in that great and powerful <lb/>
            possession and weapon of virtue, that most excellent place of <lb/>
            abode for wise souls, the double cave, which he could not <lb/>
            occupy while warring and fighting, but only by acting as a <lb/>
            champion and servant of reason.</p>
          <p>What ? Do not we also, when we are spending our time <lb/>
            in the market-place, frequently wonder at the masters, and <lb/>
            also at the beasts of burden? But we wonder at these two <lb/>
            classes, with different and not the same feelings. For we look <lb/>
            upon the masters with honour, and upon the beasts of burden <lb/>
            with fear, lest some injury should be done to us by them. And <lb/>
            when an opportunity offers, it is a good thing to attack our <lb/>
            enemies and put down their power; but when we have no such <lb/>
            opportunity, it is better to be quiet; but if we wish to find <lb/>
            perfect safety as far as they are concerned, it is advantageous <lb/>
            to caress them.</p>
          <p>XIV. On which account it is even now proper to praise <lb/>
            those persons who do not yield to the president of vain opinion <lb/>
            but who withstand him and say, " Shall you be a king and <lb/>
            rule over us?"* For they do not as yet see him actually in <lb/>
            possession of kingly power, they do not see him as yet kindled <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xxxvii. 8. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="361"/>
            like aflame, and shining and blazing in the unlimited fuel, but <lb/>
            only smouldering like a spark, dreaming of glory, and not <lb/>
            visibly having attained to it; for they also suggest favourable <lb/>
            hopes to themselves as if they will not be able to be overcome <lb/>
            by him; for which reason they say, " Shall you reign over us ?" <lb/>
            Which is equivalent to saying, Do you expect to be a king <lb/>
            over us while we are living, existing, strong, and breathing? <lb/>
            Perhaps, indeed, you may make yourself master of such as are <lb/>
            weak people, but with respect to us who are strong you will be <lb/>
            looked upon by us as a subject.</p>
          <p>And, indeed, this is the natural state of the case. For when <lb/>
            right reason is powerful in the soul, vain opinion is put down; <lb/>
            but when right reason is weak, vain opinion is strong. As <lb/>
            long, therefore, as the soul has its own power still safe, and as <lb/>
            long as it is not mutilated in any part of it, it may well have <lb/>
            confidence to attack and aim its arrows at the pride which <lb/>
            resists it, and it may indulge in freedom of speech, saying, <lb/>
            " You shall not be a'king, you shall not be a lord either over <lb/>
            us, or during our lifetime over others; but we, with our body- <lb/>
            guards and shield-bearers, the offspring of wisdom, will over­ <lb/>
            throw your attacks and baffle your threats with one single sally <lb/>
            of ours. In reference to which circumstances it is said, " They <lb/>
            began to hate him because of his dreams and because of his <lb/>
            words."</p>
          <p>But are not all the images which pride sets up and worships <lb/>
            mere words and dreams, while, on the contrary, those things <lb/>
            alone deserve to be called actions and real energies which are <lb/>
            referable to correct life and right reason ? And the one class <lb/>
            are worthy of hatred as being false, and the other class deserve <lb/>
            friendship as being full of desirable and lovely truth. Let no <lb/>
            one, therefore, venture to bring accusations against the virtues <lb/>
            of such men, as if they exhibited a specimen of an inhuman <lb/>
            and unbrotherly disposition ; but let any one who is disposed <lb/>
            to do so, learn that it is not a man who is now being judged <lb/>
            of, but the disposition which exists in the soul of each indivi­ <lb/>
            dual, which is mad on the subject of glory and arrogant pride; <lb/>
            let him embrace these men who have adopted irreconcileable <lb/>
            enmity and hatred towards this disposition, and let him never <lb/>
            love what is hated by them. Knowing thoroughly that such <lb/>
            judges are never deceived so as to wander from a sound opi­ <lb/>
            nion, but that, having leamt from the beginning to understand <lb/>
             <pb n="362"/>
            who is the true king, namely, the Lord, they indignantly refuse <lb/>
            to worship him who deprives God of his honour, and seeks to <lb/>
            appropriate it to himself, and who invites his fellow servants <lb/>
            to do him service.</p>
          <p>XV. On which account they say with confidence, " Shall you <lb/>
            be a king and reign over us ?" Are you ignorant that we are <lb/>
            not independent, but that we are under the government of an <lb/>
            immortal king, the only God? And why should you be a <lb/>
            lord and lord it over us ? for are we not under domination, and <lb/>
            have we not now, and shall we not have for ever, and ever the <lb/>
            same one Lord ? in being whose servants we rejoice more than <lb/>
            any one else can do in his liberty; for to be the servant of God <lb/>
            is the most excellent of all things which are honoured in crea­ <lb/>
            tion.</p>
          <p>I, therefore, should pray that I myself also might be able <lb/>
            to abide firmly in the things which have been decided by these <lb/>
            men; for they are accurate investigators, and superintendents, <lb/>
            and overseers of things, not of bodies, and just, and sober all <lb/>
            their lives, so as never to be deceived by any of those things <lb/>
            which are accustomed to deceive mankind. But up to this <lb/>
            time I am in a state of intoxication, and I am labouring under <lb/>
            much uncertainty, and I have need of a staff and of a guide <lb/>
            like a blind man; for if I had a staff to support me, then, <lb/>
            perhaps, I might neither stumble nor fall.</p>
          <p>But if any persons who are conscious that they are but <lb/>
            inconsiderate and precipitate, pay no attention to and do not <lb/>
            care to follow those who have investigated all necessary matters <lb/>
            with diligence and circumspection, nor, though they themselves <lb/>
            are ignorant of the road, submit to the guidance of those who <lb/>
            are acquainted with it, let them know that they have entered a <lb/>
            course which it is very difficult to travel through, and that <lb/>
            they are entangled in it, and will not be able to advance fur­ <lb/>
            ther ; but I am am so bound by treaties to these men, the <lb/>
            moment I have a little recovered from my intoxication, that I <lb/>
            think the same person both a friend and an enemy.</p>
          <p>But at present I will drive from me and hate that dreamer <lb/>
            no less than they do ; for no one in his senses could blame me <lb/>
            for this, that the majority of opinions and votes does always pre­ <lb/>
            vail ; but when he changes to a better course of life, and no <lb/>
            longer dreams, and no longer worries himself by entangling <lb/>
             <pb n="363"/>
            himself in the vain imaginations of the slaves of vain opinion, <lb/>
            and when he no longer dreams about night, and darkness, and <lb/>
            the changes of uncertain matters which cannot be guessed at; <lb/>
            he, then, having awakened from deep sleep, continues awake <lb/>
            and receives certainty instead of indistinctness, and truth <lb/>
            instead of false conceptions, and day instead of night, and light <lb/>
            instead of darkness, and rejects an Egyptian wife, that is to <lb/>
            say, the pleasure of the body, when she invites him to come <lb/>
            in to her, and to enjoy her conversation, out of an indescriba­ <lb/>
            ble love of continence and admiration for piety, and asserts his <lb/>
            right to a share in those kindred and inherited blessings from <lb/>
            which he appeared to be alienated, again desiring to recover <lb/>
            that portion of virtue which properly belongs to him.</p>
          <p>For proceeding by small and gradual improvements, as <lb/>
            if he were now established on the summit and perfection of <lb/>
            his own life, he cries out, what indeed he knows to a certainty <lb/>
            from what has happened to him, that he " belongs to God,"* <lb/>
            and that he belongs no more to any object of external sense <lb/>
            which can affect any creature; and then his brethren will <lb/>
            come to a permanent reconciliation with him, changing their <lb/>
            hatred into friendship, and their malignity into good will.</p>
          <p>But I who am the follower of these men, for I have learnt <lb/>
            to obey them as a servant obeys his master, will never cease <lb/>
            to praise him for his change of mind. Since Moses, also, that <lb/>
            priest of sacred things, preserves his change of mind as what <lb/>
            is worthy of love and of being preserved in -men's recollection, <lb/>
            from being forgotten, by the symbol of the bones* which he <lb/>
            did not think proper to have buried in Egypt for ever, looking <lb/>
            upon it as a hard thing, if the soul put forth any beautiful <lb/>
            flower to suffer that to wither away, and to be overwhelmed <lb/>
            and destroyed by the torrents which the Egyptian river of the <lb/>
            passions, namely the body, which is incessantly flowing through <lb/>
            all the outward senses, sends forth.</p>
          <p>XVI. The vision, therefore, which appeared proceeding <lb/>
            from the earth, with reference to the sheaves and the interpre­ <lb/>
            tation thereof, has now been sufficiently discussed. It is <lb/>
            time now to consider the other vision ; and to examine how <lb/>
            that is interpreted by the art of the explanation of dreams. <lb/>
            " He saw then," says the scripture, " a second dream, and he <lb/>
            related it to his father, and to his brethren, and he said, I saw <note type="footnote"> * Genesis 1. 19. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Exodus xiii. 19. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="364"/>
            that the sun, and the moon, and the eleven stars worshipped <lb/>
            me. And his father rebuked him, and said, What is this' <lb/>
            dream that thou hast dreamed ? Shall I, and thy mother, and <lb/>
            thy brethren, come forward and advance, and fall down to the <lb/>
            earth and worship thee ? And his brethren were jealous of <lb/>
            him ; but his father regarded his words.”*</p>
          <p>The studiers of sublime wisdom now say that the zodiac, <lb/>
            the greatest of all the circles in heaven, is studded with twelve <lb/>
            animals (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ζώδια</foreign>, from which it has derived its name. And that <lb/>
            the sun and the moon are always revolving around it, and go <lb/>
            through each of the animals, not indeed with equal rapidity, <lb/>
            but in unequal numbers and periods; the one doing so in <lb/>
            thirty days, and the other in as near as may be a twelfth part <lb/>
            of that time, that is in two days and a half; therefore, he who <lb/>
            saw this heaven-sent vision, thought that he was being <lb/>
            worshipped by eleven stars, ranking himself among them as the <lb/>
            twelfth, so as to complete the whole circle of the zodiac.</p>
          <p>And I recollect having before now heard some man who <lb/>
            had applied himself to learning in no careless or indolent <lb/>
            spirit, say that men were not the only beings which went mad <lb/>
            with vain opinions, but that the stars did so too. And they <lb/>
            also, said he, contend with one another for precedence, and <lb/>
            those which are the greater claim to be attended by the lesser <lb/>
            stars as their guards ; these matters, however, we may leave <lb/>
            for the studiers of sublime subjects to investigate, and to <lb/>
            settle how much truth and how much random assertion there <lb/>
            is in them.</p>
          <p>But we say, that the lover of indiscriminate study, and un­ <lb/>
            reasonable contention, and vain opinion, being always puffed <lb/>
            up by folly, wishes to assert a precedence, not only over men, <lb/>
            but also above the nature of all existing things; and he thinks <lb/>
            that all things were created for his sake, and that it is neces­ <lb/>
            sary that everything, whether earth or heaven, or water or air, <lb/>
            should bring him tribute; and he has gone to such an extra­ <lb/>
            vagant pitch of folly, that he is not able to reason upon such <lb/>
            matters as even a young child might understand, and to see <lb/>
            that no artist ever makes the whole for the sake of the part, <lb/>
            but rather makes the part for the sake of the whole. Now the <lb/>
            part of the whole is the man, so that he is properly asserted to <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xxxvii. 9. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="365"/>
            have been made for the sake of perfecting the world in which <lb/>
            he is rightly classed.</p>
          <p>XVII. But some persons are full of such exceeding folly, <lb/>
            that they are indignant if the whole world does not follow <lb/>
            their intentions: for this reason Xerxes, the king of Persia, <lb/>
            being desirous to strike terror into his enemies, made a dis­ <lb/>
            play of very mighty undertakings, altering the whole face of <lb/>
            'nature; for he changed the nature of the elements of the <lb/>
            earth and of the sea, giving land to the sea and sea to the <lb/>
            land, by joining the Hellespont with a bridge, and breaking <lb/>
            up Mount Athos into deep gulfs, which, being filled with sea, <lb/>
            became so many new and artificially-cut seas, being entirely <lb/>
            changed from the ancient course of nature. And having worked <lb/>
            wonders with respect to the earth, according to his wishes, he <lb/>
            mounted up upon daring conceptions, like a miserable man as <lb/>
            he was, contracting the guilt of impiety, and seeking to soar <lb/>
            up to heaven, as if he would move what cannot be moved, and <lb/>
            would subjugate the host of heaven, and, as the proverb has it, <lb/>
            he began with a sacred thing.</p>
          <p>For he aimed his arrows at the most excellent of the <lb/>
            heavenly bodies, the sun, the ruler of the day, as if he had <lb/>
            not himself been wounded by the invisible dart of insanity, <lb/>
            not only because of his desiring things which were impossible, <lb/>
            but such as were also most impious, either of which is a great <lb/>
            disgrace to him who attempts them.</p>
          <p>It is related, also, that the very populous nation of the <lb/>
            Germans, and theirs is a country where the sea is subject to <lb/>
            the ebb and flow of the tide, ran down to the reflux which <lb/>
            occurs in their country with great impetuosity, and drawing <lb/>
            their naked swords charged and encountered the billowy sea <lb/>
            as if it were a phalanx of enemies : and these men deserve to <lb/>
            be hated because they dare impiously to take up the arms of <lb/>
            enemies against the free and invincible parts of nature ; but <lb/>
            they deserve also to be ridiculed for attempting what is im­ <lb/>
            possible, as if they thought it practicable to wound the water <lb/>
            as though it were a living animal, or to stab it and kill it. <lb/>
            And again, one should grieve at the sight of such men, and <lb/>
            fear, and flee out of'fear at their attacks, and submit to all the <lb/>
            affections of the soul which are conversant with pleasures <lb/>
            and pains.</p>
          <p>XVIII. Moreover, it is only a very short time ago that <lb/>
             <pb n="366"/>
            I knew a man of very high rank, one who was prefect and <lb/>
            governor of Egypt, who, after he had taken it into his head to <lb/>
            change our national institutions and customs, and in an extra. <lb/>
            ordinary manner to abrogate that most holy law guarded <lb/>
            by such fearful penalties, which relates to the seventh day, <lb/>
            and was compelling us to obey him, and to do other things <lb/>
            contrary to our established custom, thinking that that would <lb/>
            be the beginning of our departure from the other laws, and of <lb/>
            our violation of all our national customs, if he were once able <lb/>
            to destroy our hereditary and customary observance of the <lb/>
            seventh day. And as he saw that those to whom he offered <lb/>
            violence did not yield to his injunctions, and that the rest of <lb/>
            our people was not disposed to submit in tranquillity, but was <lb/>
            indignant and furious at the business, and was mourning and <lb/>
            dispirited as if at the enslaving, and overthrow, and utter <lb/>
            destruction of their country; he thought fit to endeavour by <lb/>
            a speech to persuade them to transgress, saying: “ If an <lb/>
            invasion of enemies were to come upon you on a sudden, or <lb/>
            the violence of a deluge, from the river having broken down <lb/>
            all its barriers by an inundation, or any terrible fire, or a <lb/>
            thunderbolt, or famine, or pestilence, or an earthquake, or <lb/>
            any other evil, whether caused by men or inflicted by God, <lb/>
            would you still remain quiet and unmoved at home ? And <lb/>
            would you still go on in your habitual fashion, keeping your <lb/>
            right hand back, and holding the other under your garments <lb/>
            close to your sides, in order that you might not, even without <lb/>
            meaning it, do anything to contribute to your own preserva­ <lb/>
            tion? And would you still sit down in your synagogues, <lb/>
            collecting your ordinary assemblies, and reading your sacred <lb/>
            volumes in security, and explaining whatever is not quite <lb/>
            clear, and devoting all your time and leisure with long discus­ <lb/>
            sions to the philosophy of your ancestors ? Nay : rather <lb/>
            shaking off all these ideas, you would gird yourselves up for <lb/>
            the preservation of yourselves, and of your parents, and of <lb/>
            your children, and, if one must tell the plain truth, of your <lb/>
            possessions and treasures, to save them from being utterly <lb/>
            destroyed. And, indeed, I myself, am," said he, “ all the <lb/>
            evils which I have just enumerated : I am a whirlwind, I am <lb/>
            war, and deluge, and thunderbolt, and the calamity of famine, <lb/>
            and the misery of pestilence, and an earthquake which shakes <lb/>
            and overthrows what stood firm before, not being merely the <lb/>
             <pb n="367"/>
            name of a necessity of fate, but actual, visible power, standing <lb/>
            close to you."</p>
          <p>What then can we say that a man who says, or who merely <lb/>
            thinks such things as these, is ? Is he not an evil of an <lb/>
            extraordinary nature ? He surely must be some foreign <lb/>
            calamity, brought from over the sea, or from some other <lb/>
            world, since he, a man in every respect miserable, has dared <lb/>
            to compare himself to the all-blessed God. We must like­ <lb/>
            wise add, that he is daring here to utter blasphemies against <lb/>
            the sun, and the moon, and the rest of the stars, whenever <lb/>
            anything which had been looked for according to the seasons <lb/>
            of the year, either does not happen at all, or is brought about <lb/>
            with difficulty; if, for instance, the summer causes too much <lb/>
            heat, or the winter too excessive a cold, or if the spring or <lb/>
            autumn were unseasonable, so that the one were to become <lb/>
            barren and unfruitful, and the other to be prolific only in <lb/>
            diseases.</p>
          <p>Therefore, giving all imaginable license to an unbridled <lb/>
            mouth and abusive tongue, such a man will reproach the stars <lb/>
            as not bringing their customary tribute, all but claiming for <lb/>
            the things of earth the reverence and adoration of the heavenly <lb/>
            bodies, and for himself above them all, in proportion as he, <lb/>
            as being a man, looks upon himself as superior to the other <lb/>
            animals.</p>
          <p>XIX. Such men then are classed by us as the very teachers <lb/>
            of vain opinion. Let us now in turn look at their followers <lb/>
            by themselves. These men are always laying plots against <lb/>
            the practisers of virtue, and when they see them labouring to <lb/>
            make their own life pure with guileless truth, and to exhibit <lb/>
            it, as one may say, to the light of the moon, or of the sun, as <lb/>
            able to stand inspection, they endeavour by deceit, or even by <lb/>
            open violence, to hinder them, trying to drive them into the <lb/>
            sunless country of impious men, which is occupied by deep <lb/>
            night, and endless darkness, and ten thousand tribes of <lb/>
            images, and appearances, and dreams, and then, having thrust <lb/>
            them down thither, they compel them to fall down and <lb/>
            worship them as masters.</p>
          <p>For we look upon the practiser of virtue as the sun, since <lb/>
            the one gives light to our bodies, and the other to the things <lb/>
            which belong to the soul: and the education which such a <lb/>
            man uses we look upon as the moon, for the use of each is <lb/>
             <pb n="368"/>
            most pure and most useful in the night; and the brethren are <lb/>
            those virtuous reasonings which are the offspring of instrue­ <lb/>
            t ion, and of a soul devoted to the practice of virtue, all of <lb/>
            which make straight the right path of life, and which they, <lb/>
            therefore, by all kinds of wary and cunning wrestlings, seek to <lb/>
            overcome, and to trip up, and overthrow, and break the neck <lb/>
            of, because they have determined neither to think nor to say <lb/>
            anything sound themselves.</p>
          <p>For this reason his father rebukes this intractable youth <lb/>
            (I do not mean Jacob, but right reason, which is older even <lb/>
            than he), saying, 11 What is this dream which thou hast <lb/>
            dreamt ?" but thou hast not seen any dream at all; hast thou <lb/>
            fancied that things which are free by nature are to be of ne­ <lb/>
            cessity slaves to human things, and that things which are <lb/>
            rulers are to become subjects? and, what is more paradoxical <lb/>
            still, subject, not to anything else but to the very things which <lb/>
            they govern? and to be the slaves of no other things except <lb/>
            those very things which are their own slaves ? unless indeed <lb/>
            a change of all established things to their direct contraries is <lb/>
            to take place, by the power of God, who is able to effect all <lb/>
            things, and to move what is immovable, and to fix what is in <lb/>
            a constant state of agitation.</p>
          <p>Since on what principle can you be angry with or reproach <lb/>
            a man who sees a vision in his sleep ? For he will say, I did <lb/>
            not see it intentionally, why do you bring accusations against <lb/>
            me, for errors which I have not committed from any deliberate <lb/>
            purpose ? I have related to you what fell upon me and made <lb/>
            an impression on my mind suddenly, and without my desiring <lb/>
            it. But the present question is not about dreams, but about <lb/>
            things which resemble dreams; which, to those whose minds <lb/>
            are not highly purified appear great, and beautiful, and de­ <lb/>
            sirable things; while they are, in reality, trifling, and obscure, <lb/>
            and deserving of ridicule, in the eyes of honest judges of the <lb/>
            truth.</p>
          <p>XX. Shall I then, says he, I, that is to say, right reason, <lb/>
            come to you ? And shall the soul, which is both the mother <lb/>
            and nurse of the company devoted to learning virtuous in­ <lb/>
            struction, also come to thee ? And are the offspring of us too <lb/>
            to come likewise ? And are we all to stand in a row, laying <lb/>
            aside all our former dignity, and holding up our hands and <lb/>
            praying to thee ? And are we then to prostrate ourselves on <lb/>
             <pb n="369"/>
            the ground, and endeavour to propitiate and adore thee ? But <lb/>
            may the sun never shine upon such transactions, since deep <lb/>
            darkness is suited to evil deeds, and brilliant light to good <lb/>
            deeds.</p>
          <p>And what could be a greater evil than for pride, that <lb/>
            deceiver and beguiler, to be praised and admired, instead of <lb/>
            sincere and honest simplicity ? And it is with great propriety <lb/>
            that the statement is added, " And his father took notice or <lb/>
            his words." For it is the occupation of a soul which is not <lb/>
            young, nor barren, nor wholly unfruitful, but rather of one <lb/>
            which is really older and able to beget offspring, to cohabit <lb/>
            with prudent caution, and to despise and overlook nothing <lb/>
            whatever, but to have a reverential fear of the power of God, <lb/>
            from which we cannot escape, and which we cannot overcome; <lb/>
            and to look all round to see what its very end shall be.</p>
          <p>For this reason they say, that the sister of Moses also (and. <lb/>
            she is called Hope by us, when speaking in a figurative man­ <lb/>
            ner) was contemplated at a distance by the sacred scriptures, <lb/>
            inasmuch as she kept her eyes fixed on the end of life, hoping <lb/>
            that some good fortune might befall her, sent by the'Giver of all <lb/>
            good from above, from heaven; for it has often happened that <lb/>
            many persons, after having taken long voyages, and having <lb/>
            sailed over a great expanse of sea with a fair win'd, and with­ <lb/>
            out any danger, have suddenly been shipwrecked in the <lb/>
            harbour itself, when they have been on the very point of cast­ <lb/>
            ing anchor; and many persons too, who have successfully <lb/>
            come to the end of formidable wars of long duration, and <lb/>
            have come off unwounded so as never to have received even <lb/>
            a scratch on the surface of the skin, but to have escaped whole <lb/>
            and entire as if they had only been at some popular assembly <lb/>
            or national festival, having returned home with joy and cheer­ <lb/>
            fulness, have been plotted against in their houses by those <lb/>
            who, of all the world, least ought to have done so; being, as <lb/>
            the proverb says, like oxen slain in their stall.</p>
          <p>XXI. As these unexpected events, which no one could ever <lb/>
            have anticipated, do frequently happen in this manner and <lb/>
            overthrow people, so also do they often drive the powers of the <lb/>
            soul in a contrary direction to the proper one, and drag it in an <lb/>
            opposite way, according to their power, and compel it to change <lb/>
            its course: for what man, who has ever descended into the arena <lb/>
            of life, has come off without a fall ? And who is there who has <note type="footnote"> VOL. II. </note> <note type="footnote"> B B </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="370"/>
            never been tripped up in that contest ? He is happy who has <lb/>
            not often been so. And for whom has not fortune laid snares, <lb/>
            blowing upon him at intervals, and collecting its strength, that <lb/>
            it may twine itself around him, and speedily carry him off <lb/>
            before its adversary is ready for the contest ? Do we not know, <lb/>
            that some persons have come from infancy to old age who have <lb/>
            never been sensible of any irregularity, whether it be from the <lb/>
            happy condition of their nature, or from the care of those who <lb/>
            brought them up and educated them, or owing to both circum­ <lb/>
            stances ? But then, being filled with profound peace in them­ <lb/>
            selves, which is real peace, and the archetypal model of that <lb/>
            which exists in cities, and being considered happy on that <lb/>
            account, because they have never had a notion, not even in a <lb/>
            dream, of the intestine war which arises from the violence of <lb/>
            the passions, and which is the most piteous of all wars, have at <lb/>
            last, at the very close of their lives, run on shore and made <lb/>
            shipwreck, either through some intemperance of language or <lb/>
            some insatiable gluttony, or some incontinent licentiousness of <lb/>
            the parts below the belly. For some, while­ <lb/>
            " Still on the threshold of extreme old age," <lb/>
            Have admired the youthful, unhonoured, detestable, and dis­ <lb/>
            graceful life of debauchees; and others have given in to <lb/>
            the cunning, and wicked, and calumnious, and desperate way <lb/>
            of life of others, pursuing the first fruits of a quarrelsome <lb/>
            curiosity, when they ought rather to have discarded such habits <lb/>
            now, even if they had been familiar to them.</p>
          <p>For which reason one ought to propitiate God, and to suppli­ <lb/>
            cate him perseveringly, that he will not pass by our miserable <lb/>
            race, but that he will allow his saving mercy to be everlast­ <lb/>
            ingly shown towards us ; for it is difficult for those who have <lb/>
            tasted unalloyed peace to be prevented from glutting them­ <lb/>
            selves with it.</p>
          <p>XXII. But, come now, this hunger is a lighter evil than <lb/>
            thirst, inasmuch as it has love and desire for its comforters ; <lb/>
            but when, through the desire of drinking, it is necessary to <lb/>
            to satisfy one's self with that other fountain, the water of <lb/>
            which is dirty and unwholesome, then it is indispensable for <lb/>
            the drinkers, being filled with a bitter-sweet pleasure, to live <lb/>
            an unenv able life, betaking themselves to pernicious things <lb/>
            as though they were advantageous, from ignorance of what is <lb/>
             <pb n="371"/>
            really desirable. But the impetuous course of these evils is <lb/>
            most grievous when the irrational powers of the soul attack <lb/>
            the powers of the reason and get the better of them ; for as long <lb/>
            as the herds of oxen obey their drivers, and the flocks obey <lb/>
            their shepherds, and the goats obey the goatherds, the herds <lb/>
            and all belonging to them go on well; but when the herds­ <lb/>
            men who are appointed to look after the cattle become weaker <lb/>
            than the beasts committed to their care, then everything goes <lb/>
            wrong, and instead of regularity there arises irregularity, and <lb/>
            disorder in the place of order, and confusion instead of steadi­ <lb/>
            ness, and disturbance in the place of good arrangement, since <lb/>
            there is no longer any lawful superintending power properly <lb/>
            established; for if there had been such a thing, it would have <lb/>
            been destroyed before this time.</p>
          <p>What then ? Do we not think that even in ourselves there <lb/>
            is a herd of irrational cattle, inasmuch as the irrational multi­ <lb/>
            tude of the soul is deprived of reason, and that the shepherd <lb/>
            is the governing mind ? But as long as that is vigorous and <lb/>
            competent to act as the manager of the herd, everything goes <lb/>
            on in a just, and prosperous, and advantageous manner; but <lb/>
            when any weakness or want of power supervenes to the king, <lb/>
            then it follows of necessity that the subjects also labour with a <lb/>
            like infirmity; and when they most completely seem to be <lb/>
            in enjoyment of liberty, then they are a prize, lying most en­ <lb/>
            tirely ready for any one who pleases to contend for it to seize; <lb/>
            for the natural course is for anarchy to be treacherous, and for <lb/>
            government to be salutary, especially in a state where law and <lb/>
            justice are honoured. And this is such a state as is consistent <lb/>
            with reason.</p>
          <p>XXIII. We have now, then, spoken with sufficient accuracy <lb/>
            about the dreams of vain opinion. Now, the different species <lb/>
            of gluttony are conversant about drinking and eating. But the <lb/>
            one has no need of any great variety, while the other requires a <lb/>
            countless number of seasonings and sauces. These things, <lb/>
            then, are referred to two managers. The matters relating to <lb/>
            excessive drinking are referred to the chief butler, and those <lb/>
            which belong to luxurious eating to the chief baker. Now <lb/>
            these men are, with excessive propriety, recorded to have seen <lb/>
            visions of dreams in one night; for they, each of them, <lb/>
            labour to gratify the same need of their master, providing not <lb/>
            simple food, but such as is accompanied with pleasure and <note type="footnote"> B B 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="372"/>
            extraordinary gratification; and each of them, separately, <lb/>
            labours about half the food, but the two together are employed <lb/>
            about the whole, and the one part draws on the other; for <lb/>
            men when, they have eaten, immediately desire drink; and <lb/>
            men who have drunk immediately wish to eat; so that it is <lb/>
            in no slight degree on this account that a vision is ascribed to <lb/>
            them both at the same time. Therefore the chief butler has <lb/>
            the office of ministering to the appetite for wine, and the chief <lb/>
            baker to the voracity.</p>
          <p>And each of them sees in his vision what relates to his own <lb/>
            business: the one sees wine and the plant which engenders <lb/>
            wine, namely the vine; the other sees white bread lying on <lb/>
            dishes, and himself serving up the dishes.*</p>
          <p>Now perhaps it may be proper first of all to examine the first <lb/>
            dream. And it is as follows :—" In my sleep there was a vine <lb/>
            before me; and on the vine were three branches, and it <lb/>
            flourished and brought forth shoots, and there were on it ripe <lb/>
            bunches of grapes. And Pharaoh's cup was in my hand, and <lb/>
            I took the bunch of grapes and pressed it into the cup, and I <lb/>
            gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand.”† He speaks here in an <lb/>
            admirable manner, and the expression, " in my sleep," is quite <lb/>
            correct. For, in real truth, he who follows not so much the <lb/>
            inebriety which arises from wine as that which proceeds from <lb/>
            folly, being indignant at an upright and wakeful position, like <lb/>
            people asleep, is thrown down and relaxed, and shuts the eyes <lb/>
            of his soul, not being able either to see or to hear anything <lb/>
            which is worthy of being seen or of being heard. And being <lb/>
            overthrown, he goes on a blind and guideless (I will not say <lb/>
            path, but pathless) way through life, being pricked with thorns <lb/>
            and briars ; and sometimes too he falls down steep places, and <lb/>
            tumbles down upon other people, so as to hurt both them and <lb/>
            himself in a pitiable manner. But the deep and long-enduring <lb/>
            sleep in which every wicked man is held, removes all true con­ <lb/>
            ceptions, and fills the mind with all kinds of false images, and <lb/>
            unsubstantial visions, persuading it to embrace what is shameful <lb/>
            as praiseworthy. For at one time it dreams of grief as joy, and <lb/>
            does not perceive that it is looking at the vine, the plant of <lb/>
            folly and error. " For," says the chief butler, " the vine was <lb/>
            before me," the desired object was before him who desired it, <lb/>
            wickedness was before the wicked man: which we, foolish men <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xl. 16. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Genesis xl. 9. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="373"/>
            that we are, cultivate, without being aware that we are doing so <lb/>
            to our own injury, the fruit of which we eat and drink, classing <lb/>
            it under both species of food, which, as it would seem, we <lb/>
            appropriate, not for one half the evils that affect us for the <lb/>
            whole of our complete and entire misfortunes.</p>
          <p>XXIV. But it is desirable not to be ignorant that the intoxi­ <lb/>
            cation which proceeds from the vine does not affect all who <lb/>
            indulge in it in a similar manner, but very often affects different <lb/>
            people in contrary ways, so that it makes some better and others <lb/>
            worse than they are naturally. For in the case of some men, <lb/>
            it relaxes the sternness and moroseness of their character, and <lb/>
            relieves them of their cares, and assuages their anger and their <lb/>
            sorrow, and brings their dispositions into a milder mood, and <lb/>
            makes their souls placable. But of others again, it cherishes <lb/>
            the angry passions, and binds their pains firmly, and excites <lb/>
            their feelings of love, and stimulates their rudeness ; rendering <lb/>
            their mouth talkative, their tongue unbridled, emancipating <lb/>
            their external senses from all restraint, rendering their passions <lb/>
            furious, and their whole mind violent and excited towards every <lb/>
            object.</p>
          <p>So that the condition of the men first-mentioned appears to <lb/>
            resemble an untroubled calm in fine weather, or a waveless <lb/>
            tranquillity at sea, or a most peaceful and steady state of <lb/>
            affairs in a city. But the condition of those whom I have last <lb/>
            described, is more like a violent and unremitting gale, or a sea <lb/>
            tossed by a storm into vast billows, or a sedition, an evil more <lb/>
            fearful than even interminable and irreconcileable war.</p>
          <p>Therefore of these two banquet parties, the one is filled <lb/>
            with laughter, with men promising amusement, and hoping for <lb/>
            good fortune, and enjoying cheerfulness, and pleasant language, <lb/>
            and mirth, and joy, and freedom from anxiety; but the other is <lb/>
            full of melancholy, and seriousness, and downcast looks, and <lb/>
            offences, and reproaches, and wounds; of men gnashing their <lb/>
            teeth, looking fiercely at one another, barking, strangling one <lb/>
            another, contending with one another in every conceivable way, <lb/>
            mutilating one another's ears and noses, and whatever parts of <lb/>
            the body they can reach, displaying the intoxication of their <lb/>
            whole life and their drunkenness in this unholy contest, with <lb/>
            every kind of unseemly behaviour.</p>
          <p>XXV. It would therefore be naturally consistent to consider <lb/>
            next that the vine is the symbol of two things : of folly, and of <lb/>
             <pb n="374"/>
            mirth. And each of these two, though it is indicated by many <lb/>
            circumstances, we will explain in a few words, to avoid pro­ <lb/>
            lixity. When any one leading us along the road, deserted by <lb/>
            the passions and by acts of wickedness, the road, that is, of <lb/>
            philosophy, has led right reason to a height, and placed it like <lb/>
            a scout upon a watch-tower,* and has commanded it to look <lb/>
            around, and to survey the whole country of virtue, and to see <lb/>
            whether it be blessed with a deep soil, and rich, and productive <lb/>
            of herbage and of fruit, since deep soil is good to cause the <lb/>
            learning which has been sown in it to increase, and to make the <lb/>
            doctrines which have been planted in it, and which have grown <lb/>
            to trees, to form solid trunks, or whether it be of a contrary <lb/>
            character; and also to examine into actions, as one might <lb/>
            into cities, and see whether they are strongly fortified, or <lb/>
            whether they are defenceless and deprived of all the security <lb/>
            which might be afforded by walls around them.</p>
          <p>Also to inquire into the condition of the inhabitants, whether <lb/>
            they are considerable in numbers and in valour, or whether <lb/>
            their courage is weak and their numbers scanty, the two causes <lb/>
            acting reciprocally on one another. Then because we were <lb/>
            not able to bear the weight of the whole trunk of wisdom, we <lb/>
            cut off one branch and one bunch of grapes, and carried it with <lb/>
            us as a most undeniable proof of our joy, and a burden very <lb/>
            easy to be borne, wishing to display at the same time the <lb/>
            branch and the fruit of excellence to those who are gifted with <lb/>
            acuteness of mental sight, to show them, that is, the strongly- <lb/>
            shooting and grape-bearing vine.</p>
          <p>XXVI. They then very fairly compare this vine of which <lb/>
            we were only able to take a part, to happiness. And one of <lb/>
            the ancient prophets bears his testimony in favour of my view <lb/>
            of the matter, who speaking under divine inspiration has said, <lb/>
            " The vineyard of the Lord Almighty is the house of Israel."* <lb/>
            Now Israel is the mind inclined to the contemplation of God <lb/>
            and of the world ; for the name Israel is interpreted, " seeing <lb/>
            God," and the abode of the mind is the whole soul; and this <lb/>
            is the most sacred vineyard, bearing as its fruit the divine <lb/>
            shoot, virtue: thus thinking well (<foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸ εἆ ϕςοει̃ν</foreign>) is the deriva­ <lb/>
            tion of the word joy (<foreign xml:lang="grc">εὐϕςοσὑνη</foreign>), being a great and brilliant <lb/>
            thing so that, says Moses, even God himself does not disdain <lb/>
            to exhibit it; and most especially at that time when the <note type="footnote"> <unclear>c</unclear> Numbers xiii. ] 8. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Isaiah v. 7. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="375"/>
            human race is departing from its sins, and inclining and bend­ <lb/>
            in,, its steps towards justice, following of its own accord the <lb/>
            laws and institutions of nature.</p>
          <p>" For," says Moses, " the Lord thy God will return, that he <lb/>
            may rejoice in thee for thy good as he rejoiced in thy fathers, <lb/>
            if thou wilt hear his voice to keep all his commandments and <lb/>
            his ordinances and his judgments which are written in the <lb/>
            book of this law."* Who could implant in man a desire for <lb/>
            virtue and excellence, more strongly than is here done? Dost <lb/>
            thou wish, says the scripture, 0 mind, that God should rejoice? <lb/>
            Do thou rejoice in virtue thyself, and bring no costly offering, <lb/>
            (for what need has God of anything of thine ?) But, on the <lb/>
            other hand, receive with joy all the good things which be <lb/>
            bestows upon thee; for he rejoices in giving, when they who <lb/>
            receive are worthy of his grace; unless you think that those <lb/>
            men who live blameably may be justly said to make God <lb/>
            indignant and to excite his anger, but that those who live in a <lb/>
            praiseworthy manner do not make him rejoice.</p>
          <p>But there is nothing which gives so much pleasure to <lb/>
            fathers and mothers, our mortal parents, as the virtues of <lb/>
            their children,'even though they may be in want of numbers <lb/>
            of necessary things; And does not the excellence of these <lb/>
            aforesaid persons in like manner rejoice the Creator of the <lb/>
            universe, who is in no want of anything whatever ? Do thou <lb/>
            therefore, 0 mind, having learnt how mighty a thing the <lb/>
            anger of God is, and how great a good the joy of God is, do <lb/>
            not do anything worthy to excite his anger to thy own de­ <lb/>
            struction, but study only such things as may be the means 01 <lb/>
            your pleasing God. And you will find these actions to be not <lb/>
            the making of long and unusual journeys, nor the passing over <lb/>
            unnavigable seas, or wandering without stopping to take breath <lb/>
            to the furthest boundaries of earth and sea: for good actions <lb/>
            do not dwell at a distance and have not been banished beyond <lb/>
            the confines of the habitable world, but, as Moses says, good <lb/>
            is situated near you, and is planted along with you, being <lb/>
            united to you in three necessary parts, in the heart, in the <lb/>
            mouth, and in the hands: that is to say, in the mind, in the <lb/>
            speech, and in the actions ; since it is necessary to think and <lb/>
            to say, and to do good things, which are made perfect by a <lb/>
            union of good design, good execution, and good language. <note type="footnote"> * Deuteronomy xxx. 9. </note> <pb n="376"/>
            </p>
          <p>XXVII. I say therefore to him whose occupation is to <lb/>
            gratify one description of gluttony, the fondness for drinking, <lb/>
            namely to the chief butler, " Why are you labouring hard, 0 <lb/>
            unhappy man ? For you think that you are preparing plea­ <lb/>
            sant things to give delight, but in reality you are kindling a <lb/>
            flame of folly and intemperance, and contributing great and <lb/>
            abundant quantities of fuel to it." But perhaps he may reply, <lb/>
            do not blame me precipitately before you have considered my <lb/>
            case; I was appointed to pour out wine, not indeed for a man <lb/>
            who was endowed with temperance, and piety, and all the <lb/>
            other virtues, but for a violent, and intemperate, and unjust <lb/>
            master, one who was very proud in his impiety, and who <lb/>
            dared once to say, “ I do not know the Lord ;”* so that I very <lb/>
            naturally studied what would afford him gratification : and do <lb/>
            not wonder that God is delighted with one thing, and the <lb/>
            mind which is hostile to God, namely Pharaoh, with the <lb/>
            contrary.</p>
          <p>Who then is the chief butler of God? The priest who <lb/>
            offers libations to him, the truly great high priest, who, having <lb/>
            received a draught of everlasting graces, offers himself in <lb/>
            return, pouring in an entire libation full of unmixed wine.</p>
          <p>You see that there are differences between butlers in pro­ <lb/>
            portion to the differences existing between those whom they <lb/>
            are waiting on ; on this account I, the butler of Pharaoh, who <lb/>
            exerts his stiff-necked, and in all respects intemperate <lb/>
            reason, in the direction of indulgences of his passions, am a <lb/>
            eunuch, having had all the generative parts of my soul <lb/>
            removed, and being compelled to migrate from the apartments <lb/>
            of the men, and am a fugitive also from the women's chambers, <lb/>
            inasmuch as I am neither male nor female; nor am I able to <lb/>
            disseminate seed nor to receive it, being of an ambiguous <lb/>
            nature, neither one thing nor the other ; a mere false coin o. <lb/>
            human money, destitute of immortality, which is from time <lb/>
            to time kept alive by the constant succession of children and <lb/>
            offspring : being also excluded from the assembly and sacred <lb/>
            meeting of the people, for it is expressly forbidden that any <lb/>
            one who has suffered any injury or mutilation such as I have <lb/>
            should enter in thereto.!</p>
          <p>XXVIII. But the high priest of whom we are speaking is a <lb/>
            perfect man, the husband of a virgin (a most extraordinary <note type="footnote"> * Exodus v. 2. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Deuteronomy xxiii. 1. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="377"/>
            statement), who has never been made a woman ; but who on <lb/>
            the contrary, has ceased to be influenced by the customs of <lb/>
            women in regard to her connection with her husband.* And <lb/>
            not only is this man competent to sow the seeds of unpolluted <lb/>
            and virgin opinions, but he is also the father of sacred <lb/>
            reasonings, some of which are overseers and superintendents <lb/>
            of the affairs of nature, such as Eleazar and Itliamar; others <lb/>
            are ministers of the worship of God, earnestly occupied in <lb/>
            kindling and burning up the flame of heaven ; for, as they are <lb/>
            always uttering discourses relating to holiness, they cause it to <lb/>
            shine, bringing forth the most divine kind of piety like fire <lb/>
            from a flint; and the being who is at the same time the guide <lb/>
            and father of those men is no insignificant part of the sacred <lb/>
            assembly, but he is rather the person without whom the duly <lb/>
            convened assembly of the parts of the soul could never bo <lb/>
            collected together at all; he is the president, the chairman, the <lb/>
            creator of it, who, without the aid of any other being, is able <lb/>
            by himself alone to consider and to do everything.</p>
          <p>He, when taken in conjunction with others, is insignificant in <lb/>
            point of number, but when he is looked at by himself he be­ <lb/>
            comes numerous; he is a tribunal, an entire council, the whole <lb/>
            people, a complete multitude, the entire race of mankind, <lb/>
            or rather, if one is to speak the real truth, he is a sort of <lb/>
            nature bordering on God, inferior indeed to him, but superior <lb/>
            to man ; " for when," the scripture says, " the high priest goes <lb/>
            into the Holy of Holies he will not be a man."t What then <lb/>
            will he be if he is not a man? Will he be God? I would <lb/>
            not venture to say that (for the chief prophet, Moses, did <lb/>
            receive the inheritance of this name while he was still in <lb/>
            Egypt, being called "the god of Pharaoh ;”)‡ nor again is he <lb/>
            man, but he touches both these extremities as if he touched <lb/>
            both the feet and the head.</p>
          <p>XXIX. So now one kind of vine, which has been assigned <lb/>
            as the portion of cheerfulness, and the intoxication which <lb/>
            arises from it, namely unmingled goodness of counsel, and the <lb/>
            cup-bearer too who drew the wine from the divine goblet, <lb/>
            which God himself has filled with virtues up to the lip, has <lb/>
            been explained; but the other kind, that of folly, and grief, <lb/>
            and drunkenness, is also already depicted in a fashion but in <lb/>
            another character, by other expressions which are used in the <note type="footnote"> Genesis xviii. 11. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Leviticus xvi. 17. </note> <note type="footnote"> ‡ Exodus vu. 1. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="378"/>
            greater canticle ; " for," says the scripture, " their vine is of <lb/>
            the vine of Sodom and their tendrils are of the vine of Gomor­ <lb/>
            rah ; their grapes are the grapes of gall ; their bunches are full <lb/>
            of bitterness itself. Their wine is the madness of dragons and <lb/>
            the incurable fury of asps."*</p>
          <p>You see here what great effects are produced by the drunk­ <lb/>
            enness of folly: bitterness, an evil disposition, exceeding <lb/>
            gall, excessive anger, implacability, a biting and treacherous <lb/>
            disposition. The lawgiver most emphatically asserts the <lb/>
            branch of the vine of folly to be in Sodoin; and the name <lb/>
            Sodom, being Interpreted, means "blindness," or "barrenness;" <lb/>
            since folly is a thing which is blind, and also barren of all <lb/>
            good things ; though, nevertheless, some people have been so <lb/>
            greatly influenced by it as to measure, and weigh, and count <lb/>
            everything with reference to themselves alone.</p>
          <p>Gomorrah, being interpreted, means " measure ;” but Moses <lb/>
            conceived that God was the standard of weight, and measure, <lb/>
            and number, in the universe, but lie had not the same opinion <lb/>
            of the human mind. And he shows this in the following <lb/>
            passage, where he says, " There shall not be in thy sack one <lb/>
            weight, and another weight, a great and a small; there shall <lb/>
            not be in thy house one measure, and another measure, a great <lb/>
            and a small; thy weight shall be a true and just one." But <lb/>
            a true and just measure is, to conceive that'it is the only just <lb/>
            God alone who measures and weighs everything, and who has <lb/>
            circumscribed the nature of the universe with numbers, and <lb/>
            limitations, and boundaries. But it is unjust and false to ima­ <lb/>
            gine that these things are regulated in accordance with the <lb/>
            human mind. But the eunuch and chief butler of Pharaoh, <lb/>
            having beheld the plant generative of folly, namely, the vine, <lb/>
            adds besides to his delineation there stocks, that he may signify <lb/>
            the three extremities of error according to the three different <lb/>
            times ; for a root is equivalent to extremity.</p>
          <p>XXX. When, therefore, folly has overshadowed and occu­ <lb/>
            pied the whole soul, and when it has left no portion of it <lb/>
            unoccupied or free, it not only compels it to commit such <lb/>
            errors as are remediable, but such also as are irremediable. <lb/>
            Now those which admit of a remedy are set down as the <lb/>
            easiest and the first; but those which are irremediable are <lb/>
            altogether terrible, and are the last of all, being so far analo­ <note type="footnote"> * Deuteronomy xxxii. 32. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Deuteronomy xxv. 13. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="379"/>
            gous to roots. And as, in my notions, wisdom begins to benefit <lb/>
            a man in small matters, and ends at last in the absolute <lb/>
            perfection of all well-doing, so, in the same manner folly, con­ <lb/>
            straining the soul from above and leading it away from instruc­ <lb/>
            tion by small degrees, establishes it at last at a long distance <lb/>
            from right reason, and finally leads it to the extreme point, <lb/>
            and utterly overthrows it.</p>
          <p>And the dream showed that after the roots appeared the <lb/>
            vine flourished and put forth shoots and bore fruit; for, says <lb/>
            the chief butler, " It was flourishing and bearing shoots, <lb/>
            around which were bunches of grapes."* The foolish man is <lb/>
            accustomed to display barrenness, and never to put forth even <lb/>
            leaves, and, in fact, to be withered all his life ; for what could <lb/>
            be a greater evil than folly flourishing and bearing fruit ? But, <lb/>
            says he, " the cup of Pharaoh," the vessel which is the receptacle <lb/>
            of folly and drunkenness, and of the ceaseless intoxication of <lb/>
            life, “is in my band ;” an expression equivalent to saying, <lb/>
            depends upon my administration, and endeavours, and powers ; <lb/>
            for without my contrivances, the, passion will not proceed <lb/>
            rightly by its own efforts; for as it is proper that the reins <lb/>
            should be in the hands of the charioteer, and the rudder in <lb/>
            the hands of the pilot-for this is the only way in which the <lb/>
            course, of the chariot and the voyage of the vessel can pro­ <lb/>
            ceed successfully-so, also, the filling of the goblet with <lb/>
            wine is in the hands and depends upon the power of him who <lb/>
            by his art brings to perfection one of the two kinds of gluttony, <lb/>
            namely, satiety of wine.</p>
          <p>But why has he endured to boast in respect of a matter <lb/>
            which deserved rather to be denied than to be confessed? <lb/>
            Would it not have been better not to have confessed at all <lb/>
            that he was a teacher of intemperance, and not to admit that <lb/>
            he increased the excitement of the passions by wine in the <lb/>
            case of the intemperate man, as being an inventor and pro­ <lb/>
            ducer of a luxurious, and debauched, and most disgraceful way <lb/>
            of life. Such, however, is the case. Folly boasts of those <lb/>
            things which ought to be concealed ; and in this present case <lb/>
            it prides itself, not only on holding in its hands the receptacle <lb/>
            of the intemperate soul, that is to say, the cup of wine, and <lb/>
            in showing it to all men, but also in pressing out the grapes <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xL 10. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="380"/>
            into it; that is to say, in making that which satisfies the <lb/>
            passion, and bringing what is concealed to light.</p>
          <p>For as children which require food, when they are about to <lb/>
            receive the milk, squeeze and press out the breast of the <lb/>
            nurse that feeds them, so likewise does the workman and <lb/>
            cause of intemperance vigorously press the fountain from which <lb/>
            the evil of abundance of wine pours forth, that he may derive <lb/>
            food in a most agreeable manner from the drops which are <lb/>
            squeezed out.</p>
          <p>XXXI. Such a description then as I have here given may <lb/>
            be applied to the man who is made frantic by the influence of <lb/>
            unmixed wines, that lie is a drunken, and foolish, and irremedi­ <lb/>
            able evil. We must now, in turn, investigate the character of <lb/>
            the glutton, who is akin to the drunkard, and who is a sworn <lb/>
            companion of all kinds of voracity and greediness, labouring, <lb/>
            without any restraint, at the artificial gratification of his appe­ <lb/>
            tite. And yet it does not require a great deal of care to <lb/>
            arrive at his true character; for the dream which was seen is <lb/>
            a representation of his likeness very closely resembling him ; <lb/>
            and when we have accurately examined him, let us look upon <lb/>
            him as we would upon a representation in a mirror ; for " I <lb/>
            thought," said the chief cook, " that I had three baskets of <lb/>
            fine wheaten loaves upon my head." Now, using the word <lb/>
            " head " in an allegorical manner, we mean by it the dominant <lb/>
            part of the soul, that is, the mind, and we say that everything <lb/>
            rests or depends upon that; for he once exclaimed concerning <lb/>
            it, "All these things were in my charge." Therefore when <lb/>
            he had completed the preparation of these things which he had <lb/>
            devised against the miserable belly, he displayed himself also, <lb/>
            and, like a foolish man as he was, he was not ashamed to be <lb/>
            weighed down with so great a burden, namely, the weight of <lb/>
            three baskets ; that is to say, with three portions of time.</p>
          <p>For those who advocate the cause of pleasure affirm that it <lb/>
            consists of three times, of the memory of past delights, and of <lb/>
            the enjoyment of those that are present, and of the hope of <lb/>
            what are to come; so that the three baskets are likened unto <lb/>
            the three portions of time, and the cakes upon the baskets to <lb/>
            those circumstances which are suitable to each of the portions ; <lb/>
            to the recollection of past joys, to the enjoyment of present <lb/>
            pleasures, to the hope of future delights. And he who carries <lb/>
            all these things is likened unto the lover of pleasure, who has <lb/>
             <pb n="381"/>
            filled his faithless table, a table destitute of all hospitable and <lb/>
            friendly salt, not with one kind of luxury only, but with almost <lb/>
            every description and species of intemperance; and this is <lb/>
            enjoyed by king Pharaoh alone, as if he were sitting at a <lb/>
            public banquet, and devoting himself to a dispersion, and scat­ <lb/>
            tering, and defeat, and destruction of temperance ; for the <lb/>
            name Pharaoh, being interpreted, means " dispersion." And <lb/>
            it is a magnificent and royal piece of conduct in him not to <lb/>
            exult in the specious advantages of wisdom, but to pride him­ <lb/>
            self on those pursuits of profligacy which it is unseemly to <lb/>
            mention, wrecking himself on insatiable appetite, and gluttony, <lb/>
            and effeminacy of life.</p>
          <p>Therefore the birds, that is to say, the chances which never <lb/>
            could have been anticipated by conjecture, coming from outward <lb/>
            quarters and hovering around him, will attack and kindle <lb/>
            every thing like fire, and will destroy every thing with their <lb/>
            all-devouring power, so that there is not a single fragment <lb/>
            left to the bearer of the baskets for his enjoyment though he-. <lb/>
            had hoped to proceed with his inventions and contrivances, for <lb/>
            ever and ever carrying them on in a safe place, so that they <lb/>
            could never be taken from him.</p>
          <p>And thanks be to God who giveth the victory and who <lb/>
            renders the labours of the man who is a slave to his passions, <lb/>
            though ever so carefully carried out, still unproductive and <lb/>
            useless, sending down winged natures in an invisible manner <lb/>
            for their destruction and overthrow. Therefore, the mind, <lb/>
            being deprived of those things which it had made for itself, <lb/>
            having, as it were, its neck cut through, will be found head­ <lb/>
            less and lifeless, and like those who are fixed to a cross, nailed <lb/>
            as it were to the tree of hopeless and helpless ignorance. For <lb/>
            as long as none of these things come upon one which arrive <lb/>
            suddenly and unexpectedly, then those acts which are directed <lb/>
            to the enjoyment of pleasure appear to be successful; but <lb/>
            when such evils descend upon them unexpectedly, they are <lb/>
            overthrown, and their maker is destroyed with them.</p>
          <p>XXXII. The dreams, therefore, of those men who divide <lb/>
            those things which produce the taste according to every species <lb/>
            of food, whether it be meat or drink, and such as is not neces­ <lb/>
            sary but superfluous, and sought only by the intemperate, have <lb/>
            been sufficiently explained. But those of Pharaoh, who <lb/>
            appears to exercise sovereignty over these men and over all <lb/>
             <pb n="382"/>
            the powers of the soul, must now be investigated if we would <lb/>
            proceed in order and consistently with our plan.</p>
          <p>Pharaoh says, " In my dream I thought that I was standing <lb/>
            by the bank of a river, and seven oxen came up as it were out <lb/>
            of the river, of eminent plumpness in their flesh, and beautiful <lb/>
            to the view, and fed in the green marsh; and behold, seven <lb/>
            other oxen came up out of the river after them, evil to look at <lb/>
            and ill-favoured, and lean in their flesh, such that I never saw <lb/>
            any leaner in all Egypt; and the lean and ill-favoured oxen <lb/>
            devoured the seven former oxen which were beautiful, and <lb/>
            picked out, and they entered into their stomachs, and still <lb/>
            their appearance remained ill-favoured, as I have described it <lb/>
            at first. And when I had awoke 1 fell asleep again ; and again <lb/>
            I saw in my dream, and as it were seven ears of corn grew up <lb/>
            on one stalk, full and beautiful. And seven other ears of <lb/>
            corn also came up, lean and wind-beaten, close to them, and <lb/>
            these last seven ears did swallow up the seven beautiful and <lb/>
            full ears.”*</p>
          <p>You see now the preface of the lover of self who being easily <lb/>
            moved, and changeable, and fickle, both in his body and soul, <lb/>
            says, " I thought that I was standing," and did not consider <lb/>
            that unchangeableness and steadiness belong to God alone, and <lb/>
            to him who is dear to God. And the most evident proof of <lb/>
            the unchangeable power which exists in him is this world, <lb/>
            which is always in the same place and in the same condition. <lb/>
            And if the world is immovable how can the Creator of it be <lb/>
            any thing but firm ?</p>
          <p>In the second place the sacred scriptures are likewise most <lb/>
            infallible witnesses; for it is said in them, where the words <lb/>
            are put into the mouth of God, " I stand here and there, <lb/>
            before you were dwelling upon the rock,"t which is an expres­ <lb/>
            sion equivalent to, Thus am I who am visible to you, and am <lb/>
            here : and I am there and everywhere, filling all places, stand­ <lb/>
            ing and abiding in the same condition, being unchangeable, <lb/>
            before you or any one of the objects of creation had any exist­ <lb/>
            ence, being beheld upon the highest and most ancient authority <lb/>
            of power, from which the creation of all existing things was <lb/>
            shed forth, and the stream of wisdom flowed; " for I am he <lb/>
            who brought the stream of water out of the solid rock,”‡ is said <lb/>
            in another place. And Moses also bears witness to the immu­ <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xli. 17. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Exodus xvii. G. </note> <note type="footnote"> ‡ Deut. viii. 15. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="383"/>
            tability of the Deity, where he says, " I saw the place where <lb/>
            the God of Israel stood ; ”* intimating enigmatically that he is <lb/>
            not given to change by speaking here of his standing, and of <lb/>
            his being firmly established.</p>
          <p>XXXIII. But there is in the Deity such an excessive <lb/>
            degree of stability and firmness, that he gave even to the most <lb/>
            excellent natures a share of his durability as his most excel­ <lb/>
            lent possession : and presently afterwards he, the most ancient <lb/>
            author of all things, namely God, says that he is about to erect <lb/>
            firmly his covenant full of grace (and that means his law and <lb/>
            his word) in the soul of the just man as on a solid foundation, <lb/>
            which shall be an image in the likeness of God, when he says <lb/>
            to Noah, " I will establish my covenant with thee."t And <lb/>
            besides this, he also indicates two other things, one that <lb/>
            justice is in no respect different from the covenant of God, <lb/>
            the other that other beings bestow gifts which are different <lb/>
            from the persons who receive them; but God gives not only <lb/>
            those gifts, but he gives also the very persons who receive <lb/>
            them to themselves, for he has given me to myself, and every <lb/>
            living being has he given to himself; for the expression, " 1 <lb/>
            will establish my covenant with thee," is equivalent to, I will <lb/>
            give thee to thyself.</p>
          <p>And all those who are truly lovers of God desire eagerly to <lb/>
            escape from the storm of multiplied affairs and business in <lb/>
            which there is always tempestuous weather, and rough sea, <lb/>
            and confusion, and to anchor in the calm and safe untroubled <lb/>
            haven of virtue. Do you not see what is said about the wise <lb/>
            Abraham who " is standing before the Lord ?”‡ For when <lb/>
            was it likely that the mind would be able to stand, no longer <lb/>
            inclining to different sides like the balance in a scale, except <lb/>
            when it is opposite to God, beholding him and being beheld <lb/>
            by him ? For perfect absence of motion comes to it in two <lb/>
            ways, either from beholding him with whom nothing can be <lb/>
            compared, because he is not attracted by anything resembling <lb/>
            himself, or from being beheld by him, because <lb/>
            which he considered worthy, the ruler has assigned to himself <lb/>
            alone as the most excellent of beings. And indeed a divine <lb/>
            admonition was given in the following terms to Moses: <lb/>
            " Stand thou here with me,”§ by which injunction both these <note type="footnote"> * Exodus xxiv. 10. </note><note type="footnote"> ‡ Genesis mviii. 22. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Genesis ix. 10. </note><note type="footnote"> § Deuteronomy v. 31. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="384"/>
            things appear to be intimated, first, the fact that the good man <lb/>
            is not moved, and secondly, the universal stability of the living <lb/>
            God.</p>
          <p>XXXIV. For, in real truth, whatever is akin or near to <lb/>
            God is appropriated by him, becoming steady and stationary <lb/>
            by reasou of his uncliangeableness ; and the mind, being at <lb/>
            rest, well knows how great a blessing rest is, and admiring, its <lb/>
            own beauty, it conceives that either it is assigned to God aloue <lb/>
            as his, or else to that intermediate nature which is between <lb/>
            the mortal and the immortal race ; at all events, it says, " And <lb/>
            I stood in the midst between the Lord and you,"* not meaning <lb/>
            by these words that he was standing on his own feet, but <lb/>
            wishing to indicate that the mind of the wise man, being <lb/>
            delivered from all storms and wars, and enjoying unruffled <lb/>
            calm and profound peace, is superior indeed to man, but <lb/>
            inferior to God.</p>
          <p>For the ordinary human mind is influenced by opinion, and <lb/>
            is thrown into confusion by any passing circumstances ; but <lb/>
            the other is blessed and happy, and free from all participation <lb/>
            in evil. And the good man is on the borders, so that one may <lb/>
            appropriately say that he is neither God nor man, but that he <lb/>
            touches the extremities of both, being connected with the <lb/>
            mortal race by his manhood, and with the immortal race by <lb/>
            his virtue.</p>
          <p>And there is something which closely resembles this in the <lb/>
            passage of scripture concerning the high priest; “ For when, <lb/>
            says the scripture, " he goes into the holy of holies, he will <lb/>
            not be a man till he has gone out again.”† But if at that <lb/>
            time he is not a man, it is clear that he is not God either, but <lb/>
            a minister of God, belonging as to his mortal nature to <lb/>
            creation, but as to his immortal nature to the uncreate God. <lb/>
            And he is placed in the middle class until he again goes forth <lb/>
            among the things which belong to the body and to the flesh.</p>
          <p>And this is the order of things according to nature, when <lb/>
            the mind, being entirely occupied with divine love, bends its <lb/>
            course towards the temple of God, and approaches it with all <lb/>
            possible earnestness and zeal, it becomes inspired, and forgets <lb/>
            all other things, and forgets itself also. It remembers him <lb/>
            alone, and depends on him alone, who is attended by it as by <lb/>
            a body-guard, and who receives its ministrations, to whom it <note type="footnote"> * Deuteronomy x. 10. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Leviticus xvi. 17. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="385"/>
            consecrates and offers up the sacred and untainted virtues. <lb/>
            But when the inspiration has ceased, and the excessive desire <lb/>
            has relaxed, then it returns from divine things and becomes a <lb/>
            man again, mixing with human affairs, which were awaiting <lb/>
            him in the vestibule, that they might carry him off while <lb/>
            gazing only on the things in them.</p>
          <p>XXXV. Moses therefore describes the perfect man as being <lb/>
            neither God nor man, but, as I said before, something on the <lb/>
            border between the uncreated and the perishable nature. <lb/>
            Again, he classes him who is improving and advancing towards <lb/>
            perfection in the region between the dead and the living, <lb/>
            meaning by " the living" those persons who dwell with wis­ <lb/>
            dom, and by " the dead" those who rejoice in folly; for it is <lb/>
            said with respect to Aaron, that " He stood between the dead <lb/>
            and the living, and the plague was stayed."* For he who is <lb/>
            making progress is not reckoned among those who are dead <lb/>
            as to the life of virtue, inasmuch as he has a desire and <lb/>
            admiration of what is honourable, nor among those who are <lb/>
            living in extreme and perfect prosperity, for there is still <lb/>
            something wanting to the end, but he touches both extremes ; <lb/>
            on which account the expression, “ the plague was stayed," is <lb/>
            very properly used rather than “ the plague ceased ;” for in <lb/>
            those who are perfect the things which break, and crush, and <lb/>
            destroy the soul cease ; but in those who are advancing towards <lb/>
            perfection, they are only diminished, as if they were only cut <lb/>
            short and checked.</p>
          <p>XXXVI. Since then all steadiness, and stability, and the <lb/>
            abiding for ever in the same place unchangeably and im­ <lb/>
            movably, is first of all seen in the living God, and next in the <lb/>
            word of the living God, which he has called his covenant; <lb/>
            and in the third place in the wise man, and in the fourth <lb/>
            degree in him who is advancing towards perfection, what could <lb/>
            induce the wicked mind, which is liable to all sorts of curses, <lb/>
            to think that it is able to stand by itself, while it is in reality <lb/>
            borne about as in a deluge, and dragged hither and thither by <lb/>
            the incessant eddies of things flowing in through the dead and <lb/>
            agitated body ? " For I thought," says the scripture, " that <lb/>
            I was standing on the bank of the river :"t and by the word <lb/>
            river we say that speech is symbolically meant, since both these <lb/>
            things are borne outward, and flow on with a vigorous and <note type="footnote"> * Numbers xvi. 48. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Genesis xli. 17. </note> <note type="footnote"> VOL. II. </note> <note type="footnote"> c c </note> <lb/>

            sustained speed. And the one is at one time filled up with a <lb/>
            great abundance of water, and the other with a quantity of <lb/>
            verbs and nouns, and at another time they are both empty and <lb/>
            relaxed, and in a state of quiescence ; again, they are of use <lb/>
            inasmuch as the one irrigates the fields, and the other fertilizes <lb/>
            the souls of those who receive it. And at times they are in­ <lb/>
            , jurious by reason of overflowing, as then the one deluges the <lb/>
            land on its borders, and the other troubles and confuses the <lb/>
            reason of those who do not attend to it.</p>
          <p>XXXVII. Therefore speech is compared to a river, and the <lb/>
            nature of speech is twofold, the one sort being better and the <lb/>
            other worse; that is, the better kind which does good, and <lb/>
            that of necessity is the worse kind which does harm; and <lb/>
            Moses has given most conspicuous examples of each kind to <lb/>
            those who are able to see, for he says, " For a river goes out <lb/>
            of Eden to water the Paradise, and from thence it is divided <lb/>
            into four branches and by the name Eden he means the <lb/>
            wisdom of the living God, and the interpretation of the name <lb/>
            Eden is " delight," because I imagine wisdom is the delight of <lb/>
            God, and God is the delight of wisdom, as it is said also in <lb/>
            the Psalms, " Delight thou in the Lord."t</p>
          <p>And the divine word, like a river, flows forth from wisdom <lb/>
            as from a spring, in order to irrigate and fertilize the celestial <lb/>
            and heavenly shoots and plants of such souls as love virtue, as <lb/>
            if they were a paradise. And this sacred word is divided into <lb/>
            four beginnings, by which I mean it is portioned out into four <lb/>
            virtues, each of which is a princess, for to be divided into be­ <lb/>
            ginnings,‡ does not resemble divisions of place, but a kingdom, <lb/>
            in order that any one, after having shown the virtues as boun­ <lb/>
            daries, may immediately proceed to show the wise man who <lb/>
            follows them to be a king, being elected as such, not by men, <lb/>
            but by the only free nature which cannot err, and which can­ <lb/>
            not be corrupted; for those who behold the excellence of <lb/>
            Abraham say unto him, " Thou art a king, sent from God <lb/>
            among us :"§ proposing as a maxim, for those who study philo­ <lb/>
            sophy, that the wise man alone is a ruler and a king, and that <lb/>
            virtue is the only irresponsible authority and sovereignty. <note type="footnote"> * Genesis ii. 10. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Psalm xxxvi. 4. </note> <note type="footnote"> ‡ There is an unavoidable obscurity in the translation here. The <lb/>
            Greek word is <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀρχαὶ</foreign>, which means beginnings, or principles, and also <lb/>
            governments. § Genesis xxiii. 6. </note> <pb n="387"/>
            </p>
          <p>XXXVIII. Accordingly, one of the followers of Moses, <lb/>
            having compared this speech to a river, has said in the Psalms, <lb/>
            " The river of God was filled with water;"* and it is absurd <lb/>
            to give such a title to any of the rivers which flow upon the <lb/>
            earth. But as it seems the psalmist is here speaking of the <lb/>
            divine word, which is full of the streams of wisdom, and which <lb/>
            has no part of itself empty or desolate, or rather, as some one <lb/>
            has said, which is diffused everywhere over the universe, and <lb/>
            is raised up on high, on account of the continued and incessant <lb/>
            rapidity of that ever-flowing spring.</p>
          <p>There is also another expression in the Psalms, such as <lb/>
            this, " The course of the river makes glad the city of God. ”† <lb/>
            What city? For the holy city, which exists at present, in <lb/>
            which also the holy temple is established, at a great distance <lb/>
            from any sea or river, so that it is clear, that the writer here <lb/>
            means, figuratively, to speak of some other city than the <lb/>
            visible city of God. For, in good truth, the continual stream <lb/>
            of the divine word, being borne on incessantly with rapidity <lb/>
            and regularity, is diffused universally over everything, giving <lb/>
            joy to all. And in one sense he calls the world the city of <lb/>
            God, as having received the whole cup of the divine draught, <lb/>
            and being gladdened thereby, so as to have <lb/>
            derived from it an imperishable joy, of which it cannot be <lb/>
            deprived for ever.</p>
          <p>But in another sense he applies this title to the soul of the <lb/>
            wise man, in which God is said also to walk, as if in a city, <lb/>
            " For," says God, " I will walk in you, and I will be your God <lb/>
            in you.”‡ And who can pour over the happy soul which prof­ <lb/>
            fers its own reason as the most sacred cup, the holy goblets of <lb/>
            true joy, except the cup-bearer of God, the master of the feast, <lb/>
            the word? not differing from the draught itself, but being <lb/>
            itself in an unmixed state, the pure delight and sweetness, and <lb/>
            pouring forth, and joy, and ambrosial medicine of pleasure <lb/>
            and happiness; if we too may, for a moment, employ the lan­ <lb/>
            guage of the poets.</p>
          <p>XXXIX. But that which is called by the Hebrews the <lb/>
            city of God is Jerusalem, which name being interpreted means, <lb/>
            " the sight of peace." So that do not look for the city of the <lb/>
            living God in the regions of the earth, for it is not made of <lb/>
            wood or of stone, but seek it in the soul which is free from <note type="footnote"> * Psalm lxv. 10. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Psalm xlv. 5. </note> <note type="footnote"> ‡ Leviticus xxvi. 12. </note> <note type="footnote"> C C 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="388"/>
            war, and which proposes to those who are endowed with acute­ <lb/>
            ness of sight a contemplative and peaceful life: since where <lb/>
            could any find a more venerable and holy abode for God amid <lb/>
            all existing things, than the mind fond of contemplation, which <lb/>
            is eager to behold every thing and which does not, even in a <lb/>
            dream, feel a wish for sedition or disturbance ? And again, <lb/>
            the invisible spirit which is accustomed to converse with me <lb/>
            in an unseen manner prompts me with a suggestion, and says, 0 <lb/>
            my friend, you seem to be ignorant of an important and most <lb/>
            desirable matter which I will explain to you completely; for I <lb/>
            have also in a most seasonable manner explained many other <lb/>
            things to you also. Know, then, 0 excellent man, that God <lb/>
            alone is the truest, and most real, and genuine peace, and that <lb/>
            every created and perishable essence is continual war.</p>
          <p>For God is something voluntary, and mortal essence is <lb/>
            necessity. Whoever, therefore, is able to forsake war, and <lb/>
            necessity, and creation, and destruction, and to pass over to <lb/>
            the uncreated being, to the immortal God, to the voluntary <lb/>
            principle, and to peace, may justly be called the abode and <lb/>
            city of God. Do not, therefore, consider it a different thing <lb/>
            whether you speak of the sight of peace or the sight of God, <lb/>
            as they are the same thing; because peace is not only the <lb/>
            companion but also the chief of the powers of the living God, <lb/>
            which are distinguished by many names.</p>
          <p>XL. And, moreover, he says to the wise Abraham, “ that <lb/>
            he will give him an inheritance of land from the river of <lb/>
            Egypt to the great river, the river Euphrates,"* not mean­ <lb/>
            ing a portion of the land so much as a better portion in respect <lb/>
            of our own selves. For our own body, and the passions which <lb/>
            exist in it, and which are engendered by it, are likened to the <lb/>
            river of Egypt, but the soul and the passions which are dear to <lb/>
            that are likened to the river Euphrates. And here a doctrine <lb/>
            is laid down, at once most profitable to life and of the highest <lb/>
            importance, that the good man has received for his inheritance <lb/>
            the soul and the virtues of the soul: just as, on the contrary, <lb/>
            the wicked man has received for his share the body and the <lb/>
            vices of the body, and those which are engendered by the <lb/>
            body.</p>
          <p>And the expression " from," has a double sense. One, that <lb/>
            by which the starting point from which it begins is included ; <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xv. 18. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="389"/>
            the other that by which it is excluded. For when we say <lb/>
            that from morning to evening there are twelve hours, or from <lb/>
            the new moon to the end of the month there are thirty days, <lb/>
            we are including in our enumeration both the first hour and <lb/>
            the day of the new moon. And when any one says that such <lb/>
            and such a field is three or four furlongs distant from the city, <lb/>
            he clearly means to leave the city itself out of that measure­ <lb/>
            ment. So that now, too, we must consider that the expres­ <lb/>
            sion, "from the river of Egypt," is to be understood so as not <lb/>
            to include that river; for the writer intends to remove us to a <lb/>
            distance from the things of the body which are seen to exist <lb/>
            in a constant flow and course which is being destroyed and <lb/>
            destroying, that so we may receive the inheritance of the <lb/>
            soul with the imperishable virtues, which are, moreover, deserv­ <lb/>
            in- of immortality.</p>
          <p>Thus, therefore, by tracing it out diligently, we have found <lb/>
            that praiseworthy speech is likened to a river; but speech which <lb/>
            is deserving of blame is the very river of Egypt itself, untracta­ <lb/>
            ble, unwilling to learn, as one may say In a word, lifeless <lb/>
            speech; for which reason it is also changed into blood,* as not <lb/>
            being able to afford sustenance. For the speech of ignorance <lb/>
            is not wholesome, and it is productive of bloodless and lifeless <lb/>
            frogs, which utter only a novel and harsh sound, a noise pain­ <lb/>
            ful to the ear. And it is said, likewise, that all the fish in <lb/>
            that river were destroyed. And by the fish are here figura­ <lb/>
            tively meant the conceptions; for these things float about and <lb/>
            exist in speech as in a river, resembling living things and fill­ <lb/>
            ing the river with life. But in uninstructed speech all coil­ <lb/>
            ceptions die; for it is not possible to find any thing intelligent <lb/>
            in it, but only, as some one has said, some disorderly and <lb/>
            unmusical voices of jackdaws.</p>
          <p>XLI. We have now then said enough on these subjects. But <lb/>
            since he not only confesses that he saw in his dream, a stand­ <lb/>
            ing and a river, but also the banks of a river, as his words are, <lb/>
            “ I thought that I was standing by the bank (<foreign xml:lang="grc">χειλος</foreign>) of the <lb/>
            river."t It must be desirable to say a few seasonable things also <lb/>
            about the bank. Now there appears to be two most necessary <lb/>
            objects on account of which nature has adapted lips (<foreign xml:lang="grc">χειλη</foreign>) to <lb/>
            all animals, and especially to men; one for the sake of tran­ <lb/>
            quillity, for they are the strongest bulwark and fortification of <note type="footnote"> * Exodus vii. 17. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Genesis xli. 17. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="390"/>
            the voice; the other for the sake of distinctness, for it is <lb/>
            through them that the stream of words issues forth. For when <lb/>
            they are closed speech is checked; for it is impossible that it <lb/>
            should be borne outward if they are not parted. And by these <lb/>
            means nature prepares and trains man for both objects, speech <lb/>
            and silence, watching the appropriate time for each employ­ <lb/>
            ment.</p>
          <p>As for instance, is anything said worth listening to ? Then <lb/>
            attend, raising no obstacle, in perfect quiet, according to the <lb/>
            injunction of Moses, “ Be silent and hear."* For of those per <lb/>
            sons who mix themselves up in contentions discussions there <lb/>
            is not one who can properly be considered as either speaking <lb/>
            or listening; but this is only advantageous to him who is <lb/>
            about to do so.</p>
          <p>Again, when you see, amid the wars and disasters of life, <lb/>
            the merciful hand of God and his favourable power held over <lb/>
            you and standing in defence of you, be silent yourself; for that <lb/>
            champion stands in no need of any assistance. And there are <lb/>
            proofs of this fact recorded In the sacred writings; such, for <lb/>
            instance, as the verse, “ The Lord will fight for us, and ye shall <lb/>
            be silent. ”† And if you see the genuine offspring and the first­ <lb/>
            born of Egypt destroyed, namely desire, and pleasures, and <lb/>
            pain, and fear, and iniquity, and mirth, and intemperance, and <lb/>
            all the other qualities which are similar and akin to these, <lb/>
            then marvel and be silent, dreading the terrible power of God ; <lb/>
            for, say the scriptures, " Not a dog shall move his tongue, nor <lb/>
            shall anything, man or beast, utter a sound ;”‡ which is equi­ <lb/>
            valent to saying, It does not become either the impudent <lb/>
            tongue to bark and curse-nor the man that is within us, that <lb/>
            is to say, our dominant mind ; nor the cattle-like beast which <lb/>
            is within us, that is to say, the outward sense-to boast, when <lb/>
            all the evil that was in us has been utterly destroyed, and <lb/>
            when an ally from without comes of his own accord to hold his <lb/>
            shield over us.</p>
          <p>XLII. But there are many occasions which are not well <lb/>
            suited to silence : and if we go to the language of ordinary <lb/>
            prose, of which we may again see memorials laid up, how did <lb/>
            there, ever an unexpected participation in good take place to <lb/>
            any one? It is well, therefore, to give thanks and to sing <lb/>
            hymns in honour of him who bestowed it. What, then, is the <note type="footnote"> * Deut. xxvii. 19. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Exodus xiv. 14. </note> <note type="footnote"> ‡ Exodus xi. 7. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="391"/>
            good ? The passion which is attacking us is dead, and is <lb/>
            thrown out on its face without burial. Let not us delay, but <lb/>
            Standing still, let us sing that most sacred and becoming <lb/>
            hymn, feeling that we are commanded to say to all men, " Let <lb/>
            us sing unto the Lord, for he has triumphed gloriously; the <lb/>
            horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea."* But the <lb/>
            rout and destruction of the passions is indeed a good, but not <lb/>
            a perfect good; but the discovery of wisdom is a surpassing <lb/>
            good, and when that is found all the people will sing harmo­ <lb/>
            nies and melodies, not with one kind of music only, but with <lb/>
            every sort; for then, says the scripture, “ Israel sang this <lb/>
            song at the well ;"t that is to say, in triumph for the fact <lb/>
            that knowledge, which had long been hidden but which was <lb/>
            sought for, had at length been found by all men, though lying <lb/>
            deep by nature ; the duty of which was to irrigate the rational <lb/>
            fields existing in the souls of those men who are fond of con­ <lb/>
            templation.</p>
          <p>What, then, shall we say ? When we bring home the <lb/>
            legitimate fruit of the mind, does not the sacred scripture en­ <lb/>
            join us to display in our reason, as in a sacred basket, the <lb/>
            first fruits of our fertility ; a specimen of the glorious flowers, <lb/>
            and shoots, and fruits which the soul has brought forth, bidding <lb/>
            us speak out distinctly, and to utter panegyrics on the God <lb/>
            who brings things to perfection, and to say, " I have cleared <lb/>
            away the things which were holy out of my house, and I have <lb/>
            arranged them in the house of God :”‡ appointing as stewards <lb/>
            and guardians of them, men selected for their superior merit, <lb/>
            and giving them the charge of these sacred things ; and these <lb/>
            persons are Levites. proselytes, and orphans, and widows. <lb/>
            But some are suppliants, some are emigrants and fugitives, <lb/>
            some are persons widowed and destitute of all created things, <lb/>
            but enrolled as belonging to God, the genuine husband and <lb/>
            father of the soul which is inclined to worship.</p>
          <p>XLIII. In this way, then, it is most proper both to speak <lb/>
            and to be silent. But the wicked adopt an exactly contrary <lb/>
            course; for they are admirers of a blamable kind of silence, <lb/>
            and of an interpretation open to reproach, practising both lines <lb/>
            of conduct to their own destruction and that of others. But <lb/>
            the greater part of their employment consists in saying what <lb/>
            they ought not; for having opened their mouth and leaving it <note type="footnote"> * Exodus xv. 1. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Numbers xxi. 17. </note> <note type="footnote"> ‡ Deut. xxvi. 13. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="392"/>
            unbridled, like an unrestrained torrent, they allow their speech <lb/>
            to run on indiscriminately, as the poets say, dragging on thou­ <lb/>
            sands of profitless sayings ; therefore those who have devoted <lb/>
            themselves to the advocacy of pleasure and appetite, and every <lb/>
            sort of excessive desire, building up irrational passion as a <lb/>
            fortification against dominant reason, and preparing them­ <lb/>
            selves for a contentious sort of discussion, have come at last to <lb/>
            a regular dispute, hoping to be able to blind the race which is <lb/>
            endowed with the faculty of sight, and to throw it down pre­ <lb/>
            cipices. and into depths from which it will not be able at any <lb/>
            future time to emerge. But some have not only put them­ <lb/>
            selves forward as rivals to human virtue, but have proceeded <lb/>
            to such a pitch of folly as to oppose themselves also to divine <lb/>
            virtue. Therefore Pharaoh, the king of the land of Egypt, is <lb/>
            spoken of as the leader of the company which is devoted to <lb/>
            the passions; for it is said to the prophet, " Behold, he is <lb/>
            going forth to the river, and thou shalt stand in the way to <lb/>
            meet him, on the bank of the river ;”* for it is the peculiar <lb/>
            characteristic of the one man to go forth to the rapidity and <lb/>
            continual pouring forth of the irrational passion ; and it is also <lb/>
            characteristic of the wise man to oppose with exceeding vigour <lb/>
            the arguments on behalf of pleasure and desire, not with his <lb/>
            feet, but with his mind, firmly and immoveably, standing on <lb/>
            the bank of the river; that is to say, on the mouth and on the <lb/>
            tongue, which are the organs of speech.</p>
          <p>For standing firmly on these, he will be able to overturn and <lb/>
            defeat the plausible specious arguments which advocate the <lb/>
            cause of passion. But the enemy of the race which is en­ <lb/>
            dowed with the power of seeing, is the people of Pharaoh, <lb/>
            which never ceased attacking, and persecuting, and enslaving <lb/>
            virtue, until . . . . it paid the penalty of the evils which <lb/>
            it inflicted being overwhelmed in the sea of those <lb/>
            iniquities ... which it excited, So that <lb/>
            that period exhibited an extraordinary sight, a victory which <lb/>
            was in no doubt, and a joy greater than could have been <lb/>
            hoped for.</p>
          <p>On which account it is said, " And Israel Raw the Egyp­ <lb/>
            tians dead upon the sea-shore."t Great indeed was the hand <lb/>
            which fought for them, compelling those who had sharpened <lb/>
            these organs against the truth to fall by the mouth, and lips, and <note type="footnote"> * Exodus vii. 15. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Exodus xiv. 30. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="393"/>
            speech, so that they who had taken up these weapons against <lb/>
            others should perish by their own arms and not by those of <lb/>
            others. And this announces three most glorious things to the <lb/>
            soul; one, the destruction of the passions of Egypt; another, <lb/>
            that this has taken place in no other spot than near the salt <lb/>
            and bitter springs, as if on the shore of the sea, by which <lb/>
            sophistical reason, that enemy of virtue, is poured forth ; and, <lb/>
            lastly, the sight of the disaster. For no glorious thing can be <lb/>
            invisible, but should be brought to the light and brilliancy of <lb/>
            the sun. For so also the contrary, namely evil, should be <lb/>
            thrust into deep darkness, and should be accounted deserving <lb/>
            of night. And may it indeed by chance happen to some one <lb/>
            to behold this: but what is really good should be always <lb/>
            beheld by more piercing eyes. And what is so good as that <lb/>
            what is good should live, and what is evil should die?</p>
          <p>XLIV. There were, therefore, three persons who uttered <lb/>
            atrocious words which were to reach even to heaven; these <lb/>
            men devoted themselves to studies against nature, or rather <lb/>
            against their own souls, saying that this universe was the only <lb/>
            thing which was perceptible to the outward senses, and visible, <lb/>
            having never been created, and being never destined to be <lb/>
            destroyed, but being uncreated and imperishable, not requiring <lb/>
            any superintendence, or care, or regulation, or management. <lb/>
            Afterwards piling up fresh attempts one upon another, they <lb/>
            built up a doctrine which was not approved, and raised it to a <lb/>
            height like a tower ; for it is said, “And the whole earth spoke <lb/>
            one language,"* an inharmonious agreement of all the portions <lb/>
            of the soul, for the purpose of overthrowing that which is the <lb/>
            most comprehensive of all existing principles, namely, au­ <lb/>
            thority.</p>
          <p>Therefore, a great and irresistible hand overthrew them <lb/>
            when they were hoping to mount up even to heaven by their <lb/>
            devices, for the purpose of destroying the everlasting kingdom ; <lb/>
            and it also dashed down the doctrine which they had built <lb/>
            up; and the place is called confusion: a very appropriate <lb/>
            name for such an audacious and wicked attempt; for what can <lb/>
            be more productive of confusion than anarchy? Are not <lb/>
            houses which have no manager full of offences and dis­ <lb/>
            turbances? And are not cities which are left unprovided <lb/>
            with a king destroyed by the domination of the mob, the <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xL 1. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="394"/>
            opposite evil to kingly power, and at the same time the <lb/>
            greatest of all evils ? And have not countries, and nations, <lb/>
            and regions of the earth, the governments of which have been <lb/>
            put down, lost all their ancient and great prosperity ?</p>
          <p>And why need I speak of matters of human history? For <lb/>
            even the other species of animals, flocks of birds, and herds of <lb/>
            terrestrial beasts, and shoals of aquatic creatures, never exist <lb/>
            without some leader of their company; but they always desire <lb/>
            and always pay attention to their own leader, as being the sole <lb/>
            cause of the advantages they receive; at whose absence they <lb/>
            are scattered and destroyed. Do we suppose then, that in the <lb/>
            case of earthly creatures, which are the most insignificant <lb/>
            portion of the universe, authority is the cause of good things <lb/>
            and anarchy the cause of evils, but that the world itself is not <lb/>
            filled with extreme happiness by reason of the administration <lb/>
            of God its king?</p>
          <p>Therefore they have suffered punishment corresponding to <lb/>
            their iniquities: for having polluted the sacred doctrine, <lb/>
            they saw themselves polluted in like manner, all authority <lb/>
            being taken away from among them; and being thrown them­ <lb/>
            selves into confusion, but not having really caused any. But <lb/>
            as long as they were left unpunished, being puffed up by <lb/>
            insane pride, they sought to overthrow the authority of the <lb/>
            universe by unholy speeches; and they set themselves up as <lb/>
            rulers and kings, attributing the irresistible power of God <lb/>
            to creatures which are perpetually coming to an end and <lb/>
            being destroyed.</p>
          <p>XLV. Therefore these ridiculous men giving themselves <lb/>
            tragic airs and using inflated language, are accustomed to <lb/>
            speak thus: we are they who are leaders; we are kings; <lb/>
            On us all things depend. Who, except ourselves, is the cause <lb/>
            of good and of the contrary? To whom, except to us, can the <lb/>
            doing well or ill be truly attributed ? They talk nonsense too <lb/>
            in another manner, saying, that all things depend upon an <lb/>
            invisible power, which they fancy presides over all human and <lb/>
            divine affairs in the whole world.</p>
          <p>Uttering such insolent falsehoods as these, if after intoxica­ <lb/>
            tion they have become sober, and have come to themselves <lb/>
            again, and feel ashamed of the intoxication to which they have <lb/>
            given way coming under the dominion of the external senses, <lb/>
            and if they reproach themselves for the evil actions which they <lb/>
             <pb n="395"/>
            have been led oil to commit by folly, giving ear to their new <lb/>
            counsellor, which never flatters, and which cannot be corrupted, <lb/>
            namely, repentance, having propitiated the merciful power of <lb/>
            the living God by sacred hymns of repentance instead of pro­ <lb/>
            fade songs, they will find entire forgiveness.</p>
          <p>But if they are restive and obstinate for ever, and indulge <lb/>
            in wanton behaviour, as if they were independent, and free, <lb/>
            and the rulers of others, then'by a necessity which is deaf to <lb/>
            all entreaties and implacable, they will learn to feel their own <lb/>
            nothingness in all things both small and great; for the driver <lb/>
            who mounts upon them, putting a bridle, upon this world, as <lb/>
            though it were a winged chariot, drawing back with main <lb/>
            strength the reins which before were loose, and pressing the bits <lb/>
            severely, will remind them by whip and spur of his authority <lb/>
            as master, which they, like wicked servants, have forgotten by <lb/>
            reason of the gentle and merciful temper of their manager; for <lb/>
            bad servants, looking upon the gentleness of masters as <lb/>
            anarchy, fancy themselves entiiely free from the power of any <lb/>
            master at all, until their owner checks their great and increas­ <lb/>
            ing disease by applying punishment as a remedy.</p>
          <p>For which reason the expression is used of " a lawless soul, <lb/>
            which with its lips distinguishes well-doing and evil-doing, <lb/>
            and then will subsequently announce its own sin."* What <lb/>
            sayest thou, 0 soul, full of insolence? For dost thou know <lb/>
            what real good or real evil, real justice or real holiness, are? <lb/>
            or what is suited to what ? The knowledge of those things and <lb/>
            the power of regulating them belongs to God alone, and to <lb/>
            whoever is dear to him. And witness is borne to this asser­ <lb/>
            tion by the scripture in which it is said, " I will kill and I will <lb/>
            cause to live ; I will smite and I will heal."f But the mind <lb/>
            which was wise in its own conceit had not even a superficial <lb/>
            dreaming intimation of the things placed above it: but, <lb/>
            wretched that it was, it was so completely carried away by the <lb/>
            wind of vain opinion that it swore that those things which it <lb/>
            had erroneously imagined stood firmly and solidly. If. there­ <lb/>
            fore, the violence and convulsion of the disease begin to relax, <lb/>
            the sparks of returning health becoming gradually re-kindled, <lb/>
            will compel it at first to confess its error, that is to say, to <lb/>
            reproach itself, and afterwards to become a suppliant at the <note type="footnote"> * Leviticus v. 4 </note> <note type="footnote"> t Deuteronomy xxxii. 39. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="396"/>
            altar, entreating with prayers, and supplications, and sacrifices, <lb/>
            that it may only obtain pardon.</p>
          <p>XLVI. After this who can fairly raise the question why the <lb/>
            historian of the scriptures has spoken of the river of Egypt <lb/>
            only as having banks and has made no such mention of the <lb/>
            Euphrates or of any other of the sacred rivers; for here he <lb/>
            says, " Thou shalt stand in the way to meet him by the bank <lb/>
            of the river." And yet perhaps some persons in a spirit of <lb/>
            ridicule will say that it is not right to bring such matters as <lb/>
            these forward for investigation, for that it rather displays a <lb/>
            spirit of cavilling than does any good. But I imagine that <lb/>
            such things, like sweetmeats, are prepared in the sacred scrip­ <lb/>
            tures, for the improvement of those who read them, and that <lb/>
            we ought not to condemn the curiosity of those who investigate <lb/>
            such matters, but that we should rather blame their indolence <lb/>
            if they did not investigate them.</p>
          <p>For our present discussion is not about the history of rivers <lb/>
            but about ways of life, which are compared to the streams of <lb/>
            rivers, running iu opposite directions to one another. For the <lb/>
            life of the good man consists in actions; but that of the <lb/>
            wicked man is seen to consist only in worlds. And speech <lb/>

          </head>
          <p>I. THE sacred laws having been written in five books, the <lb/>
            first is called and inscribed Genesis, deriving its title from the <lb/>
            creation (<foreign xml:lang="grc">γένεσις</foreign>) of the world, which it contains at the <lb/>
            beginning; although there are ten thousand other matters <lb/>
            also introduced which refer to peace and to war, or to fertility <lb/>
            and barrenness, or to hunger and plenty, or to the terrible <lb/>
            destructions which have taken place on earth by the agency of <lb/>
            fire and water ; or, on the contrary, to the birth and rapid <note type="footnote"> * The rest of this treatise is lost. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="397"/>
            propagation of animals and plants in accordance with the <lb/>
            admirable arrangement of the atmosphere, and the seasons of <lb/>
            the year, and of men, some of whom lived in accordance with <lb/>
            virtue, while others were associated with wickedness.</p>
          <p>But since of these things some are portions of the world, <lb/>
            and some are accidents, and since the world is the most per­ <lb/>
            fect and complete of all things, he has nominally assigned the <lb/>
            whole book to that subject.</p>
          <p>We have then examined with all the accuracy that was in <lb/>
            our power, in what manner the creation of the world was <lb/>
            arranged in our previous treatises; but since it is necessary, to <lb/>
            be consistent with the regular order in which the sacred history <lb/>
            proceeds to go on, now to investigate the laws, we will for the <lb/>
            present postpone the particular laws which are copies as it <lb/>
            were ; and first of all examine the more general laws which <lb/>
            are, as it were, the models of the others. Now these are those <lb/>
            men who have lived irreproachably and admirably, whose <lb/>
            virtues are durably and permanently recorded, as on pillars in <lb/>
            the sacred scriptures, not merely with the object of praising <lb/>
            the men themselves, but also for the sake of exhorting those <lb/>
            who read their history, and of leading them on to emulate their <lb/>
            conduct; for these men have been living and rational laws; <lb/>
            and the lawgiver has magnified them for two reasons ; first, <lb/>
            because he was desirous to show that the injunctions which <lb/>
            are thus given are not inconsistent with nature; and, secondly, <lb/>
            that he might prove that it is not very difficult or laborious <lb/>
            for those who wish to live according to the laws established in <lb/>
            these books, since the earliest men easily and spontaneously <lb/>
            obeyed the unwritten principle of legislation before any one <lb/>
            of the particular laws were written down at all.</p>
          <p>So that a man may very properly say, that the written laws <lb/>
            are nothing more than a memorial of the life of the ancients, <lb/>
            tracing back in an antiquarian spirit, the actions and reason­ <lb/>
            ings which they adopted; for these first men, without ever <lb/>
            having been followers or pupils of any one, and without ever <lb/>
            having been taught by preceptors what they ought to do or <lb/>
            say, but having embraced a line of conduct consistent with <lb/>
            nature from attending to their own natural impulses, and from <lb/>
            being prompted by an innate virtue, and looking upon nature <lb/>
            herself to be, what in fact she is, the most ancient and duly <lb/>
            established of laws, did in reality spend their whole lives in <lb/>
             <pb n="398"/>
            making laws, never of deliberate purpose doing anything <lb/>
            open to reproach, and for their accidental errors propitiating <lb/>
            God, and appeasing him by prayers and supplications, so as to <lb/>
            procure for themselves the enjoyment of an entire life of virtue <lb/>
            and prosperity, both in respect of their deliberate actions, and <lb/>
            those which proceeded from no voluntary purpose.</p>
          <p>II. Since then the beginning of all participation in good <lb/>
            things is hope, and since the soul devoted to virtue pioneers <lb/>
            and opens this path as a plain and easy one, being anxious to <lb/>
            attain to that which is really honourable, the sacred historian <lb/>
            has named the first lover of hope, Enos, giving him the com­ <lb/>
            mon name of the whole race as an especial favour. For the <lb/>
            Chaldæans call man Enos; as if he were the only real man, <lb/>
            who lived in expectation of good things, and who is established <lb/>
            in good hopes; from which it is evident that they do not look <lb/>
            upon the man devoid of hope as a man at all, but rather as an <lb/>
            animal resembling a man, inasmuch as he is deprived of that <lb/>
            most peculiar possession of the human soul, namely hope. <lb/>
            For which reason, being desirous to deliver an admirable <lb/>
            panegyric on the hopeful man, the sacred historian tells us, <lb/>
            first, that " he hoped in the father and creator of the <lb/>
            universe," * and adds in a subsequent passage, " This is the <lb/>
            book of the generation of men,"t and of their fathers, and <lb/>
            grand-fathers who had existed previously; but he conceived <lb/>
            that they were the ancestors of the mixed race, that is to say, <lb/>
            of that purer and thoroughly sifted race which is the really <lb/>
            rational one ; for, as the poet Homer, though the number of <lb/>
            poets is beyond all calculation, is called " the poet " by way of <lb/>
            distinction, and as the black [ink] with which we write is <lb/>
            called " the black," though in point of fact everything which <lb/>
            is not white is black; and as that archon at Athens is <lb/>
            especially called “ the archon," who is the archon eponymus <lb/>
            and the chief of the nine archons, from whom the chronology <lb/>
            is dated; so in the same manner the sacred historian calls <lb/>
            him who indulges in hope, "a man," by way of pre-eminence, <lb/>
            passing over in silence the rest of the multitude of human <lb/>
            beings, as not being worthy to receive the same appellation.</p>
          <p>And he has very properly called his first volume, the Book <lb/>
            of the Generation of the Real Man, speaking with perfect cor­ <lb/>
            rectness ; because the man who is full of good hope is worthy <note type="footnote"> * Genesis iv. 26. </note> <note type="footnote"> Genesis v. 1. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="399"/>
            of being described and remembered, not with such a memory <lb/>
            as is given by a record in papers, which are hereafter to be <lb/>
            destroyed by bookworms, but by that which exists in immortal <lb/>
            mature, where the virtuous actions are regularly recorded.</p>
          <p>If then any one were to reckon the generations, from the <lb/>
            first man, who was made out of the earth, he will find him <lb/>
            who, by the Chaldæans is called Enos, and in the Greek lan­ <lb/>
            guage <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἂνθςωπος</foreign> (the man), to be the fourth in succession, and <lb/>
            in numbers the number four is honoured among other philoso­ <lb/>
            phers, who have studied and admired the incorporeal essences, <lb/>
            appreciable only by the intellect, and especially by the all-wise <lb/>
            Moses, who magnifies the number four, and says that it is <lb/>
            " holy and praiseworthy and the reasons for which this cha­ <lb/>
            racter has been given to it are mentioned in a former treatise. <lb/>
            And the man who is full of good hope is likewise holy and <lb/>
            praiseworthy; as, on the contrary, he who has no hope is ac­ <lb/>
            cursed and blameable, being always associated with fear, which <lb/>
            is an evil counsellor in any emergency; for they say, that <lb/>
            there is no one thing so hostile to another, as hope is to fear <lb/>
            and fear to hope, and perhaps this may be correctly said, for <lb/>
            both fear and hope are an expectation, but the one is an ex­ <lb/>
            pectation of good things, and the other, on the contrary, of evil <lb/>
            things; and the natures of good and evil are irreconcileable, <lb/>
            and such as can never come together.</p>
          <p>III. What has now been said about hope is sufficient; and <lb/>
            nature has placed her at the gates to be a sort of doorkeeper <lb/>
            to the royal virtues within, which no one may approach who <lb/>
            has not previously paid homage to hope. Therefore the law­ <lb/>
            givers, and the laws in every state on earth, labour with great <lb/>
            diligence to fill the souls of free men with good hopes ; but he <lb/>
            who, without any recommendation and without being enjoined <lb/>
            to be so, is nevertheless hopeful, has acquired this virtue by an <lb/>
            unwritten, self-taught law, which nature has implanted in him.</p>
          <p>That which is placed in the next rank after hope is repent­ <lb/>
            ance for errors committed, and improvement; in reference to <lb/>
            which principle Moses mentions next in order to Enos, the <lb/>
            man who changed from a worse system of life to a better, who <lb/>
            is called among the Hebrews Enoch, but as the Greeks would <lb/>
            say, " gracious," of whom the following statement is made, <lb/>
            " that Enoch pleased God, and was not found, because God <lb/>
            transported him."t For transportation shows a change and <note type="footnote"> * Leviticus xix 21. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Genesis v. 24 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="400"/>
            alteration : and such a change is for the better, because it <lb/>
            takes place through the providence of God; for every thing <lb/>
            that is with God is in every case honourable and advantageous, <lb/>
            since that which is destitute of any divine superintendence is <lb/>
            useless and unprofitable.</p>
          <p>And the expression, " lie was not found,”* is very appro­ <lb/>
            priately employed of him whose place was changed, either <lb/>
            from the fact of his ancient blameable life being wiped out and <lb/>
            effaced, and being no longer found, just as if it had never existed <lb/>
            at all, or else because he whose place has been changed, and who <lb/>
            is enrolled in a better class, is naturally difficult to be disco­ <lb/>
            vered. For wickedness is a very multiform and extensive <lb/>
            thing, on which account it is known to many persons; but <lb/>
            virtue is rare, so that it is not comprehended even by a few. <lb/>
            And besides, the bad mail runs about through the market- <lb/>
            place, and theatres, and courts of justice, and council halls. <lb/>
            and assemblies, and every meeting and collection of men what­ <lb/>
            ever, like one who lives with and for curiosity, letting loose his <lb/>
            tongue in immoderate, and interminable, and indiscriminate <lb/>
            conversation, confusing and disturbing every thing, mixing up <lb/>
            what is true with what is false, what is unspeakable with what <lb/>
            is public, private with public things, things profane with things <lb/>
            sacred, what is ridiculous with what is excellent, from never <lb/>
            having been instructed in what is the most excellent thing in <lb/>
            season, namely silence. And pricking up his ears, because of <lb/>
            the abundance of his leisure, and his superfluous curiosity, and <lb/>
            love of interference, he is eager to make himself acquainted <lb/>
            with the business of other people, whether good or bad, so as <lb/>
            at once to envy those who are prosperous, and to rejoice over <lb/>
            those who are not so; for the bad man is by nature envious <lb/>
            and a hater of all that is good, and a lover of all that is evil.</p>
          <p>IV. But the good man, on the contrary, is a lover of that <lb/>
            mode of life which is not troubled by business, and withdraws, <lb/>
            and loves solitude, desiring to escape the notice of the many, <lb/>
            not out of misanthropy, for he is a lover of mankind, if any <lb/>
            one in the world is so, but because he eschews wickedness, <lb/>
            which the chief multitude eagerly embraces, rejoicing at what <lb/>
            it ought to mourn over, and grieving at what it is becoming <lb/>
            rather to rejoice. On which account the good man shuts him­ <lb/>
            self up, and remains for the most part at home, scarcely going <note type="footnote"> * This is not the translation of the bible which savs " and Enoch <lb/>
            walked with God, and he was not, for God took him " </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="401"/>
            over his threshold, or if he does go out, for the sake of avoiding <lb/>
            the crowds who come to visit him. he generally goes out of the <lb/>
            city, and makes his abode in some country place, living more <lb/>
            pleasantly with such companions as are the most virtuous of all <lb/>
            mankind, whose bodies, indeed, time has dissolved, but whose <lb/>
            virtues the records which are left of them keep alive, in poems <lb/>
            and in prose, histories by which the soul is naturally improved <lb/>
            and led on to perfection.</p>
          <p>It is on this account that the sacred historian has said that <lb/>
            the man whose place was changed was not found, inasmuch as <lb/>
            he is difficult to find and hard to seek out. Therefore, such a <lb/>
            man emigrates from ignorance to instruction, and from folly <lb/>
            to wisdom, and from cowardice to courage, and from impiety <lb/>
            to piety; and, again, from devotion to pleasure to temperance, <lb/>
            and from vain-gloriousness to simplicity, qualities superior to <lb/>
            all riches, and more valuable as a possession than any royal or <lb/>
            imperial power. For if one may speak the plain truth, that <lb/>
            wealth which is not blind, but which is clear-sighted, is the <lb/>
            abundance of virtues, which we must at once conclude to be <lb/>
            the genuine and legitimate predominance of good in compari­ <lb/>
            son of all other bastard and falsely named powers, and to be <lb/>
            the just and lawful superior of them all. But we must not be <lb/>
            ignorant that repentance occupies the second place only, next <lb/>
            after perfection, just as the change from sickness to convales­ <lb/>
            cence is inferior to perfect uninterrupted health. Therefore, <lb/>
            that which is continuous and perfect in virtues is very near <lb/>
            divine power, but that condition which is improvement <lb/>
            advancing in process of time is the peculiar blessing of a well- <lb/>
            disposed soul, which does not continue in its childish pursuits, <lb/>
            but by more vigorous thoughts and inclinations, such as really <lb/>
            become a man, seeks a tranquil steadiness of soul, and which <lb/>
            attains to it by its conception of what is good.</p>
          <p>V. For which reason the sacred historian very naturally <lb/>
            classes the lover of God and the lover of virtue next in order to <lb/>
            him who repents; and this man is in the language of the <lb/>
            Hebrews called Noah, but in that of the Greeks, "rest," or <lb/>
            “ the just man," both being appellations very well suited to <lb/>
            the wise man. That of " the just man " most evidently so, <lb/>
            for nothing is better than justice, which is the chief among <lb/>
            virtues, and which receives the highest honours like the most <lb/>
            beautiful member of a company; and the appellation " rest ” <note type="footnote"> VOL. II. </note> <note type="footnote"> D D </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="402"/>
            is likewise appropriate, since the opposite quality to rest is <lb/>
            unnatural agitation, the cause of confusions, and tumults, and <lb/>
            seditious, and wars, which the wicked pursue; while those <lb/>
            who pay due honour to excellence cultivate a tranquil, and <lb/>
            quiet, and stable, and peaceful life.</p>
          <p>And in strict consistency with himself, the lawgiver also <lb/>
            calls the seventh day " rest, " which the Hebrews call " the <lb/>
            sabbath; " not as some persons fancy, because after six days <lb/>
            the multitude was restrained from its habitual employments, but <lb/>
            because in real truth, the number seven is both in the world <lb/>
            and in ourselves free from seditions and from wars, and is of <lb/>
            all the numbers that which is the most averse to contention, <lb/>
            and the greatest lover of peace. And a proof of what I have <lb/>
            here asserted may be found in the powers which exist in us; <lb/>
            for six of those powers, namely the five outward senses and <lb/>
            uttered speech, stir up continued and ceaseless war, both by <lb/>
            sea and land, some of them doing so from a desire for the <lb/>
            objects of the outward senses, which if they cannot obtain <lb/>
            they are grieved, and the last by divulging with unbridled <lb/>
            mouth numbers of things which ought to be buried in silence. <lb/>
            But the seventh power is that which proceeds from the domi­ <lb/>
            nant mind, which is more glorious than the other six powers, <lb/>
            and which has by pre-eminent vigour obtained the mastery <lb/>
            over them all, and when that retires, choosing solitude, and its <lb/>
            own society, and living by itself, as one that has no need of <lb/>
            any other, and that is all-sufficient for itself, being then <lb/>
            emancipated from the cares and troubles that are found in the <lb/>
            human race, embraces a calm and tranquil life.</p>
          <p>VI. And the lawgiver magnifies the lover of virtue in such <lb/>
            a way, that even when he is giving his genealogy, he does not <lb/>
            trace him as he usually does other persons, by giving a cata­ <lb/>
            logue of his grandfathers and great grandfathers, and ances­ <lb/>
            tors who are numbered as men and women, but he gives a list <lb/>
            of certain virtues; and almost asserts in express words that <lb/>
            there is no other house, or kindred, or country whatever to a <lb/>
            wise man, except the virtues and the actions in accordance <lb/>
            with virtues.</p>
          <p>" For these," says he, " are the generations of Noah ; Noah <lb/>
            was a just man, perfect in his generation, and one who pleased <lb/>
            God."* But we must not be ignorant that when he says man <note type="footnote"> * Genesis vL 9. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="403"/>
            here, he does not mean merely to use the common expression <lb/>
            for a rational mortal animal, but that he means to indicate in <lb/>
            an eminent degree him who verifies the name, having driven <lb/>
            away all the untameable and furious passions and brutal <lb/>
            wickednesses of the soul; and as a proof of this, after the word <lb/>
            man he adds as an epithet, “ the just,” saying, " a just man," <lb/>
            as if no unjust person were a man at all, but to speak more <lb/>
            properly a beast in the likeness of a man, and as if he alone <lb/>
            were a man who is an admirer of justice ; he also says that he <lb/>
            was "perfect," intimating by this expression that he was pos­ <lb/>
            sessed not of one virtue only but of all, and that being so <lb/>
            possessed of them, he constantly exhibited every one of them <lb/>
            according to his power and opportunities ; and finally crown­ <lb/>
            ing him like a wrestler who has gained a glorious victory, he <lb/>
            honours him moreover with a most noble proclamation, saying <lb/>
            that " he pleased God," (and what can there be in nature that <lb/>
            is more excellent than this panegyric?) which is the most <lb/>
            visible proof of excellence; for if they who displease God are <lb/>
            miserable, those who please him are by all means happy.</p>
          <p>VII. It is not then without great correctness that after he <lb/>
            has praised the man as being possessed of such great virtues <lb/>
            he adds, “ that he was perfect in his generation." Showing <lb/>
            that he was not perfect absolutely, but that he was good in <lb/>
            comparison with the others who lived at that time ; for in a <lb/>
            little time he will also speak of other wise men who were <lb/>
            possessed of unconquerable and incomparable virtue, not <lb/>
            merely if contrasted with the wicked, nor because they were <lb/>
            better than the other men of their age, and as such were <lb/>
            considered worthy of acceptance and pre-eminence, but because <lb/>
            having received a well disposed nature, they preserved it with­ <lb/>
            out any error or change for the worse; not fleeing from evil <lb/>
            habits, but never having once fallen into them, and being by <lb/>
            deliberate purpose practisers of all virtuous actions and <lb/>
            speeches, by which system they have adorned their life.</p>
          <p>Those then are the most admirable of all men who have <lb/>
            adopted free and noble inclinations, not in imitation of or by <lb/>
            way of contrast to others, but from an inclination to genuine <lb/>
            virtue and justice for its own sake ; he also is to be admired <lb/>
            who is superior to his own generation and his own age, and <lb/>
            who is overcome by none of those things which the multitude <lb/>
            follows; and he will be classed in the second rank, and nature <note type="footnote"> D D 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="404"/>
            will give to such men the best of her prizes; and the second <lb/>
            prize is of itself a great thing; for what is not a great and <lb/>
            most desirable object which God offers to, and bestows upon <lb/>
            men ? And the greatest proof of this is to be found in the <lb/>
            exceeding graces which this man attained to ; for as that time <lb/>
            bore an abundant crop of injustice and impiety, and so every <lb/>
            country, and nation, and city, and house, and every separate <lb/>
            individual was full of wicked practices, all men of free will and <lb/>
            of deliberate purpose, as if in an arena, living with one another <lb/>
            for the first rank in iniquity, and strove with all possible zeal <lb/>
            and rivalry, every one seeking to surpass his neighbour in the <lb/>
            magnitude of his wickedness, and failing in nothing which <lb/>
            might render life blameable and accursed.</p>
          <p>VIII. At whom God, being naturally indignant, and being <lb/>
            angry that that which appeared to be the most excellent of <lb/>
            animals, and which had been thought worthy of being reckoned <lb/>
            akin to himself by reason of his participation in reason, when <lb/>
            he ought to have practised virtue, devoted himself rather to <lb/>
            wickedness, and to every species of vice, appointed a fitting <lb/>
            punishment for them, and determined to destroy the whole <lb/>
            race at that time existing by a deluge; and not only those who <lb/>
            dwelt in the champaign country and in the lower districts, <lb/>
            but those also who lived in the most lofty mountains, for the <lb/>
            great deep,* being raised to a height which it had never <lb/>
            reached before, burst through its mouths with its whole col­ <lb/>
            lective impetuosity into the seas existing among us, and 'they <lb/>
            overflowed and inundated all the islands and continents; and <lb/>
            incessant floods of everlasting fountains, and of native rivers <lb/>
            and torrents combined together, mingled with one another, <lb/>
            and rising to a vast height, so as to surmount everything. <lb/>
            Nor indeed was the air tranquil, for a deep and unbroken <lb/>
            cloud overspread the whole heaven, and there were fearful <lb/>
            storms of wind, and roarings of thunder, and flashes of light­ <lb/>
            ning, and rapid hurlings of thunderbolts, ceaseless storms of <lb/>
            rain being poured forth, so that one might have thought that <lb/>
            all the parts of the universe were hastening to dissolve them­ <lb/>
            selves into the one element of the nature of water, until, <lb/>
            while the water from above kept pouring down, and that below <lb/>
            kept bursting up, the streams were raised to a height above <note type="footnote"> * Genesis vii. 11. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="405"/>
            everything, so that they not only overwhelmed and hid from <lb/>
            sight all the plains and all the level ground, but even the tops <lb/>
            of the highest mountains, for every part of the earth was <lb/>
            under water, so that it was wholly buried and carried away, <lb/>
            and the world was mutilated of huge portions, and appeared <lb/>
            in all its wholeness and integrity, fearful as it is to say or <lb/>
            even to imagine such a thing, to be utterly crippled and <lb/>
            destroyed.</p>
          <p>And likewise the air, with the exception of that small <lb/>
            portion which is about the moon, was wholly obscured, being <lb/>
            overcast by the violence and impetuosity of the water which <lb/>
            overran all the region belonging to it with irresistible might. <lb/>
            Then were speedily destroyed all the crops and all the trees, <lb/>
            for an unlimited quantity of water is as destructive to them as <lb/>
            a scarcity, and innumerable flocks of animals, both tame and <lb/>
            wild, perished at the same time; for it was natural when the <lb/>
            most excellent race of all, that of man, had been destroyed, <lb/>
            that none of the inferior races should be left, since they <lb/>
            were only created to be slaves to his necessities, and to be <lb/>
            in a manner subject to his authoritative commands as their <lb/>
            master.</p>
          <p>When such numbers then of such mighty evils had burst <lb/>
            forth which that time poured out-for all the portions of the <lb/>
            world, except the heaven itself, were moved in an unnatural <lb/>
            manner-as if they were stricken with a terrible and deadly <lb/>
            disease.</p>
          <p>And one house alone, that of the aforesaid just and God- <lb/>
            loving man who had received the two highest of all gifts, was <lb/>
            preserved ; one gift being, as I have said already, the not <lb/>
            being destroyed with all the rest of mankind, the other that <lb/>
            of becoming himself, at a subsequent period, the founder of a <lb/>
            new generation of mankind ; for God thought him worthy to <lb/>
            be both the end of our race and the beginning of it, the end <lb/>
            of those men who lived before the deluge, and the beginning <lb/>
            of those who lived after the deluge.</p>
          <p>IX. Such was he who was the most virtuous of all the men <lb/>
            of his age, and such were the rewards which were allotted to him <lb/>
            which the holy scriptures enumerate ; and the arrangement and <lb/>
            classification of the aforesaid three, whether you call them men <lb/>
            or dispositions of the soul, is very symmetrical, for the perfect <lb/>
            man is entire from the beginning; but he who has his place <lb/>
             <pb n="406"/>
            changed is but half entire, having appropriated the earlier <lb/>
            period of his life to wickedness, and the subsequent time to <lb/>
            virtue to which he afterwards came over, and with which at <lb/>
            that subsequent time he lived. But he who hopes, as his very <lb/>
            name shows, has still a defect, for though he is always wishing <lb/>
            for what is good, he is not as yet able to attain to it, but he is <lb/>
            like those who are on a voyage, who while they are eager to reach <lb/>
            the harbour, are still kept at sea without being able to anchor <lb/>
            in port.</p>
          <p>X. I have now then explained the character of the first <lb/>
            triad of those who desire virtue. There is also another more <lb/>
            important company of which we must now proceed to speak, <lb/>
            for the former resembles those branches of instruction which <lb/>
            are allotted to the age of childhood, but this resembles rather <lb/>
            the gymnastic exercises of athletic men, who are really prepar­ <lb/>
            ing themselves for the sacred contests, who, despising all care <lb/>
            of getting their body into proper condition, labour to bring <lb/>
            about a healthy state of the soul, being desirous of that victory <lb/>
            which is to be gained over the adverse passions.</p>
          <p>The particulars then on which each individual differs from <lb/>
            the other, though all are hastening to one and the same end, <lb/>
            we will hereafter examine more minutely; but it is necessary <lb/>
            not to pass over in silence what it seems desirable to premise <lb/>
            concerning the whole three taken together.</p>
          <p>It happens then that they are all three of one household <lb/>
            and of one family, for the last of the three is the son of the <lb/>
            middle one, and the grandson of the first; and they are all <lb/>
            lovers of God, and beloved by God, loving the only God, and <lb/>
            being loved in return by him who has chosen, as the holy <lb/>
            scriptures tell us, by reason of the excess of their virtues in <lb/>
            which they lived, to give them also a share of the same appel­ <lb/>
            lation as himself; for having added his own peculiar name to <lb/>
            their names he has united them together, appropriating to <lb/>
            himself an appellation composed of the three names: "For," <lb/>
            says God, " this is my everlasting name: I am the God of <lb/>
            Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob,"* <lb/>
            using there the relative term instead of the absolute one ; and <lb/>
            this is very natural, for God stands in no need of a name. <lb/>
            But though he does not stand in any such need, nevertheless <lb/>
            he bestows his own title on the human race that they may <note type="footnote"> * Exodus iii. 15. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="407"/>
            have a refuge to which to betake themselves in supplications <lb/>
            and prayers, and so may not be destitute of a good hope.</p>
          <p>XI. This then is what appears to be said of these holy <lb/>
            men; and it is indicative of a nature more remote from our <lb/>
            knowledge than, and much superior to, that which exists in <lb/>
            the objects of outward sense; for the sacred word appears <lb/>
            thoroughly to investigate and to describe the different dispo­ <lb/>
            sitions of the soul, being all of them good, the one aiming at <lb/>
            what is good by means of instruction, the second by nature, <lb/>
            the last by practice; for the first, who is named Abraham, is a <lb/>
            symbol of that virtue which is derived from instruction; the <lb/>
            intermediate Isaac is an emblem of natural virtue; the <lb/>
            third, Jacob, of that virtue which is devoted to and derived <lb/>
            from practice. But we must not be ignorant that each of <lb/>
            these men was endowed with all these powers, but that each <lb/>
            derived his name from that one which predominated in him <lb/>
            and mastered the others ; for neither is it possible for instruc­ <lb/>
            tion to be made perfect without natural endowments and <lb/>
            practice, nor is nature able to arrive at the goal without <lb/>
            instruction and practice, nor is practice unless it be founded <lb/>
            on natural gifts and sound instruction.</p>
          <p>Very appropriately, therefore, has he represented, as united <lb/>
            by relationship, these three, which in name indeed are men, but <lb/>
            in reality, as I have said before, virtues, nature, instruction, and <lb/>
            practice, which men also call by another name, and entitle <lb/>
            them the three graces (<foreign xml:lang="grc">χάϱιτες</foreign>), either from the fact of God <lb/>
            having bestowed (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ϰεχαϱίσθαι</foreign>) on our race those three powers, <lb/>
            in order to produce the perfection of life, or because they <lb/>
            themselves have bestowed themselves on the rational soul as <lb/>
            the most glorious of gifts, so that the eternal name, as set <lb/>
            forth in the scriptures, may not be used in conjunction with <lb/>
            three men, but rather with the aforesaid powers; for the <lb/>
            nature of mankind is mortal, but that of the virtues is im­ <lb/>
            mortal ; and it is more reasonable that the name of the ever­ <lb/>
            lasting God should be conjoined with what is immortal than <lb/>
            with what is mortal, since what is immortal is akin to what is <lb/>
            imperishable, but death is hostile to it.</p>
          <p>XII. We must, however, not remain in ignorance that the <lb/>
            sacred historian has represented the first man, him who was <lb/>
            formed out of the earth as the father of all those who existed <lb/>
            before the deluge; and him who, with his whole family, was <lb/>
             <pb n="408"/>
            the only person left out of so universal a destruction, because of <lb/>
            his justice and his other excellencies and virtues, as the founder <lb/>
            of the new race of men which was to flourish hereafter. And <lb/>
            that venerable, and estimable, and glorious triad is compre­ <lb/>
            bended by the sacred scriptures under one class, and called, <lb/>
            "A royal priesthood, and a holy nation."* And its name <lb/>
            shows its power; for the nation is further called, in the lan­ <lb/>
            guage of the Hebrews, Israel, which name being interpreted <lb/>
            means, " seeing God."</p>
          <p>But of sight, that which is exercised by means of the eyes <lb/>
            is the most excellent of all the outward senses, since by that <lb/>
            alone all the most beautiful of existing things are compre­ <lb/>
            hended, the sun and the moon, and the whole heaven, and the <lb/>
            whole world; but the sight of the soul which is exercised, <lb/>
            through the medium of its dominant part excels all the other <lb/>
            powers of the soul, as much as the powers of the soul excel all <lb/>
            other powers ; and this is prudence, which is the sight of the <lb/>
            mind. But he to whose lot it falls, not only by means of his <lb/>
            knowledge, to comprehend all the other things which exist in <lb/>
            nature, but also to behold the Father and Creator of the <lb/>
            universe, has advanced to the very summit of happiness. For <lb/>
            there is nothing above God; and if any one, directing towards <lb/>
            him the eye of the soul, has reached up to him, let him then <lb/>
            pray for ability to remain and to stand firm before him; for <lb/>
            the roads which lead upwards to him are laborious and slow, <lb/>
            but the descent down the declivity, being rather like a rapid <lb/>
            dragging down than a gradual descent, is swift and easy. And <lb/>
            there are many things urged downwards, in which there is no <lb/>
            use whatever, when God having made the soul to depend on <lb/>
            his own powers, drags it up towards himself with a more <lb/>
            vigorous attraction.</p>
          <p>XIII. Let thus much, then, be said generally about the <lb/>
            three persons, since it was absolutely necessary ; but we must <lb/>
            now proceed in regular order, to speak of those qualities in <lb/>
            which each separate individual surpasses the others, beginning <lb/>
            with him who is first mentioned. Now he, being an admirer <lb/>
            of piety, the highest and greatest of all virtues, laboured <lb/>
            earnestly to follow God, and to be obedient to the injunctions <lb/>
            delivered by him, looking not only on those things as his com­ <lb/>
            mands which were signified to him by words and facts, but <note type="footnote"> * Exodus xix. G. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="409"/>
            those also which were indicated by more express signs through <lb/>
            the medium of nature, and which the truest of the outward <lb/>
            senses comprehends before the uncertain and untrustworthy <lb/>
            hearing can do so; for if any one observes the arrangement <lb/>
            which exists in nature, and the constitution according to which <lb/>
            the world goes on, which is more excellent than any kind of <lb/>
            reasoning, he learns, even though no one speaks to him, to <lb/>
            study a course of life consistent with law and peace, looking to <lb/>
            the example of good men. But the most manifest demon­ <lb/>
            strations of peace are those which the scriptures contain; and <lb/>
            we must mention the first which also occurs the first in the <lb/>
            order in which they are set down.</p>
          <p>XIV. He being impressed by an oracle by which he was <lb/>
            commanded to leave his country, and his kindred, and his <lb/>
            father's house, and to emigrate like a man returning from a <lb/>
            foreign land to his own country, and not like one who was <lb/>
            about to set out from his own land to settle in a foreign <lb/>
            district, hastened eagerly on, thinking to do with promptness <lb/>
            what he was commanded to do was equivalant to perfecting <lb/>
            the matter. And yet who else was it likely would be so un­ <lb/>
            deviating and unchangeable as not to be won over by and as <lb/>
            not to yield to the charms of one's relations and one's country ? <lb/>
            The love for which has in a manner­ <lb/>
            " Grown with the growth and strengthened with the strength,” <lb/>
            of every individual, and even more, or at all events not less <lb/>
            than the limbs united to the body have done.</p>
          <p>And we have witnesses of this in the lawgivers who have <lb/>
            enacted the second punishment next to death, namely, banish <lb/>
            ment, against those who are convicted of the most atrocious <lb/>
            crimes: a punishment which indeed is not second to any, as it <lb/>
            appears to me, if truth be the judge, but which is, in fact, <lb/>
            much more grievous than death, since death is the end of all <lb/>
            misfortunes, but banishment is not the end but the beginning <lb/>
            of new calamities, inflicting instead of our death unaccompanied <lb/>
            by pain ten thousand deaths with acute sensation.</p>
          <p>Some men also, being engaged in traffic, do out of desire for <lb/>
            gain sail over the sea, or being employed in some embassy, or <lb/>
            being led by a desire to see the sights of foreign countries, or <lb/>
            by a love for instruction, having various motives which attract <lb/>
            them outwards and prevent their remaining where they are, <lb/>
             <pb n="410"/>
            some being led by a love of gain, others by the idea of being <lb/>
            able to benefit their native city at its time of need in the most <lb/>
            necessary and important particulars, others seeking to arrive <lb/>
            at the knowledge of matters of which before they were ignorant, <lb/>
            a knowledge which brings, at the same time, both delight and <lb/>
            advantage to the soul. For men who have never travelled are <lb/>
            to those who have, as blind men are to those who see clearly, <lb/>
            are nevertheless anxious to behold their father's threshold and <lb/>
            to salute it, and to embrace their acquaintances, and to enjoy <lb/>
            the most delightful and wished-for sight of their relations and <lb/>
            friends; and very often, seeing the affairs, for the sake oi <lb/>
            which they left their country, protracted, they have abandoned <lb/>
            them, being influenced by that most powerful feeling of longing <lb/>
            for a union with their kindred.</p>
          <p>But this man with a very few companions, or perhaps I <lb/>
            might say by himself, as soon as he was commanded to do so, <lb/>
            left his home, and set out on an expedition to a foreign country <lb/>
            in his soul even before he started with his body, his regard for <lb/>
            mortal things being overpowered by his love for heavenly things. <lb/>
            Therefore giving no consideration to anything whatever, neither <lb/>
            to the men of his tribe, nor to those of his borough, nor to his <lb/>
            fellow disciples, nor to his companions, nor to those of his blood <lb/>
            as sprung from the same father or the same mother, nor to his <lb/>
            country, nor to his ancient habits, nor to the customs in which <lb/>
            lie had been brought up, nor to his mode of life and his mates, <lb/>
            every one of which things has a seductive and almost irresist­ <lb/>
            ible attraction and power, he departed as speedily as possible, <lb/>
            yielding to a free and unrestrained impulse, and first of all <lb/>
            he quitted the land of the Chaldaeans, a prosperous district, <lb/>
            and one which was greatly flourishing at that period, and went <lb/>
            into the land of Charran, and from that, after no very distant <lb/>
            interval, he departed to another place, which we will speak of <lb/>
            hereafter, when we have first discussedt he country of Charran.</p>
          <p>XV. The aforesaid emigrations, if one is to be guided by <lb/>
            the literal expressions of the scripture, were performed by a <lb/>
            wise man; but if we look to the laws of allegory, by a soul <lb/>
            devoted to virtue and busied in the search after the true God. <lb/>
            For the Chaldæans were, above all nations, addicted to the <lb/>
            study of astronomy, and attributed all events to the motions <lb/>
            of the stars, by which they fancied that all the things in the <lb/>
            world were regulated, and accordingly they magnified the <lb/>
             <pb n="411"/>
            visible essence by the powers which numbers and the analogies <lb/>
            of numbers contain, taking no account of the invisible essence <lb/>
            appreciable only by the intellect. But while they were busied <lb/>
            in investigating the arrangement existing in them with refer­ <lb/>
            ence to the periodical revolutions of the sun, and moon, and the <lb/>
            other planets, and fixed-stars, and the changes of the seasons <lb/>
            of the year, and the sympathy of the heavenly bodies with the <lb/>
            things of earth, they were led to imagine that the world itself <lb/>
            was God, in their impious philosophy comparing the creature <lb/>
            to the Creator.</p>
          <p>The man who had been bred up in this doctrine, and who <lb/>
            for a long time had studied the philosophy of the Chaldæans, <lb/>
            as if suddenly awakening from a deep slumber and opening <lb/>
            the eye of the soul, and beginning to perceive a pure ray of <lb/>
            light instead of profound darkness, followed the light, and saw <lb/>
            what he had never seen before, a certain governor and director <lb/>
            of the world standing above it, and guiding his own work in a <lb/>
            salutary manner, and exerting his care and power in behalf of <lb/>
            all those parts of it which are worthy of divine superin­ <lb/>
            tendence.</p>
          <p>In order, therefore, that he may the more firmly establish <lb/>
            the sight which has thus been presented to him in his mind, <lb/>
            the sacred word says to him, My good friend, great things are <lb/>
            often- made known by slight outlines, at which he who looks <lb/>
            increases his imagination to an unlimited extent; therefore, <lb/>
            having dismissed those who bend all their attention to the <lb/>
            heavenly bodies, and discarding the Chaldaean science, rise up <lb/>
            and depart for a short time from the greatest of cities, this <lb/>
            world, to one which is smaller ; for so you will be the better <lb/>
            able to comprehend the nature of the Ruler of the universe.</p>
          <p>It is for this reason that Abraham is said to have made his <lb/>
            first migration from the country of the Chaldæans into the land <lb/>
            of Charran.</p>
          <p>XVI. But Charran, in the Greek language, means “holes," <lb/>
            which is a figurative emblem of the regions of our outward <lb/>
            senses ; by means of which, as by holes, each of those senses <lb/>
            is able to look out so as to comprehend the objects which <lb/>
            belong to it. But, some one may say, what is the use of these <lb/>
            holes, unless the invisible mind, like the exhibition of a puppet <lb/>
            show, does from within prompt its own powers, which at one <lb/>
            time losing and allowing to roam, and at another time holding <lb/>
            back and restraining by force ? He gives sometimes an harmo­ <lb/>
             <pb n="412"/>
            nious motion, and sometimes perfect quiet to his puppets. And <lb/>
            having this example at home, you will easily comprehend that <lb/>
            being, the understanding of whom you are so anxious to arrive <lb/>
            at; unless, indeed, you fancy that the world is situated in you <lb/>
            as the dominant part of you, which the whole common powers <lb/>
            of the body obey, and which each of the outward senses fol­ <lb/>
            lows ; but that the world, the most beautiful, and greatest, and <lb/>
            most perfect of works, of which everything else is. but a part, <lb/>
            is destitute of any king to hold it together, and to regulate it, <lb/>
            and govern it in accordance with justice.</p>
          <p>And if it be invisible, wonder not at that, for neither can the <lb/>
            mind which is in thee be perceived by the sight. Any one who <lb/>
            considers this, deriving his proofs not from a distance but close <lb/>
            at hand, both from himself and from the circumstances around <lb/>
            him, will clearly see that the world is not the first God, but <lb/>
            that it is the work of the first God and Father of all things, <lb/>
            who, being himself invisible, displays every thing, showing <lb/>
            the nature of all things both small and great. For he has not <lb/>
            chosen to be beheld by the eyes of the body, perhaps because <lb/>
            it was not consistent with holiness for what is mortal to touch <lb/>
            what is everlasting, or perhaps because of the weakness of our <lb/>
            sight; for it would never have been able to stand the rays <lb/>
            which are poured forth from the living God, since it cannot <lb/>
            even look straight at the rays of the sun.</p>
          <p>XVII. And the most visible proof of this migration <lb/>
            in which the mind quitted astronomy and the doctrines of <lb/>
            the Chaldæans, is this. For it is said in the scriptures <lb/>
            that the very moment that the wise man quitted his abode, <lb/>
            " God appeared unto Abraham,"* to whom, therefore, it <lb/>
            is plain that he was not visible before, when he was adher. <lb/>
            ing to the studies of the Chaldæans, and attending to the <lb/>
            motions of the stars, not properly comprehending any nature <lb/>
            whatever, which was well arranged and appreciable by the <lb/>
            intellect only, apart from the world and the essence perceptible <lb/>
            by the outward senses. But after he changed his abode and <lb/>
            went into another country he learnt of necessity that the world <lb/>
            was subject, and not independent; not an absolute ruler, but <lb/>
            governed by the great cause of all things who had created it, <lb/>
            whom the mind then for the first time looked up and saw; for <lb/>
            previously a great mist was shed over it by the objects of the <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xii. 7. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="413"/>
            external senses, which she, having dissipated by fervent and <lb/>
            vivid doctrines, was scarcely able, as if in clear fine weather, to <lb/>
            perceive him who had previously been concealed and invisible.</p>
          <p>But he, by reason of his love for mankind, did not reject the <lb/>
            soul which came to him, but went forward to meet it, and <lb/>
            showed to it his own nature as far as it was possible that he <lb/>
            who was looking at it could see it. For which reason it is <lb/>
            said, not that the wise man saw God but that God appeared to <lb/>
            the wise man ; for it was impossible for any one to comprehend <lb/>
            by his own unassisted power the true living God, unless he <lb/>
            himself displayed and revealed himself to him.</p>
          <p>XVIII. And there is evidence in support of what has here <lb/>
            been said to be derived from the change and alteration of his <lb/>
            name : for he was anciently called Abram, but afterwards he <lb/>
            was named Abraham : the alteration of sound being only that <lb/>
            which proceeds from one single letter, alpha, being doubled, <lb/>
            but the alteration revealing in effect an important fact and <lb/>
            doctrine ; for the name Abram being interpreted means " sub­ <lb/>
            lime father;" but Abraham signifies, " the elect father of <lb/>
            sound." The first name being expressive of the man who is <lb/>
            called an astronomer, and one addicted to the contemplation <lb/>
            of the sublime bodies in the sky, and who was versed in the <lb/>
            doctrines of the Chaldæans, and who took care of them as a <lb/>
            father might take care of his children. But the last name <lb/>
            intimating the really wise man; for the latter name, by the <lb/>
            word sound, intimates the uttered speech; and by the word <lb/>
            father, the dominant mind. For the speech which is con­ <lb/>
            ceived within is naturally the father of that which is uttered, <lb/>
            inasmuch as it is older than the latter, and as it also suggests <lb/>
            what is to be said. And by the addition of the word elect his <lb/>
            goodness is intimated.</p>
          <p>For the evil disposition is a random and confused one, but <lb/>
            that which is elect is good, having been selected from all <lb/>
            others by reason of its excellence. Therefore, to him who is <lb/>
            addicted to the contemplation of the sublime bodies of the sky <lb/>
            there appears to be nothing whatever greater than the world; <lb/>
            and therefore he refers the causes of all things that exist to <lb/>
            the world. But the wise man, beholding with more accurate <lb/>
            eyes that more perfect being that rules and governs all things, <lb/>
            and is appreciable only by the intellect, to whom all things are <lb/>
            subservient as to a master, and by whom every thing is <lb/>
             <pb n="414"/>
            directed, very often reproaches himself for his former way of <lb/>
            life, and if he had lived the existence of a blind man, leaning <lb/>
            upon objects perceptible by the outward senses, on things by <lb/>
            their very nature worthless and unstable.</p>
          <p>The second migration is again undertaken by the virtuous <lb/>
            man under the influence of a sacred oracle, but this is no <lb/>
            longer one from one city to another, but it is to a desolate <lb/>
            country, in which he wandered about for a long time without <lb/>
            being discontented at his wandering and at his unsettled condi­ <lb/>
            tion, which necessarily arose from it. And yet, what other man <lb/>
            would not have been grieved, not only at departing from his own <lb/>
            country but also at being driven away from every city into an <lb/>
            inaccessible and impassable district ? And what other man would <lb/>
            not have turned back and returned to his former home, paying <lb/>
            but little attention to his former hopes, but desiring to escape <lb/>
            from his present perplexity, thinking it folly for the sake of <lb/>
            uncertain advantages to undergo admitted evils?- But this <lb/>
            man alone appears to have behaved in the contrary manner, <lb/>
            thinking that life which was remote from the fellowship of <lb/>
            many companions the most pleasant of all.</p>
          <p>And this is naturally the case; for those who seek and <lb/>
            desire to find God, love that solitude which is dear to him, <lb/>
            labouring for this as their dearest and primary object, to <lb/>
            become like his blessed and happy nature. Therefore, having <lb/>
            now given both explanations, the literal one as concerning the <lb/>
            man, and the allegorical one relating to the soul, we have <lb/>
            shown that both the man and the mind are deserving of love ; <lb/>
            inasmuch as the one is obedient to the sacred oracles, and <lb/>
            because of their influence submits to be torn away from things <lb/>
            with which it is hard to part; and the mind deserves to be <lb/>
            loved because it has not submitted to be for ever deceived and <lb/>
            to abide permanently with the essences perceptible by the out­ <lb/>
            ward senses, thinking the visible world the greatest and first <lb/>
            of gods, but soaring upwards with its reason it has beheld <lb/>
            another nature better than that which is visible, that, namely, <lb/>
            which is appreciable only by the intellect; and also that being <lb/>
            who is at the same time the Creator and ruler of both.</p>
          <p>XIX. These, then, are the first principles of the man who <lb/>
            loves God, and they are followed by actions which do not <lb/>
            deserve to be lightly esteemed. But the greatness of them is <lb/>
            not evident to every one, but only to those who have tasted of <lb/>
             <pb n="415"/>
            virtue, and who are wont to look with ridicule upon the objects <lb/>
            which are admired by the multitude, by reason of the great­ <lb/>
            ness of the good things of the soul. Therefore, God, having <lb/>
            approved of his conduct which I have mentioned, presently <lb/>
            rewarded the virtuous man with a great gift, inasmuch as he <lb/>
            preserved sound and free from all pollution his marriage, <lb/>
            which was in danger of being plotted against by a powerful and <lb/>
            incontinent man.</p>
          <p>And the cause of this man's design upon it arose from this <lb/>
            beginning; there having been a barrenness and scarcity of <lb/>
            crops for a long time, owing to a long and immoderate period <lb/>
            of rain which prevailed at one time, and to a great drought <lb/>
            and heat which ensued afterwards. The cities of Syria being <lb/>
            oppressed by a long continuance of famine, became destitute <lb/>
            of inhabitants, all of them being dispersed in different direc­ <lb/>
            tions for the purpose of seeking food and providing themselves <lb/>
            with necessaries. Therefore, Abraham, hearing that there <lb/>
            was unlimited abundance and plenty in Egypt, since the river <lb/>
            there irrigated the fields with its inundations at the proper <lb/>
            season, and since the winds by their salutary temperature <lb/>
            brought up and nourished rich and heavy crops of corn, rose <lb/>
            up with all his household to quit Syria and to go thither. And <lb/>
            he had a wife of a most excellent disposition, who was also the <lb/>
            most beautiful of all the women of her time. The Egyptian <lb/>
            magistrates, seeing her and admiring her exquisite form, for <lb/>
            nothing ever escapes the notice of men in authority, gave <lb/>
            information to the king. And the king, sending for the woman <lb/>
            and beholding her extraordinary beauty, gave but little heed <lb/>
            to the dictates of modesty or to the laws which had been <lb/>
            established with respect to the honour due to strangers, but <lb/>
            yielding to his incontinent desires, conceived the intention in <lb/>
            name, indeed, to marry her in lawful wedlock, but, in fact to <lb/>
            seduce and defile her. But she, being destitute of all succour, <lb/>
            as being in a foreign land, before an incontinent and cruel- <lb/>
            minded ruler (for her husband had no power to protect her, <lb/>
            fearing the danger which impended over him from princes <lb/>
            mightier than he), at last, with him, took refuge in the only <lb/>
            alliance remaining to her, the protection of God.</p>
          <p>And the merciful and gracious God, who takes compassion <lb/>
            on the stranger, and who fights on behalf of those who are <lb/>
            unjustly oppressed, inflicted in a moment painful sufferings and <lb/>
             <pb n="416"/>
            terrible chastisements on the king, filling his body and soul <lb/>
            with all kinds of miseries difficult to be escaped or remedied, <lb/>
            so that all his inclinations tending to pleasure were cut short, <lb/>
            and, ou the contrary, he was occupied with nothing but <lb/>
            cares, seeking an alleviation from his endless and intolerable <lb/>
            torments by which he was harassed and tortured day and <lb/>
            night; and his whole household also received their share of <lb/>
            his punishment, because none of them had felt any iudigna­ <lb/>
            tion at his lawless conduct, but had all consented to it, and <lb/>
            had all but co-operated actively in his iniquity.</p>
          <p>In this manner the chastity of the woman was preserved, <lb/>
            and God condescended to display the excellence and piety <lb/>
            of her husband, giving him the noblest reward, namely, his <lb/>
            marriage free from all injury, and even from all insult, so as <lb/>
            no longer to be in danger of being violated; a marriage <lb/>
            which however was not intended to produce any limited <lb/>
            number of sons and daughters, but an entire nation-the <lb/>
            most God-loving of all nations- and one which appears to <lb/>
            me to have received the offices of priesthood and prophecy <lb/>
            on behalf of the whole human race.</p>
          <p>XX. I have heard men versed in natural philosophy in­ <lb/>
            terpreting this passage in an allegorical manner with no <lb/>
            inconsiderable ingenuity and propriety; and their idea is, <lb/>
            that the man here is a symbolical expression for the virtuous <lb/>
            mind, conjecturing from the interpretation of his name that <lb/>
            what is intended to be indicated is the virtuous disposition <lb/>
            existing in the soul; and that by his wife is meant virtue, <lb/>
            for the name of his wife is, in the Chaldæan language, <lb/>
            Sarah, but in Greek " priucess," because there is nothing <lb/>
            more royal or more worthy of pre-eminence than virtue. <lb/>
            And the marriage in which pleasure unites people compre­ <lb/>
            bends the connection of the bodies, but that which is <lb/>
            brought about by wisdom is the union of reasonings which <lb/>
            desire purification, and of the perfect virtues ; and the two <lb/>
            kinds of marriage here described are extremely opposite to <lb/>
            one another; for in the marriage of the bodies it is the <lb/>
            male partner which sows the seed and the female which <lb/>
            receives it, but in the union which takes place with regard <lb/>
            to the soul it is quite the contrary, and it is virtue which <lb/>
            appears to be there in the place of the woman, which sows <lb/>
            good counsels, and virtuous speeches, and expositions of <lb/>
             <pb n="417"/>
            doctrines profitable to life ; but the reason which is con­ <lb/>
            sidered to be classed in the light of the man receives the <lb/>
            sacred and divine seed, unless, indeed, there is any error in <lb/>
            the names usually given; for certainly, in the grammatical <lb/>
            view of the words, the word reason is masculine, and the <lb/>
            word virtue has a feminine character.</p>
          <p>But if, any one, discarding the considerations of the <lb/>
            names which tend to throw darkness over the subject, <lb/>
            chooses to look at the plain facts without any disguise, he <lb/>
            will know that virtue is masculine by nature, inasmuch as <lb/>
            it puts things in motion, and arranges them, and suggests <lb/>
            good conceptions of noble actions and speeches ; but reason <lb/>
            is feminine, inasmuch as it is put in motion by another, and <lb/>
            is instructed and benefited, and, in short, is altogether the <lb/>
            patient, as its passive state is its only safety.</p>
          <p>XXI. All men, therefore, even the most vile, in word <lb/>
            honour and admire virtue as far as appearance goes ; but it <lb/>
            is the virtuous alone who obey its injunctions; on which <lb/>
            account the king of Egypt, who is a figurative representa­ <lb/>
            tion of the mind devoted to the body, as if he were acting <lb/>
            in a theatre, assumes the character of a pretended partici­ <lb/>
            pation in temperance though being an intemperate man, and <lb/>
            in continence though being an incontinent man, and in justice <lb/>
            though an unjust man, and he invites justice to himself, <lb/>
            being eager to obtain a good report from the multitude ; <lb/>
            and the governor of the universe seeing this, for God alone <lb/>
            has power to look into the soul, hates him and rejects him, <lb/>
            and by the most cruel tests and powers convicts him of an <lb/>
            utterly false disposition.</p>
          <p>But by what instruments are these tests carried out ? <lb/>
            Surely altogether by the parts of virtue which, whenever <lb/>
            they enter, inflict great pain and severe wounds; for a <lb/>
            torture is a deficiency of supply to that which is insatiable, <lb/>
            and the torture of greediness is temperance; moreover, the <lb/>
            man who is fond of glory is tortured while simplicity and <lb/>
            humility are in the ascendent, and so is the unjust man <lb/>
            when justice is extolled ; for it is impossible for two hostile <lb/>
            natures to inhabit one soul, namely, for wickedness and <lb/>
            virtue, for which reason, when they do come together, end­ <lb/>
            less and irreconcilable seditions and wars are kindled <lb/>
            between them ; and yet this is the case though virtue is of' <note type="footnote"> VOL. II. </note> <note type="footnote"> E E </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="418"/>
            a most peaceful disposition, and, as they say, is anxious <lb/>
            whenever it is about to come to a contest of strength to <lb/>
            make trial of its own powers first, so as only to contend if <lb/>
            it has a prospect of being able to gain the victory; but if <lb/>
            it finds its power unequal to the conflict, then it will never <lb/>
            dare to descend into the arena at all, for it is not disgraceful <lb/>
            to wickedness to be defeated, inasmuch as ingloriousness is <lb/>
            akin to it; but it would be a shameful thing for virtue, to <lb/>
            which glory is the most appropriate and the most peculiarly <lb/>
            belonging of all things, on which account it is natural for <lb/>
            virtue either to secure the victory, or else to keep itself un­ <lb/>
            conquered.</p>
          <p>XXII. It has been said then that the disposition of the <lb/>
            Egyptians is inhospitable and intemperate; and the human­ <lb/>
            ity of him who has been exposed to their conduct deserves <lb/>
            admiration, for he* in the middle of the day beholding as it <lb/>
            were three men travelling (and he did not perceive that <lb/>
            they were in reality of a more divine nature), ran up and <lb/>
            entreated them with great perseverance not to pass by his <lb/>
            tent, but as was becoming to go in and receive the rites of <lb/>
            hospitality: and they knowing the truth of the man not so <lb/>
            much by what he said, as by his mind which they could look <lb/>
            into, assented to his request without hesitation; and being <lb/>
            filled as to his soul with joy, he took every possible pains to <lb/>
            make their extemporaneous reception worthy of them ; and <lb/>
            he said to his wife, " Hasten now, and make ready quickly <lb/>
            three measures of fine meal," and he himself went forth <lb/>
            among the herds of oxen, and brought forth a tender and <lb/>
            well-fed heifer, and gave it to his servant; and he having <lb/>
            slain it, dressed it with all speed.</p>
          <p>For no one in the house of a wise man is ever slow to <lb/>
            perform the duties of hospitality, but both women and men, <lb/>
            and slaves and freemen, are most eager in the performance <lb/>
            of all those duties towards strangers ; therefore, after having <lb/>
            feasted, and being delighted, not so much with what was set <lb/>
            before them, as with the good will of their entertainer, and <lb/>
            with his excessive and unbounded zeal to please them, <lb/>
            they bestow on him a reward beyond his expectation, the <lb/>
            birth of a legitimate son in a short time, making him a <lb/>
            promise which is to be confirmed to him by one the most <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xviii. 1, &amp;c. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="419"/>
            excellent of the three ; for it would have been inconsistent <lb/>
            with philosophy for them all to speak together at the same <lb/>
            moment, but it was desirous for all the rest to assent while <lb/>
            one spoke.</p>
          <p>Nevertheless he did not completely believe them even <lb/>
            when they made him this promise, by reason of the incredi­ <lb/>
            ble nature of the thing promised; for both he and his wife, <lb/>
            through extreme old age, were so old as utterly to have <lb/>
            abandoned all hope of offspring; therefore the scriptures <lb/>
            record that Abraham's wife, when she first heard what <lb/>
            they were saying, laughed; and when they said after­ <lb/>
            wards, " Is anything impossible to God?" they were so <lb/>
            ashamed that they denied that they had laughed; for <lb/>
            Abraham knew that everything was possible to God, having <lb/>
            almost learnt this doctrine as one may say from his cradle ; <lb/>
            then for the first time he appears to me to have begun to <lb/>
            entertain a different opinion of his guests from that which <lb/>
            he conceived at first, and to have imagined that they were <lb/>
            either some of the prophets or of the angels who had <lb/>
            changed their spiritual and soul-like essence, and assumed <lb/>
            the appearance of men.</p>
          <p>XXIII. We have now then described the hospitable <lb/>
            temper of the man, which was as it were a sort of addition <lb/>
            to set off his greater virtue; but his virtue was piety <lb/>
            towards God, concerning which we have spoken before, <lb/>
            the most evident instance of which is to be found in his <lb/>
            conduct now recorded towards the strangers ; but if any per­ <lb/>
            sons have fancied that house happy and blessed in which it <lb/>
            has happened that wise men have stopped and abode, they <lb/>
            should consider that they would not have done so, and <lb/>
            would not even have looked into it at all, if they had seen <lb/>
            any incurable disease in the souls of those who were therein, <lb/>
            but I know not what excess of happiness and blessedness, I <lb/>
            should say, existed in that house in which angels conde­ <lb/>
            scended to tarry and to receive the rites of hospitality from <lb/>
            men, angels, those sacred and divine natures, the ministers <lb/>
            and lieutenants of the mighty God, by means of whom, as <lb/>
            of ambassadors, he announces whatever predictions he con­ <lb/>
            descends to intimate to our race.</p>
          <p>For how could they ever have endured to enter a human <lb/>
            habitation at all, unless they had been certain that all the <note type="footnote">E E 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="420"/>
            inhabitants within, like the well-managed and orderly crew <lb/>
            of a ship, obeyed one signal only, namely, that of their <lb/>
            master, as the sailors obey the command of the captain ? <lb/>
            And how would they ever have condescended to assume the <lb/>
            appearance of guests and men feasted hospitably, if they <lb/>
            had not thought that their entertainer was akin to them, <lb/>
            and a fellow servant with them, bound to the service of the <lb/>
            same master as themselves ? We must think indeed that <lb/>
            at their entrance all the parts of the house became improved <lb/>
            and advanced in goodness, being breathed upon with a <lb/>
            certain breeze of most perfect virtue.</p>
          <p>And the entertainment was such as it was fitting that it <lb/>
            should be, the persons who were being feasted displaying at <lb/>
            the banquet their own simplicity towards their entertainer, <lb/>
            and addressing him in a guileless manner, and all of them <lb/>
            holding conversation suited to the occasion. And it is a <lb/>
            thing that deserves to be looked on as a prodigy, that <lb/>
            though they did not drink they seemed to drink, and that <lb/>
            though they did not eat they presented the appearance of <lb/>
            persons eating. But this was all natural and consistent <lb/>
            with what was going on. And the most miraculous circum­ <lb/>
            stance of all was, that these beings who were incorporeal. <lb/>
            presented the appearance of a body in human form by <lb/>
            reason of their favour to the virtuous man, for otherwise <lb/>
            what need was there of all these miracles except for the <lb/>
            purpose of giving the wise man the evidence of his external <lb/>
            senses by means of a more distinct sight, because his cha­ <lb/>
            racter had not escaped the knowledge of the Father of the <lb/>
            universe.</p>
          <p>XXIV. This then is sufficient to say by way of a literal <lb/>
            explanation of this account: we must now speak of that <lb/>
            which may be given if the story be looked at as figurative <lb/>
            and symbolical.</p>
          <p>The things which are expressed by the voice are the signs <lb/>
            of those things which are conceived in the mind alone; <lb/>
            when, therefore, the soul is shone upon by God as if at <lb/>
            noonday, and when it is wholly and entirely filled with that <lb/>
            light which is appreciable only by the intellect, and by <lb/>
            being wholly surrounded with its brilliancy is free from all <lb/>
            shade or darkness, it then perceives a threefold image of <lb/>
            one subject, one image of the living God, and others of the <lb/>
             <pb n="421"/>
            . other two, as if they were shadows irradiated by it. And <lb/>
            some such thing as this happens to those who dwell in that <lb/>
            light which is perceptible by the outward senses, for whether <lb/>
            people are standing still or in motion, there is often a double <lb/>
            shadow failing from them.</p>
          <p>Let not any one then fancy that the word shadow is <lb/>
            applied to God with perfect propriety. It is merely a cata­ <lb/>
            chrestical abuse of the name, by way of bringing before <lb/>
            our eyes a more vivid representation of the matter intended <lb/>
            to be intimated. Since this is not the actual truth, but in <lb/>
            order that one may when speaking keep as close to the <lb/>
            truth as possible, the one in the middle is the Father of the <lb/>
            universe, who in the sacred scriptures is called by his proper <lb/>
            name, I am that I am ; and the beings on each side are those <lb/>
            most ancient powers which are always close to the living <lb/>
            God, one of which is called his creative power, and the <lb/>
            other his royal power.</p>
          <p>And the creative power is God, for it is by this that be <lb/>
            made and arranged the universe ; and the royal power is <lb/>
            the Lord, for it is fitting that the Creator should lord it <lb/>
            over and govern the creature. Therefore the middle person <lb/>
            of the three, being attended by each of his powers as by <lb/>
            body-guards, presents to the mind, which is endowed with <lb/>
            the faculty of sight, a vision at one time of one being, and <lb/>
            at another time of three; of one when the soul being com­ <lb/>
            pletely purified, and having surmounted not only the multi­ <lb/>
            tudes of numbers, but also the number two, which is the <lb/>
            neighbour of the unit, hastens onward to that idea which is <lb/>
            devoid of all mixture, free from all combination, and by <lb/>
            itself in need of nothing else whatever; and of three, <lb/>
            when, not being as yet made perfect as to the important <lb/>
            virtues, it is still seeking for initiation in those of less con­ <lb/>
            sequence, and is not able to attain to a comprehension of <lb/>
            the living God by its own unassisted faculties without the <lb/>
            aid of something else, but can only do so by judging of his <lb/>
            deeds, whether as creator or as governor. This then, as <lb/>
            they say, is the second best thing; and it no less partakes <lb/>
            in the opinion which is dear to and devoted to God. But <lb/>
            the first-mentioned disposition has no such share, but is <lb/>
            itself the very God-loving and God-beloved opinion itself, <lb/>
             <pb n="422"/>
            or rather it is truth which is older than opinion, and more <lb/>
            valuable than any seeming.</p>
          <p>But we must now explain what is intimated by this <lb/>
            statement in a more perspicuous manner.</p>
          <p>XXV. There are three different classes of human dispo­ <lb/>
            sitions, each of which has received as its portion one of the <lb/>
            aforesaid visions. The best of them has received that vision <lb/>
            which is in the centre, the sight of the truly living God. <lb/>
            The one which is next best has received that which is on <lb/>
            the right hand, the sight of the beneficent power which has <lb/>
            the name of God. And the third has the sight of that <lb/>
            which is on the left hand, the governing power, which is <lb/>
            called lord. Therefore, the best dispositions cultivate that <lb/>
            being who exists of himself, without the aid of any one <lb/>
            else, being themselves attracted by nothing else, by reason <lb/>
            of all their entire attention being directed to the honour of <lb/>
            that one being. But of the other dispositions, some derive <lb/>
            their existence and owe their being recognized by the father <lb/>
            to his beneficent power; and others, again, owe it to his <lb/>
            governing power. My meaning in this statement is this :—</p>
          <p>Men when they perceive that, under the pretext of friend­ <lb/>
            ship, some persons come to them, being in reality only <lb/>
            desirous to get what they can from them, look upon them <lb/>
            with suspicion, and turn away from them, fearing their <lb/>
            insincere, and flattering, and caressing behaviour, as very <lb/>
            pernicious. But God, inasmuch as he is not liable to any <lb/>
            injury, gladly invites all men who choose, in any way what­ <lb/>
            ever to honour him, to come unto him, not choosing alto­ <lb/>
            gether to reject any person whatever; and, in truth, he <lb/>
            almost says in express words to those who have ears in the <lb/>
            soul, " The most valuable prizes shall be offered to those who <lb/>
            worship me for my own sake: the second best to those <lb/>
            who hope by their own efforts to be able to attain to good, <lb/>
            or to find a means of escape from punishments. For oven <lb/>
            if the service of this latter class is mercenary and not <lb/>
            wholly incorrupt, still it nevertheless revolves within the <lb/>
            divine circumference, and does not stray beyond it. But <lb/>
            the rewards which shall be laid up for those who honour <lb/>
            me for my own sake are rewards of affection; while those <lb/>
            which are given to those who do so with a view to their <lb/>
             <pb n="423"/>
            own advantage are not given through affection, but because <lb/>
            they are not looked upon as aliens. For I receive him who <lb/>
            wishes to be a partaker of my beneficent power to a partici­ <lb/>
            pation in my good things, and him who out of fear seeks to <lb/>
            propitiate my governing and despotic power, I receive so far <lb/>
            as to avert punishment from him. For I am not unaware <lb/>
            that, in addition to these men not becoming worse, thev <lb/>
            will become better, by gradually arriving at a sincere and <lb/>
            pure piety by their constant perseverance in serving me. <lb/>
            For even if the original dispositions, under the influence of <lb/>
            which they originally endeavoured to please me, differ widely, <lb/>
            still they must not be blamed, because they have in conse­ <lb/>
            quence only one aim and object, that of serving me."</p>
          <p>But that what is seen is in reality a threefold appearance <lb/>
            of one subject is plain, not only from the contemplation of <lb/>
            the allegory, but also from that of the express words in <lb/>
            which the allegory is couched. For when the wise man <lb/>
            entreats those persons who are in the guise of three travel­ <lb/>
            lers to come and lodge in his house, he speaks to them not <lb/>
            as three persons, but as one, and says, " My lord, if I have <lb/>
            found favour with thee, do not thou pass by thy servant."* <lb/>
            For the expressions, " my lord," and " with thee," and " do <lb/>
            not thou pass by," and others of the same kind, are all such <lb/>
            as are naturally addressed to a single individual, but not to <lb/>
            many. And when those persons, having been entertained <lb/>
            in his house, address their entertainer in an affectionate <lb/>
            manner, it is again one of them who promises that he by <lb/>
            himself will be present, and will bestow on him the seed of <lb/>
            a child of his own, speaking in the following words : “ I <lb/>
            will return again and visit thee again, according to the time <lb/>
            of life, and Sarah thy wife shall have a son.”†</p>
          <p>XXVI. And what is signified by this is indicated in a <lb/>
            most evident and careful manner by the events which <lb/>
            ensued. The country of the Sodomites was a district of the <lb/>
            land of Canaan, which the Syrians afterwards called Pales­ <lb/>
            tine, a country full of innumerable iniquities, and espe­ <lb/>
            cially of gluttony and debauchery, and all the great and <lb/>
            numerous pleasures of other kinds which have been built <lb/>
            up by men as a fortress, on which account it had been <lb/>
            already condemned by the Judge of the whole world. And <note type="footnote"> <unclear/>* Genesis xviii. 3. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Genesis xviii. 10. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="424"/>
            the cause of its excessive and immoderate intemperance was <lb/>
            the unlimited abundance of supplies of all kinds which its <lb/>
            inhabitants enjoyed. For the land was one with a deep <lb/>
            soil, and well watered, and as such produced abundant crops <lb/>
            of every kind of fruit every year. And he was a wise man <lb/>
            and spoke truly who said- <lb/>
            The greatest cause of all iniquity <lb/>
            Is found in overmuch prosperity."</p>
          <p>As men, being unable to bear discreetly a satiety of these <lb/>
            things, get restive like cattle, and become stiff-necked, and <lb/>
            discard the laws of nature, pursuing a great and intem­ <lb/>
            perate indulgence of gluttony, and drinking, and unlawful <lb/>
            connections; for not only did they go mad after women, <lb/>
            and defile the marriage bed of others, but also those who <lb/>
            were men lusted after one another, doing unseemly things, <lb/>
            and not regarding or respecting their common nature, and <lb/>
            though eager for children, they were convicted by having <lb/>
            only an abortive offspring ; but the conviction produced no <lb/>
            advantage, since they were overcome by violent desire; and <lb/>
            so, by degrees, the men became accustomed to be treated <lb/>
            like women, and in this way engendered among themselves <lb/>
            the disease of females, an intolerable evil; for they not only, <lb/>
            as to effeminacy and delicacy, became like women in their <lb/>
            persons, but they made also their souls most ignoble, cor­ <lb/>
            rupting in this way the whole race of man, as far as <lb/>
            depended on them. At all events, if the Greeks and barba­ <lb/>
            rians were to have agreed together, and to have adopted the <lb/>
            commerce of the citizens of this city, their cities one after <lb/>
            another would have become desolate, as if they had been <lb/>
            emptied by a pestilence.</p>
          <p>XXVII. But God, having taken pity on mankind, as <lb/>
            being a Saviour and full of love for mankind, increased, as <lb/>
            far as possible, the natural desire of men and women for a <lb/>
            connexion together, for the sake of producing children, and <lb/>
            detesting the unnatural and unlawful commerce of the <lb/>
            people of Sodom, he extinguished it, and destroyed those <lb/>
            who were inclined to these things, and that not by any or­ <lb/>
            dinary chastisement, but he inflicted on them an astonish­ <lb/>
            in, novelty, and unheard of rarity of vengeance; for, on a <lb/>
            sudden, he commanded the sky to become overclouded and <lb/>
             <pb n="425"/>
            to pour forth a mighty shower, not of rain but of fire ; and <lb/>
            as the flame poured down, with a resistless and unceasing <lb/>
            violence, the fields were burnt up, and the meadows, and <lb/>
            all the dense groves, and the thick marshes, and the impe­ <lb/>
            netrable thickets; the plain too was consumed, and all the <lb/>
            crop of wheat, and of everything else that was sown; and <lb/>
            all the trees of the mountain district were burnt up, the <lb/>
            trunks and the very roots being consumed.</p>
          <p>And the folds for the cattle, and the houses of the men, <lb/>
            and the walls, and all that was in any building, whether <lb/>
            of private or public property, were all burnt. And in one <lb/>
            day these populous cities became the tomb of their in­ <lb/>
            habitants, and the vast edifices of stone and timber became <lb/>
            thin dust and ashes. And when the flames had consumed <lb/>
            everything that was visible and that existed on the face of <lb/>
            the earth, they proceeded to burn even the earth itself, pone­ <lb/>
            trating into its lowest recesses, and destroying all the <lb/>
            vivifying powers which existed within it so as to produce a <lb/>
            complete and everlasting barrenness, so that it should never <lb/>
            again be able to bear fruit, or to put forth any verdure ; and <lb/>
            to this very day it is scorched up. For the fire of the <lb/>
            lightning is what is most difficult to extinguish, and creeps <lb/>
            on pervading everything, and smouldering.</p>
          <p>And a most evident proof of this is to be found in what <lb/>
            is seen to this day: for the smoke which is still emitted, <lb/>
            and the sulphur which men dig up there, are a proof of the <lb/>
            calamity which befell that country; while a most con­ <lb/>
            spicuous proof of the ancient fertility of the land is left in <lb/>
            one city, and in the land around it. For the city is very <lb/>
            populous, and the land is fertile in grass and in corn, and in <lb/>
            every kind of fruit, as a constant evidence of the punish­ <lb/>
            ment which was inflicted by the divine will on the rest of <lb/>
            the country.</p>
          <p>XXVIII. But I have not gone through all these par­ <lb/>
            ticulars for the sake of showing the magnitude of that <lb/>
            vast and novel calamity, but because I desired to prove that <lb/>
            of the three beings who appeared to the wise Abraham in <lb/>
            the guise of men, the scriptures only represent two as <lb/>
            having come to the country which was subsequently de­ <lb/>
            stroyed for the purpose of destroying its inhabitants, since <lb/>
            the third did not think fit to come for that purpose. Inas­ <lb/>
             <pb n="426"/>
            much as lie, according to my conception, was the true and <lb/>
            living God, who thought it fitting that lie being present <lb/>
            should bestow good gifts by his own power, but that he <lb/>
            should effect the opposite objects by the agency and service of <lb/>
            his subordinate powers, so that he might be looked upon as <lb/>
            the cause of good only, and of no evil whatever antecedently.</p>
          <p>And kings too appear to me to imitate the divine nature <lb/>
            in this particular, and to act in the same way, giving their <lb/>
            favours in person, but inflicting their chastisements by the <lb/>
            agency of others. But since, of the two powers of God, <lb/>
            one is a beneficent power and the other a chastising one, <lb/>
            each of them, as is natural, is manifested to the country of <lb/>
            the people of Sodom. Because of the five finest cities in it <lb/>
            four were about to be destroyed by fire, and one was des­ <lb/>
            tined to be left unhurt and safe from every evil. For it was <lb/>
            necessary that the calamities should be inflicted by the <lb/>
            chastising power, and that the one which was to be saved <lb/>
            should be saved by the beneficent power. But since the <lb/>
            portion which was saved was not endowed with entire and <lb/>
            complete virtues, but was blessed with kindness by the <lb/>
            power of the living God, it was deliberately accounted un­ <lb/>
            worthy to have a sight of his presence afforded to it.</p>
          <p>XXIX. This, then, is the open explanation which is to <lb/>
            be given of this account, and which is to be addressed to <lb/>
            the multitude. But there is another esoteric explanation <lb/>
            to be reserved for the few who choose for the subjects of <lb/>
            their investigation the dispositions of the soul, and not the <lb/>
            forms of bodies ; and this shall now be mentioned.</p>
          <p>The five cities of the land of Sodom are a figurative repre­ <lb/>
            sentation of the five outward senses which exist in us, the <lb/>
            organs of the pleasures, by the instrumentality of which all the <lb/>
            pleasures whether great or small are brought to perfection; <lb/>
            for we are pleased either when we behold the varieties of <lb/>
            colours and forms, both in things inanimate and in those <lb/>
            endowed with vitality, or when we hear melodious sounds, <lb/>
            or again, we are delighted by the exercise of the faculty <lb/>
            of taste in the things which relate to eating and drinking, <lb/>
            or by that of the sense of smell in fragrant flavours and <lb/>
            vapours, or in accordance with our faculty of touch when <lb/>
            conversant with soft, or hot, or smooth things.</p>
          <p>Now of these five outward senses there are three which have <lb/>
             <pb n="427"/>
            the greatest resemblance to the brute beasts and to slaves, <lb/>
            namely the senses of taste, smell, and touch: as it is with <lb/>
            reference to these that those species of beasts and cattle <lb/>
            which arc the most greedy and the most strongly inclined <lb/>
            to sexual connections are the most vehemently excited. For <lb/>
            all day and all night they are either glutting themselves in­ <lb/>
            satiably with food, or else in a state of eagerness for sexual <lb/>
            connection. But there are two of these outward senses <lb/>
            which have something philosophical and pre-eminent in <lb/>
            them, namely, sight and hearing. But the ears are in some <lb/>
            degree more slow and more effeminate than the eyes, <lb/>
            since the latter go with promptness and courage to what is <lb/>
            to be seen, and do not wait until the objects themselves <lb/>
            are in motion, but go forward to meet them, and desire <lb/>
            to move themselves so as to face them.</p>
          <p>But the sense of hearing, inasmuch as that is slow and <lb/>
            more effeminate, may be classed in the second rank, and the <lb/>
            sense of seeing may be allowed an especial pre-eminence <lb/>
            and privilege: for God has made this sense a sort of rqueen <lb/>
            of the rest, placing it above them all, and stationing it as it <lb/>
            were on a citadel, has made it of all the senses in the closest <lb/>
            connection with the soul; and any one may conjecture this <lb/>
            from the common changes which take place in its essential <lb/>
            organs; for when grief exists in the soul of man, the eyes <lb/>
            are full of concern and melancholy; and on the other hand, <lb/>
            when joy is in our heart the eyes smile and rejoice; and <lb/>
            when fear gets the upper hand they are full of turbulent <lb/>
            and disorderly confusion, and are subject to all kinds or <lb/>
            irregular motions, and quiverings, and distortions.</p>
          <p>Again, if anger occupies us, the sight becomes more fierce <lb/>
            and bloodshot; and when we are considerating or deliberat­ <lb/>
            ing, the eyes are tranquil and motionless, and almost as <lb/>
            intent as the mind itself; just as at moments of the relaxa­ <lb/>
            tion and indifference of the mind, the eyes also are relaxed and <lb/>
            indifferent; when a friend approaches the feeling of good- <lb/>
            will towards him is proclaimed by a calm and serene look ; <lb/>
            on the other hand, if we meet with an enemy, the eyes give <lb/>
            an early indication of the displeasure of the soul; when our <lb/>
            mind is inspired by boldness, our eyes bound forward and <lb/>
            are ready to start from our heads; when we are oppressed <lb/>
             <pb n="428"/>
            with feelings of shame or modesty, they are gentle and <lb/>
            repressed.</p>
          <p>And, in short, we may say that the sight has been created <lb/>
            to be an exact image of the soul, which is thus beautifully <lb/>
            represented by it through the perfection of the Creator's <lb/>
            skill, the eyes showing a visible representation of it, as in a <lb/>
            mirror, since the soul has no visible nature in itself; but it <lb/>
            is not in this particular alone that the beauty of the eyes <lb/>
            exceeds the rest of the outward senses, but also because the <lb/>
            use of the other senses is interrupted during our waking <lb/>
            moments; for we must not include in our statement the <lb/>
            inactivity which results from sleep; for they are at rest <lb/>
            whenever there is not some external object to put them <lb/>
            in motion; but the energies of the eyes when they are open <lb/>
            are continuous and uninterrupted, as the eyes are never sati­ <lb/>
            ated or wearied, but continue to operate in accordance with <lb/>
            the connection which they have with the soul; and the soul <lb/>
            itself is everlastingly awake, and is in perpetual motion <lb/>
            both night and day; but to the eyes, as being to a great <lb/>
            degree partakers of the fleshly nature, a self sufficient gift <lb/>
            was given, to be able to continue exercising their appro­ <lb/>
            priate energies during one half of the entire period of life.</p>
          <p>XXX. But we must now proceed to speak of that which <lb/>
            is the most necessary part of all, the advantage which we <lb/>
            derive from the eyes. For it is to sight alone of the exter­ <lb/>
            nal senses that God has caused light to arise, which is both <lb/>
            the most beautiful of all existing things, and is, moreover, <lb/>
            the first thing which is pronounced in the sacred scriptures <lb/>
            to be good. Now the nature of light is twofold : for there <lb/>
            is one light which proceeds from the fire which we use, a <lb/>
            perishable light proceeding from a perishable material, and <lb/>
            one which admits of being extinguished. But the other <lb/>
            kind is inextinguishable and imperishable, descending to us <lb/>
            from above from heaven, as if every one of the stars was <lb/>
            pouring down its beams upon us from an everlasting <lb/>
            spring. And the sense of sight associates with each of <lb/>
            these kinds of light, and through the medium of both of <lb/>
            them does it approach the objects of sight so as to arrive at <lb/>
            a most accurate comprehension of them. Why now need <lb/>
            we attempt to panegyrize the eyes further by a speech, <lb/>
             <pb n="429"/>
            when God has engraved their true praises on pillars erected <lb/>
            in heaven, namely, the stars ? For for what purpose were <lb/>
            the rays of the sun, and the beams of the moon, and the <lb/>
            light of all the other planets and fixed stars called into <lb/>
            existence, except as fields for the energies of the eyes in <lb/>
            their service of seeing ? On which account men, using the <lb/>
            most excellent of all gifts, contemplate the things which <lb/>
            exist in the world, the earth, the plants, the animals, the <lb/>
            fruits of the earth, the seas, the effusion of waters springing <lb/>
            from the earth and gushing forth in torrents and floods, <lb/>
            and the varieties of fountains, some of which give forth cold <lb/>
            and others hot water, and the natures of all things that <lb/>
            exist in the air; and all the different species, of which we <lb/>
            thus arrive at the knowlege, are innumerable and indescrib­ <lb/>
            able, and cannot be comprised in speech. And above <lb/>
            all these things, the eyes can behold the heaven, which is <lb/>
            truly a world created in another world, and it can also sur­ <lb/>
            vey the beauties and divine images existing in heaven. <lb/>
            Which now of the other external senses can boast that it has <lb/>
            arrived at such a pitch of power as this ?</p>
          <p>XXXI. But now, dismissing the consideration of those <lb/>
            of the outward senses which are in the stables, as it were, <lb/>
            fattening up an animal which is born with us, namely, <lb/>
            appetite, let us investigate the nature of that sense which <lb/>
            receives speech, namely, hearing; the continued and vigo­ <lb/>
            rous, and most perfect course of which exists in the atmo­ <lb/>
            sphere which surrounds the earth, when the violence of the <lb/>
            winds and the noise of thunder sound with a great dragging <lb/>
            noise and terrible crash. But the eyes in a single moment <lb/>
            can reach from earth to heaven, and taking in the extremest <lb/>
            boundaries of the universe, reaching at the same moment to <lb/>
            the east and to the west, and to the north and to the south, <lb/>
            so as to survey them all at once, drag the mind towards <lb/>
            what is visible. And the mind, at once receiving a similar <lb/>
            impression, does not continue quiet, but being in perpetual <lb/>
            motion, and never slumbering, receiving from the sight the <lb/>
            power of observing the objects appreciable by the intellect, <lb/>
            comes to consider whether these things which are brought <lb/>
            visibly before it are uncreated, or whether they have derived <lb/>
            their origin from creation ; also, whether they are bounded <lb/>
            or infinite. Again, whether there are many worlds or only <lb/>
             <pb n="430"/>
            one; also, whether there are five elements of the whole <lb/>
            universe, or whether heaven and the heavenly bodies have a <lb/>
            peculiar and separate nature of their own, having received <lb/>
            a more divine conformation, differing from that of the rest <lb/>
            of the world.</p>
          <p>Again, by these means it considers if the world has been <lb/>
            created, by whom it has been created, and who the creator <lb/>
            is as to his essence or quality, and with what design he <lb/>
            made it, and what he is doing now, and what his mode of <lb/>
            existence or cause of life is; and all other such questions as <lb/>
            the excellently-endowed mind when cohabiting with wisdom <lb/>
            is accustomed to examine.</p>
          <p>These, and similar subjects, belong to philosophers, from <lb/>
            which it is plain that wisdom and philosophy have not derived <lb/>
            their origin from anything else that exists in us except from <lb/>
            that queen of the outward senses, the sight, which God saved <lb/>
            alone of the region of the body when he destroyed the other <lb/>
            four, because these last were slaves to the flesh and to the <lb/>
            passions of the flesh; but the sight alone was able to raise <lb/>
            its head and to look up, and to find other sources of delight <lb/>
            far superior to those proceeding from the bodily pleasures, <lb/>
            those, namely, that are derived from the contemplation of <lb/>
            the world and the things in it. Therefore it was appro­ <lb/>
            priate for one of the five outward senses, namely, the sight, <lb/>
            like one eity in the Pentapolis, to receive an especial reward <lb/>
            and honour, and to remain while the others were destroyed, <lb/>
            because it is not only conversant with mortal objects as <lb/>
            they are, but is able also to forsake sueh, and to depart to <lb/>
            the imperishable natures, and to rejoice in the sight of them.</p>
          <p>On which account the holy scriptures very beautifully <lb/>
            represent it as " a little city, and yet not a little one,”* <lb/>
            describing the power of sight under this figure. For it is <lb/>
            said to be little, inasmuch as it is but a small portion of the <lb/>
            faculties which exist in us; and yet great, inasmuch as it <lb/>
            desires great things, being eager to behold the entire heaven <lb/>
            and the whole world.</p>
          <p>XXXII. AVe have now, then, given a full explanation <lb/>
            concerning the vision which appeared to Abraham, and con­ <lb/>
            cerning his celebrated and all-glorious hospitality, in which <lb/>
            the entertainer, who appeared to himself to be entertaining <note type="footnote"> * Genesis mix. 20. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="431"/>
            others, was himself entertained ; expounding every part or <lb/>
            the passage with as much accuracy as we were able. But <lb/>
            we must not pass over in silence the most important action <lb/>
            of all, which is worthy of being listened to. For I was <lb/>
            nearly saying that it is of more importance than all the <lb/>
            actions of piety and religion put together. So we must say <lb/>
            what seems to be seasonable concerning it.</p>
          <p>A legitimate son is borne to the wise man by his wedded <lb/>
            wife, a beloved and only son, very beautiful in his person, <lb/>
            and very excellent in his disposition. For he was already <lb/>
            beginning to display the more perfect exercises of his age, <lb/>
            so that his father felt a most strong and vehement affection <lb/>
            for him, not only from the impulse of natural regard, but <lb/>
            also from the influence of deliberate opinion, from being, as <lb/>
            it were, a judge of his character. To him, then, being con­ <lb/>
            scious of such a disposition, an oracular command suddenly <lb/>
            comes, which was never expected, ordering him to sacrifice <lb/>
            this son on a certain very lofty hill, distant three days' <lb/>
            journey from the city. And he, although attached to his <lb/>
            child by an indescribable fondness, neither changed colour, <lb/>
            nor wavered in his soul, but remained firm in an unyielding <lb/>
            and unalterable purpose, as he was at first. And being <lb/>
            wholly influenced by love towards God, he forcibly repressed <lb/>
            all the names and charms of the natural relationship : and <lb/>
            without mentioning the oracular command to any one of <lb/>
            his household out of all his numerous body of servants, he <lb/>
            took with him the two eldest, who were most thoroughly <lb/>
            attached to their master, as if he were bent upon the cele­ <lb/>
            bration of some ordinary divine rite, and went forth with <lb/>
            his son, making four in all.</p>
          <p>And when, looking as it were from a watch-tower, he saw <lb/>
            the appointed place afar off, he bade his servants remain <lb/>
            there, and he gave his son the fire and the wood to carry, <lb/>
            thinking it proper for the victim himself to be burdened <lb/>
            with the materials for the sacrifice, a very light burden, for <lb/>
            nothing is less troublesome than piety. And as they pro­ <lb/>
            ceeded onwards with equal speed, not marching more rapidly <lb/>
            with their bodies than with their minds along that short <lb/>
            road of which holiness is the end, they at last arrive at the <lb/>
            appointed place. And the father collected stones wherewith <lb/>
            to build the altar; and when his son saw everything else <lb/>
             <pb n="432"/>
            prepared for the celebration of the sacrifice, but no animal, <lb/>
            he looked to his father and said, “My father, behold the <lb/>
            fire and the wood, but where is the victim for the burnt <lb/>
            sacrifice ?" * Therefore, any other father, knowing what he <lb/>
            was about to do, and being depressed in his soul, would have <lb/>
            been thrown into confusion by his son's words, and being <lb/>
            filled with tears, would, out of his excessive affliction, by his <lb/>
            silence have betrayed what was about to be done; but <lb/>
            Abraham, betraying no alteration of voice, or countenance, <lb/>
            or intention, looking at his son with steady eye, answered <lb/>
            his question with a determination more steady still, “ My <lb/>
            child," said he, " God will provide himself a victim for the <lb/>
            burnt offering," although we are in a vast desert where <lb/>
            perhaps you despair of such a thing being found; but all <lb/>
            things are possible to God, even all such things as are im­ <lb/>
            possible and unintelligible to men. And even while saying <lb/>
            this, he seizes his son with all rapidity, and places him on <lb/>
            the altar, and having taken his knife in his right hand, he <lb/>
            raised it over him as if to slay him; but God the Saviour <lb/>
            stopped the deed in the middle, interrupting him by a voice <lb/>
            from heaven, by which he ordered him to stay his hand, and <lb/>
            not to touch the child: calling the father by name twice, so <lb/>
            as to turn him and divert him from his purpose, and forbid <lb/>
            him to complete the sacrifice.</p>
          <p>XXXIII. And so Isaac is saved, God supplying a gift in­ <lb/>
            stead of him, and honouring him who was willing to make the <lb/>
            offering in return for the piety which he had exhibited. But <lb/>
            the action of the father, even though it was not ultimately <lb/>
            given effect to, is nevertheless recorded and engraved as a <lb/>
            complete and perfect sacrifice, not only in the sacred scrip­ <lb/>
            tures, but also in the minds of those who read them. But <lb/>
            to those who are fond of reviling and disparaging every­ <lb/>
            thing, and who are by their invariable habits accustomed to <lb/>
            prefer blaming to praising the action which Abraham was <lb/>
            enjoined to perform, it will not appear a great and admirable <lb/>
            deed, as we imagine it to have been. For such persons say <lb/>
            that many other men, who have been very affectionate to <lb/>
            their relations and very fond of their children, have given up <lb/>
            their sons; some in order that they might be sacrificed for <lb/>
            their country to deliver it either from war, or from drought, <note type="footnote"> it Genesis xxii. 7. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="433"/>
            or from much rain, or from disease and pestilence; and others <lb/>
            to satisfy the demands of some habitual religious observances, <lb/>
            even though there may be no real piety in them.</p>
          <p>At all events they say that some of the most celebrated <lb/>
            men of the Greeks, not merely private individuals but kings <lb/>
            also, caring but little for the children whom they have be­ <lb/>
            gotten, have, by means of their destruction secured safety to <lb/>
            mighty and numerous forces and armies, arrayed together in <lb/>
            an allied body, and have voluntarily slain them as if they <lb/>
            had been enemies. And also that barbarous nations have <lb/>
            for many ages practised the sacrifice of their children as if <lb/>
            it were a holy work and one looked upon with favour by <lb/>
            God, whose wickedness is mentioned by the holy Moses. <lb/>
            For he, blaming them for this pollution, says, that " They <lb/>
            burn their sons and their daughters to their gods."* And <lb/>
            they say that to this very day the Gymnosopbists among the <lb/>
            Indians, when that long or incurable disease, old age, <lb/>
            begins to attack them, before it has got a firm hold of them, <lb/>
            and while they might still last for many years, kindle a fire <lb/>
            and burn themselves. And, moreover, when their husbands <lb/>
            are already dead, they say that their wives rush cheerfully <lb/>
            to the same funeral pile, and whilst living endure to be <lb/>
            burnt along with their husbands' bodies. One may well <lb/>
            admire the exceeding courage of these women, who look thus <lb/>
            contemptuously on death, and disdain it so exceedingly that <lb/>
            they hasten and run impetuously towards it as if they were <lb/>
            grasping immortality.</p>
          <p>XXXIV. But why, say they, ought one to praise Abra­ <lb/>
            ham as the attempter of a wholly novel kind of conduct, <lb/>
            when it is only what private men and kings, and even whole <lb/>
            nations do at appropriate seasons ? But I will make the <lb/>
            following reply to the envy and in-temper of these men.</p>
          <p>Of those who sacrifice their childen, some do so out of <lb/>
            habit, as they say some of the barbarians do; others do it <lb/>
            because they are unable by any other means to place on a <lb/>
            good footing some desperate and important dangers threat­ <lb/>
            ening their cities and countries. And of these men, some <lb/>
            have given up their children because they have been con­ <lb/>
            strained by those more powerful than themselves: and <lb/>
            others, out of a thirst for glory, and honour, and for renown <note type="footnote"> * Deuteronomy xii. 31. </note> <note type="footnote"> VOL. II. </note> <note type="footnote"> F F </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="434"/>
            at the present moment, and celebrity in all future ages. <lb/>
            Now those who sacrifice their children out of deference to <lb/>
            custom, perform, in my opinion, no great exploit; for an <lb/>
            inveterate custom is often as powerful as nature itself; so <lb/>
            that it diminishes the terrible impression made by the <lb/>
            action to be done, and makes even the most miserable and <lb/>
            intolerable evils light to bear. Again : surely, they who <lb/>
            offer up their children out of fear deserve no praise; for <lb/>
            praise is only given to voluntary good actions, but what is <lb/>
            involuntary, is ascribed to other causes than the immediate <lb/>
            actors-to the occasion, or to chance, or to compulsion from <lb/>
            men.</p>
          <p>Again, if any one, out of a desire for glory, abandons <lb/>
            his son or his daughter, he would justly be blamed rather <lb/>
            than praised ; seeking to acquire honour by the death of his <lb/>
            dearest relations, while, even if he had glory, he ought rather <lb/>
            to have risked the loss of it to secure the safety of his <lb/>
            children. We must investigate, therefore, whether Abraham <lb/>
            was under the influence of any one of the aforesaid motives, <lb/>
            custom, or love of glory, or fear, when he was about to sacri­ <lb/>
            fice his son.</p>
          <p>Now Babylon, and Mesopotamia, and the nation of the <lb/>
            Chaldæans, do not receive the custom of sacrificing their <lb/>
            children; and these are the countries in which Abraham <lb/>
            had been brought up and had lived most of his time ; so that <lb/>
            we cannot imagine that his sense of the misfortune that he <lb/>
            was commanded to inflict upon himself was blunted by the <lb/>
            frequency of such events. Again, there was no fear from <lb/>
            men which pressed upon him, for no one knew of this <lb/>
            oracular command which had been given to him alone, nor <lb/>
            was there any common calamity pressing upon the land in <lb/>
            which he was living, such as could only be remedied by the <lb/>
            destruction of his most excellent son.</p>
          <p>May it not have been, however, from a desire to obtain <lb/>
            praise from the multitude that he proceeded to this action ? <lb/>
            But what praise could be obtained in the desert, when there <lb/>
            was no one likely to be present who could possibly say any­ <lb/>
            thing in his favour, and when even his two servants were left <lb/>
            at a distance on purpose that he might not seem to be <lb/>
            hunting after praise, or to be making a display by bringing <lb/>
            witnesses with him to see the greatness of his devotion ?</p><pb n="435"/>
            
          <p>XXXV. Therefore putting a barrier on their unbridled <lb/>
            and evil-speaking mouths, let them moderate that envy <lb/>
            in themselves which hates everything that is good, and let <lb/>
            them forbear to attack the virtues of men who have lived <lb/>
            excellently, which they ought rather to reward and decorate <lb/>
            with panegyric. And that this action of Abraham's was in <lb/>
            reality one deserving of praise and of all love, it is easy to <lb/>
            see from many circumstances. In the first place, then, he <lb/>
            laboured above all men to obey God, which is thought an <lb/>
            excellent thing, and an especial object for all men's desire, <lb/>
            by all right-minded persons, to such a degree, that he never <lb/>
            omitted to perform anything which God commanded him, <lb/>
            not even if it was full of arrogance and ingloriousness, or <lb/>
            even of positive pain and misery; for which reason he also <lb/>
            bore, in a most noble manner, and with the most unshaken <lb/>
            fortitude, the command given to him respecting his son.</p>
          <p>In the second place, though it was not the custom in the <lb/>
            land in which he was living, as perhaps it is among some <lb/>
            nations, to offer human sacrifices, and custom, by its <lb/>
            frequency, often removes the horror felt at the first appear­ <lb/>
            ance of evils, he himself was about to be the first to set the <lb/>
            example of a novel and most extraordinary deed, which I <lb/>
            do not think that any human being would have brought <lb/>
            himself to submit to, even if his soul had been made of iron <lb/>
            or of adamant; for as some one has said,­ <lb/>
            " 'Tis a hard task with nature to contend."</p>
          <p>In the second place, after he had become the father of <lb/>
            this his only legitimate son, he, from the moment of his <lb/>
            birth, cherished towards him all the genuine feelings of <lb/>
            affection, which exceeds all modest love, and all the ties of <lb/>
            friendship which have ever been celebrated in the world. <lb/>
            There was added also, this most forcible charm of all, that <lb/>
            he had become the father of this son not in the prime of <lb/>
            his life, but in his old age. For parents become to a cer­ <lb/>
            tain degree insane in their affection for children of their <lb/>
            old age, either from the circumstance of their having been <lb/>
            wishing for their birth a long time, or else because they <lb/>
            have no longer any hope that they shall have any more; <lb/>
            nature having taken her stand there as at the extreme and <lb/>
            furthest limit. <note type="footnote"> F F 2 </note> <pb n="436"/>
            </p>
          <p>Now there is nothing unnatural or extraordinary in de­ <lb/>
            voting one child to God out of a numerous family, as a sort <lb/>
            of first fruits of all one's children, while one still has plea­ <lb/>
            sure in those who remain alive, who are no small comfort <lb/>
            and alleviation of the grief felt for the one who is sacri­ <lb/>
            ficed. But the man who gives the only beloved son that <lb/>
            he is possessed of performs an action beyond all powers <lb/>
            of language to praise, as he is giving nothing to his own <lb/>
            natural affection, but inclining with his whole will and <lb/>
            heart to show his devotion to God. Accordingly this is an <lb/>
            extraordinary and almost unprecedented action which was <lb/>
            done by Abraham.</p>
          <p>For other men, even if they have yielded up their chil­ <lb/>
            dren to be sacrificed on behalf of the safety of their native <lb/>
            land or of their armies, have either remained at home them­ <lb/>
            selves, or have kept at a distance from the altar of sacri­ <lb/>
            fice ; or at least, if they have been present they have averted <lb/>
            their eyes, and left others to strike the blow which they <lb/>
            have not endured to witness. But this man, like a priest <lb/>
            of sacrifice himself, did himself begin to perform the sacred <lb/>
            rite, although he was a most affectionate father of a son <lb/>
            who was in all respects most excellent. And, perhaps, ac­ <lb/>
            cording to the usual law and custom of burnt offerings he <lb/>
            was intending to solemnise the rite by dividing his son <lb/>
            limb by limb. And so he did not divide his feelings and <lb/>
            allot one part of his regard to his son and another part to <lb/>
            piety to G-od : but he devoted his whole soul, entire and un­ <lb/>
            divided, to holiness; thinking but little of the kindred <lb/>
            blood which flowed in the victim.</p>
          <p>Now of all the circumstances which we have enumerated <lb/>
            what is there which others have in common with Abraham ? <lb/>
            What is there which is not peculiar to him, and excellent <lb/>
            beyond all power of language to praise ? So that every <lb/>
            one who is not by nature envious and a lover of evil must <lb/>
            be struck with amazement and admiration for his excessive <lb/>
            piety, even if he should not call at once to mind all the <lb/>
            particulars on which I have been dwelling, but only some <lb/>
            one of the whole number ; for the conception of any one of <lb/>
            these particulars is sufficient by a brief and faint outline to <lb/>
            display the greatness and loftiness of the father's soul ; <lb/>
            though there is nothing petty in the action of the wise man.</p><pb n="437"/>
            
          <p>XXXVI. But the things which we have here been say­ <lb/>
            ing do not appear solely in the plain and explicit language <lb/>
            of the text of the holy scriptures ; but they appear, more­ <lb/>
            over, to exhibit a nature which is not so evident to the <lb/>
            multitude, but which they who place the objects of the in­ <lb/>
            tellect above those perceptible by the outward senses, and <lb/>
            who are able to appreciate them, recognise. And this <lb/>
            nature is of the following description.</p>
          <p>The victim who was about to be sacrificed is called in <lb/>
            the Chaldæan language, Isaac; but if this name be trans­ <lb/>
            lated into the Grecian language, it signifies "laughter;" <lb/>
            and this laughter is not understood to be that laughter of <lb/>
            the body which is frequent in childish sport, but is the <lb/>
            result of a settled happiness and rejoicing of the mind. <lb/>
            This kind of laughter the wise man is appropriately said to <lb/>
            offer as a sacrifice to God ; showing thus, by a figure, that <lb/>
            to rejoice does properly belong to God alone. For the <lb/>
            human race is subject to sorrow and to exceeding fear, <lb/>
            from evils which are either present or expected, so that <lb/>
            men are either grieved at unexpected evils actually pressing <lb/>
            upon them, or are kept in suspense, and disquietude, and <lb/>
            fear with respect to those which are impending. But the <lb/>
            nature of God is free from grief, and exempt from fear, and <lb/>
            enjoys an immunity from every kind of suffering, and is the <lb/>
            only nature which possesses complete happiness and bless­ <lb/>
            edness.</p>
          <p>Now to the disposition which makes this confession in <lb/>
            sincerity, God is merciful, and compassionate, and kind, <lb/>
            driving envy to a distance from him; and to it he gives a <lb/>
            gift in return, to the full extent of the power of the person <lb/>
            benefited to receive it, and he all but gives such a person <lb/>
            this oracular warning, saying " I well know that the <lb/>
            whole species of joy and rejoicing is the possession of no <lb/>
            other being but me, who am the Father of the universe; <lb/>
            nevertheless, though it belongs to me, I have no objection <lb/>
            to those who deserve it enjoying a share of it. But who <lb/>
            can be deserving to do so, save he who obeys me and my <lb/>
            will ? for to this man it shall be given to feel as little <lb/>
            grief as possible and as little fear as possible, proceeding <lb/>
            along that road which is inaccessible to passions and vices, <lb/>
            but which is frequented by excellence of soul and virtue." <lb/>
             <pb n="438"/>
            And let no one fancy that that unmixed joy, which is <lb/>
            without any alloy of sorrow, descends from heaven to the <lb/>
            earth, but rather, that it is a combination of the two, that <lb/>
            which is the better being predominant in the mixture ; in <lb/>
            the same manner as the light in heaven is unalloyed and <lb/>
            free from any admixture of darkness, but in the sublunary <lb/>
            atmosphere it is mingled with dark air.</p>
          <p>For this reason, it seems to me to have been, that Sarah,* <lb/>
            the namesake of virtue, who had previously laughed, denied <lb/>
            her laughter to the person who questioned her as to the <lb/>
            cause of it, fearing lest she might be deprived of her <lb/>
            rejoicing, as belonging to no created being, but to God <lb/>
            alone; on which account the holy Word encouraged her, <lb/>
            and said, " Be not afraid," thou hast laughed a genuine <lb/>
            laugh, and thou hast a share in real joy; for the Father <lb/>
            has not permitted the race of mankind to be wholly devoured <lb/>
            by griefs, and sorrows, and incurable anguish, but has <lb/>
            mingled in their existence something of a better nature, <lb/>
            thinking it fitting that the soul should sometimes enjoy rest <lb/>
            and tranquillity; and he has also designed that the souls of <lb/>
            wise men should be pleased and delighted for the greater <lb/>
            portion of their existence with the contemplation of the soul.</p>
          <p>XXXVII. This is enough to say about the piety of the <lb/>
            man, though there is a vast abundance of other things <lb/>
            which might be brought forward in praise of it. We must <lb/>
            also investigate his skill and wisdom as displayed towards <lb/>
            his fellow men; for it belongs to the same character to be <lb/>
            pious towards God and affectionate towards man ; and both <lb/>
            these qualities, of holiness towards God and justice towards <lb/>
            man, are commonly seen in the same individual. Now it <lb/>
            would take a long time to go through all the instances and <lb/>
            actions which form this; but it is not out of place to record <lb/>
            two or three.</p>
          <p>Abraham, being rich above most men in abundance of <lb/>
            gold and silver, and having numerous herds of cattle and <lb/>
            flocks of sheep, and being equal in his affluence and abund­ <lb/>
            ance to any of the men of the country, or of the original <lb/>
            inhabitants, who were the most wealthy, and being, in fact, <lb/>
            richer than any sojourner could be expected to be, was <lb/>
            never unpopular with any of the people among whom he <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xviii. iS. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="439"/>
            was dwelling, but was continually praised and beloved by <lb/>
            all who had any acquaintance with him ; and if, as is often <lb/>
            the case, any contention or quarrel arose between his ser­ <lb/>
            vants and retinue and those of others, he always endea­ <lb/>
            voured to terminate it quietly by his gentle disposition, <lb/>
            discarding and driving to a distance from his soul all <lb/>
            quarrelsome, and turbulent, and disorderly things. And <lb/>
            there is no wonder, if he was such towards strangers, who <lb/>
            might have agreed together and with a heavy and power­ <lb/>
            ful hand have repelled him, if he had begun acts of violence, <lb/>
            when he behaved with moderation towards those who were <lb/>
            nearly related to him in blood, but very far removed from <lb/>
            him in disposition, and who were desolate and isolated, and <lb/>
            very inferior in wealth to himself, willingly allowing him­ <lb/>
            self to be inferior to them in the very things in which he <lb/>
            might have been superior; for there was his brother's son, <lb/>
            when he departed from his country, who went forth with <lb/>
            him, an inconstant, variable, whimsical man, inclining now <lb/>
            to one side and now to another ; and at one time caressing <lb/>
            him with friendly salutations, and at another, being restive <lb/>
            and obstinate, by reason of the inequality of his disposi­ <lb/>
            tion ; on which account his household also was a quarrel­ <lb/>
            some and turbulent one, as it had no one to correct it, and <lb/>
            especially his shepherds were so, because they were removed <lb/>
            to a great distance from their master.</p>
          <p>Accordingly, they, in their self.willed manner, behaving <lb/>
            as if they claimed complete liberty, were always quarrel­ <lb/>
            ling with the managers of the flocks of the wise Abraham, <lb/>
            who yielded a great many points, because of the gentle dis­ <lb/>
            position of their master; in consequence of which, the <lb/>
            shepherds of his nephew turned to folly and to shameless <lb/>
            audacity, and gave way to anger, cherishing ill-temper, and <lb/>
            exciting a spirit of irreconcilable enmity in their hearts, <lb/>
            until they compelled those whom they injured to turn to <lb/>
            their own defence; and when a somewhat violent battle <lb/>
            had taken place, the good Abraham, hearing of the attack <lb/>
            made by his servants on the others, though only in self­ <lb/>
            defence, and knowing as he did that his own household <lb/>
            was superior both in numbers and in power, would not <lb/>
            allow the contest to be protracted till victory declared for <lb/>
            his party, in order that he might not grieve his nephew by <lb/>
             <pb n="440"/>
            the defeat of his men; but standing between the two <lb/>
            bodies of combatants, he, by his pacific speeches, reconciled <lb/>
            the contending parties, and that not only for the moment, <lb/>
            but for all future time too; for he knew that if they <lb/>
            continued to dwell together, and to abide in the same <lb/>
            place, they would be always differing in opinion and quar­ <lb/>
            relling with one another, and continually raising up quar­ <lb/>
            rels and wars with one another. In order that this might <lb/>
            not be the case, he thought it desirable to abandon the <lb/>
            custom of dwelling together, and to separate his habita­ <lb/>
            tion from that of his nephew. So, sending for his nephew, <lb/>
            he gave him the choice of the better country, cheerfully <lb/>
            agreeing himself to abandon whatever portion the other <lb/>
            selected, as he should thus acquire the greatest of all <lb/>
            gains, namely, peace; and yet, what other man would ever <lb/>
            have yielded in any point whatever to one weaker than <lb/>
            himself, while he was stronger ? and who that was able to <lb/>
            gain the victory would ever have been willing to be de­ <lb/>
            feated, without availing himself of his power ? But this <lb/>
            man alone placed the object of his desires, not in strength <lb/>
            and superiority, but in a life free from dissension and <lb/>
            blessed with tranquillity, as far as depended on himself; <lb/>
            for which reason he appears the most admirable of all <lb/>
            men.</p>
          <p>XXXVIII. Since then this panegyric, if taken lite­ <lb/>
            rally, is applied to Abraham as a man, and since the dis­ <lb/>
            position of the soul is here intimated, it will be well for <lb/>
            us to investigate that also, after the fashion of those men <lb/>
            who go from the letter to the spirit of any statement. <lb/>
            Now there is an infinite variety of dispositions which arise <lb/>
            from different circumstances and opportunities in every <lb/>
            kind of action and event; but in this instance, we must <lb/>
            distinguish between two characters, one of which is the <lb/>
            elder and the other the younger.</p>
          <p>Now the elder of the two is that disposition which <lb/>
            honours those things which are by nature principal and <lb/>
            dominant; the younger is that which regards the things <lb/>
            which are subject to others, and which are considered in <lb/>
            the lowest rank.</p>
          <p>Now the principal and more dominant things are wisdom, <lb/>
            and temperance, and justice, and courage, and every descrip­ <lb/>
             <pb n="441"/>
            tion of virtue, and the actions in accordance with virtue; <lb/>
            the younger things are wealth, and authority, and glory, <lb/>
            and nobility, not real nobility, but that which the multi­ <lb/>
            tude think so, and all those other things which belong to <lb/>
            the third class, next after the things of the soul, and the <lb/>
            things of the body; the class which is in fact the last. <lb/>
            Each then of these dispositions has, as it were, flocks and <lb/>
            herds. The one which desires external things has for its <lb/>
            flock, gold and silver, and all those things which are the <lb/>
            materials and furniture of wealth ; and, moreover, arms, <lb/>
            engines, triremes, armies of infantry and cavalry, and fleets <lb/>
            of ships, and all kinds of provisions to procure dominion, <lb/>
            by which firm authority is secured.</p>
          <p>But the lover of excellence has for his flock the doctrines <lb/>
            of each individual virtue, and its speculations respecting <lb/>
            wisdom. Moreover, there are overseers and superintend­ <lb/>
            ents of each of these flocks, just as there are shepherds <lb/>
            to flocks of sheep. Of the flock of external things, the <lb/>
            superintendents are those who are fond of money, those <lb/>
            who are fond of glory, those who are eager for war, and <lb/>
            all those who love authority over multitudes. And the <lb/>
            managers of the flock of things concerning the soul are <lb/>
            all those who are lovers of virtue and of what is honour­ <lb/>
            able, and who do not prefer spurious good things to genuine <lb/>
            ones, but genuine to spurious good. There is therefore a <lb/>
            certain natural contest between them, inasmuch as they <lb/>
            have no opinions in common with one another, but are <lb/>
            always at variance and difference respecting the matter <lb/>
            which has of all others the greatest influence in the main­ <lb/>
            tenance of life as it should be, that is to say, the judgment <lb/>
            of what things are truly good.</p>
          <p>Now, for some time the soul was warred against by some <lb/>
            enemy, and was full of this quarrelsome principle, inasmuch <lb/>
            as it had not yet been completely pacified, but was still <lb/>
            troubled by some passions and diseases which prevailed <lb/>
            over sound reason. But from the time when it began to be <lb/>
            more powerful, and with its superior force, to destroy the <lb/>
            fortification of the opposite opinions, becoming elated and <lb/>
            puffed up with pride, it in a most marvellous manner <lb/>
            began to separate and detach the disposition in itself, <lb/>
            which admires the external materials, and as if conversing <lb/>
             <pb n="442"/>
            with man, says to him, Thou art unable to dwell with-it <lb/>
            is impossible that thou shouldest be connected by alliance <lb/>
            with-a lover, of wisdom and virtue. Come, then, and <lb/>
            migrating from thy present abode, depart to a distance, <lb/>
            since you have no communion with me, and, indeed, cannot <lb/>
            possibly have any. For all the things which you conceive to <lb/>
            be on the right he imagines to be on the left; and on the <lb/>
            contrary, whatever you think is on the left, is looked upon <lb/>
            by him as on the right.</p>
          <p>XXXIX. Therefore the virtuous man was not only <lb/>
            peaceful and a lover of justice, but also a man of courage and <lb/>
            of a warlike disposition ; not for the sake of making war, for <lb/>
            he was not of a contentious and quarrelsome character, <lb/>
            but for the sake of a lasting peace for the future, which <lb/>
            hitherto his adversaries had destroyed. And the most con­ <lb/>
            vincing proof of this is to be found in what he did. Four <lb/>
            great kings had received for their inheritance the eastern <lb/>
            portion of the inhabited world ; and they were obeyed by <lb/>
            all the eastern nations, both on this and on the other side <lb/>
            of the Euphrates. Now all the other parts remained un­ <lb/>
            harassed by contentions, obeying the commands of these <lb/>
            kings, and contributing their yearly taxes and tribute with­ <lb/>
            out seeking for any excuses ; but the land of the inhabitants <lb/>
            of Sodom alone before it was destroyed by fire began to <lb/>
            break the peace, having been designing to revolt for a long <lb/>
            time.</p>
          <p>For as it was a very rich country it was ruled by five <lb/>
            kings, who had divided the cities and the land among them, <lb/>
            though the district was not an extensive one, but fertile in <lb/>
            corn and trees, and abounding in all kinds of fruit. What <lb/>
            then their size gives to other cities, that the excellence of <lb/>
            its soil gives to Sodom; on which account it had many <lb/>
            princes for lovers who admired its beauty. These, on all <lb/>
            other occasions, had paid the appointed revenues to the <lb/>
            collectors of the taxes, honouring and at the same time <lb/>
            fearing those more powerful sovereigns of whom they were <lb/>
            the viceroys.</p>
          <p>But when they were completely sated with good things, <lb/>
            and when, as is ordinarily the case, satiety had begotten <lb/>
            insolence, they, cherishing a pride beyond their power! began <lb/>
            at first to lift up their heads and to become restive. Then, <lb/>
             <pb n="443"/>
            like wicked servants, they set upon their masters, trusting <lb/>
            more to their factious spirit than to their strength. But <lb/>
            their sovereigns, remembering their own nobleness and <lb/>
            being fortified with superior power, went against them with <lb/>
            great disdain, as if they would be able to defeat them by <lb/>
            the mere cry of battle. And having engaged them in battle, <lb/>
            they in a moment put some of them to flight, and others <lb/>
            they slew in the flight, and so they destroyed their army to <lb/>
            a man. And also they led away a vast multitude captive, <lb/>
            which they distributed among themselves with much other <lb/>
            booty. Moreover, they led away captive the brother's son <lb/>
            of the wise Abraham, who had a little while before emigrated <lb/>
            into one of the cities of the Pentapolis.</p>
          <p>XL. This was communicated to Abraham by some one of <lb/>
            those who escaped from the defeat of his countrymen, and <lb/>
            it grieved him exceedingly, and he would not be quiet any <lb/>
            longer, being much concerned at what had happened, and <lb/>
            mourning more for him alive and in captivity than if he had <lb/>
            heard that he had been killed. For he knew that death <lb/>
            (<foreign xml:lang="grc">τελετὴ</foreign>) as its very name imports, was the end <foreign xml:lang="grc">τέλος</foreign>) of all <lb/>
            living beings, and especially of the wicked, and that there <lb/>
            are innumerable unexpected evils which lie, as it were, in <lb/>
            ambush for the living. But when he was preparing to <lb/>
            pursue them for the purpose of delivering his brother's son, <lb/>
            he found himself in want of allies, inasmuch as he himself <lb/>
            was a stranger and a sojourner and as no one could dare to <lb/>
            oppose the irresistible power of such mighty monarchs <lb/>
            flushed with recent victory. And he devised for himself a <lb/>
            most novel alliance. For necessity is the mother of invention, <lb/>
            and expedients are found in the most difficult circumstances <lb/>
            when a man has set his heart on just and humane objects. <lb/>
            For having collected together all his servants, and ordering <lb/>
            the slaves whom he had purchased to remain at home (for <lb/>
            he was afraid of desertion on their part), he assembled all <lb/>
            his domestic servants, and divided them into centuries, and <lb/>
            marched forward in their battalions; not, indeed, trusting <lb/>
            to them, for his was still a most insignificant force, in com­ <lb/>
            parison with that of the king's, but placing his confidence <lb/>
            in the champion and defender of the just, namely in God.</p>
          <p>Therefore putting forth all his exertions he hastened on, <lb/>
            in nowise relaxing his speed, until, watching his oppor­ <lb/>
             <pb n="444"/>
            tunity, he fell upon the enemy by night, after they had <lb/>
            supped, and when they were just on the point of betaking <lb/>
            themselves to sleep. And some he slew in their beds, and <lb/>
            those who were arrayed against him he utterly destroyed, <lb/>
            and with great vigour he defeated them all, more by the <lb/>
            courage of his soul than by the adequacy of his means. <lb/>
            And he did not cease from attacking them until lie had <lb/>
            utterly destroyed the hostile army with their kings, and <lb/>
            slain them all to a man in front of their camp, and had <lb/>
            brought back his brother's son after this splendid and most <lb/>
            glorious victory, bringing back also as fair booty all their <lb/>
            cavalry, and all the multitude of their beasts of burden, and <lb/>
            a most enormous quantity of spoil.</p>
          <p>And when the great high priest of the most high God <lb/>
            beheld him returning and coming back loaded with trophies, <lb/>
            in safety himself, with all his own force uninjured, for he <lb/>
            had not lost one single man of all those who went out with <lb/>
            him ; marvelling at the greatness of the exploit, and, as was <lb/>
            very natural, considering that he had never met with this <lb/>
            success but through the favour of the divine wisdom and <lb/>
            alliance, he raised his hands to heaven, and honoured him <lb/>
            with prayers in his behalf, and offered up sacrifices of <lb/>
            thanksgiving for his victory, and splendidly feasted all those <lb/>
            who had had a share in the expedition; rejoicing and sym­ <lb/>
            pathising with him as if the success had been his own, and <lb/>
            in reality it did greatly concern him. For as the proverb <lb/>
            says:­ <lb/>
            " All that befalls from friends we common call." <lb/>
            And much more are all instances of good fortune common <lb/>
            to those whose main object it is to please God.</p>
          <p>XLI. These things, then, are what are contained in the <lb/>
            plain words of the scriptures. But as many as are able to <lb/>
            contemplate the facts related in them in their incorporeal <lb/>
            and naked state, living rather in the soul than in the body, <lb/>
            will say that of the nine kings the four are the powers of the <lb/>
            four passions which exist within us, the passion of pleasure, <lb/>
            of desire, of fear, and of grief; and that the other five <lb/>
            kings are the outward senses, being equal in number, the <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xiv. 23. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="445"/>
            sense of sight, of hearing, of smell, of taste, and of touch. <lb/>
            For these in some degree are sovereigns and rulers, having <lb/>
            acquired a certain power over us, but not all to an equal <lb/>
            extent; for the five are subordinate to the four, and are <lb/>
            compelled to pay them taxes and tribute, such as are <lb/>
            appointed by nature. For it is from the things which we <lb/>
            see, or hear, or smell, or taste, or touch, that pleasures, and <lb/>
            pains, and fears, and desires arise; as there is no one of the <lb/>
            passions which has any power to exist of itself, if it were <lb/>
            not supplied by the materials furnished by the outward <lb/>
            senses.</p>
          <p>For it is in these things that their powers consist, either <lb/>
            in figures and in colours, or in the faculty of speaking or <lb/>
            hearing which depends on the voice, or in flavours, or in <lb/>
            odours, or by the subjects of touch, whether they are soft <lb/>
            or hard, or rough, or smooth, or hot, or cold. For all these <lb/>
            things are supplied to each of the passions by means of the <lb/>
            outward senses. And as long as the taxes beforementioned <lb/>
            are paid the alliance among the kings remains ; but when <lb/>
            they are no longer contributed, as they were before, then <lb/>
            immediately do quarrels and wars arise. And this appears <lb/>
            to happen when painful old age supervenes, in which none <lb/>
            of the passions becomes weaker, but rather perhaps stronger <lb/>
            than their ancient power; but the sight becomes dim, and <lb/>
            the ears hard of hearing, and every one of the other out­ <lb/>
            ward senses more blunt, being no longer equally able as <lb/>
            before to judge and decide accurately of every subject sub­ <lb/>
            mitted to them, nor any longer to pay a tribute which will <lb/>
            be equal to the number of the passions.</p>
          <p>So that it happened very naturally that they being <lb/>
            thoroughly exhausted and laid prostrate by them were easily <lb/>
            put to flight by the adverse passions ; and the statement <lb/>
            that follows is in strict consistency with what might be <lb/>
            naturally expected, namely, that of the five kings two fell <lb/>
            into wells, and three took to flight. For touch and taste <lb/>
            reach to the very deepest portions of the body, sending down <lb/>
            into the entrails those things which are suitable for diges­ <lb/>
            tion ; but the eyes, and the ears, and the smell, roaming <lb/>
            abroad for the most part, escape the slavery of the body.</p>
          <p>The good man—threatening to attack all of these, when <lb/>
            he saw that those who had lately been friends and con­ <lb/>
             <pb n="446"/>
            federates were now in a state of. disease, and that there was <lb/>
            war instead of peace arising among the nine kingdoms, as <lb/>
            the four kings were contending with the five for sovereignty <lb/>
            and dominion-on a sudden, having watched his opportunity, <lb/>
            attacked them; being desirous of the establishment of de­ <lb/>
            mocracy in the soul, the most excellent of constitutions <lb/>
            instead of tyrannies and absolute sovereignties, and wishing <lb/>
            also to introduce law and justice instead of lawlessness and <lb/>
            injustice, which had prevailed up to that time. And what <lb/>
            its here said is not a cunningly devised fable, but is rather <lb/>
            one of the most completely true facts, which may be seen to <lb/>
            be true in our own selves. For it very often happens that <lb/>
            the outward senses observe a sort of confederacy which <lb/>
            they have formed with the passions, supplying them with <lb/>
            objects perceptible by the outward senses ; and very often <lb/>
            also, they raise contentions, no longer choosing to pay the <lb/>
            tribute fairly due from them, or else being unable to do so, <lb/>
            by reason of the presence of corrective reason ; which when <lb/>
            it has taken up its complete armour, namely, the virtues, <lb/>
            and their doctrines and contemplations, which form an <lb/>
            irresistible power, conquers all things in the most vigorous <lb/>
            manner. For it is not lawful for perishable things to dwell <lb/>
            with what is immortal. Therefore the nine sovereignties of <lb/>
            the four passions and the five outward senses are both <lb/>
            perishable themselves and also the causes of mortality. <lb/>
            But the truly sacred and divine word, which uses the virtues <lb/>
            as a starting place, being placed in the number ten, that <lb/>
            perfect number, when it descends into the contest and <lb/>
            exerts that more vigorous power which it has in accordance <lb/>
            with God, subdues by main force all the aforesaid powers.</p>
          <p>XLII. And at a subsequent period his wife dies, she who <lb/>
            was most dear to his mind and most excellent in all respects, <lb/>
            having given innumerable proofs of her affection towards <lb/>
            her husband in leaving all her relations together with him ; <lb/>
            and in her unhesitating migration from her own country, <lb/>
            and in her continued and uninterrupted wanderings in a <lb/>
            foreign land, and in her endurance of want and scarcity, <lb/>
            and in her accompanying him in his warlike expeditions. <lb/>
            For she was always with him at all times, and in all places, <lb/>
            never being absent from any spot, or failing to share any of <lb/>
            his fortune, being truly the partner of his life, and of all <lb/>
             <pb n="447"/>
            the circumstances of his life; judging it right equally to <lb/>
            share all his good and evil fortune together with him. For <lb/>
            she did not, as some persons do, shun any participation in, <lb/>
            his misfortunes, but lie in wait only for his prosperity, but <lb/>
            with all cheerfulness took her share in both, as was fitting <lb/>
            and becoming to a wedded wife.</p>
          <p>XLIII. And though I might have many topics for pane­ <lb/>
            gyric on this woman, still I will only mention one, which <lb/>
            shall be the most manifest possible proof of all the others. <lb/>
            For she, being barren and childless, and fearing lest her <lb/>
            husband's God-loving house might be left entirely destitute <lb/>
            of offspring, came to her husband and spoke as follows :— <lb/>
            " We have now lived together a long time mutually pleasing <lb/>
            each; but we have no children, which is the cause for which <lb/>
            we ourselves came together, and for which also nature de­ <lb/>
            signed the original connection between husband and wife ; <lb/>
            nor indeed can there be any hope of your having any <lb/>
            offspring by me, since I am now beyond the age of child- <lb/>
            bearing ; do not you then suffer for my barrenness, and do <lb/>
            not, out of your affection for me, while you are yourself <lb/>
            able still to become a father, be hindered from being so. <lb/>
            For I shall not feel any jealousy towards another woman <lb/>
            whom you may marry, not for the gratification of irrational <lb/>
            appetite, but in order to satisfy a necessary law of nature. <lb/>
            For which reason I will not delay to deck a new bride for <lb/>
            you, that she may fulfil what is wanting on my part. And <lb/>
            if the prayers which we will offer up for the birth ot <lb/>
            children be blessed with success, then the children which are <lb/>
            born shall be your own legitimate children, but by adoption <lb/>
            they shall be by all means mine.</p>
          <p>" And that you may have no suspicion of any jealousy on <lb/>
            my part, take, if you will, my own handmaid to wife ; who <lb/>
            is a slave indeed as to her body, but free and noble as to <lb/>
            her mind; whose good qualities I have for a long time <lb/>
            proved and experienced from the day when she was first <lb/>
            introduced into my house, being an Egyptian by blood, and <lb/>
            a Hebrew by deliberate choice. We have great substance <lb/>
            and abundant wealth, not like people who are sojourners. <lb/>
            For even already we surpass the natives themselves in the <lb/>
            brilliancy of our prosperity, but still we have no heir or <lb/>
             <pb n="448"/>
            successor, and that, too, though there might be one, if you <lb/>
            would be guided by my advice."</p>
          <p>But Abraham, marvelling more and more at the love of his <lb/>
            wife for her husband thus continually being renewed and <lb/>
            gaining fresh strength, and also at her spirit of forecast so <lb/>
            desirous to provide for the future, takes to himself the hand­ <lb/>
            maid who had been approved by her to the extent of having <lb/>
            a son by her; though as those who give the most clear and <lb/>
            probable account say he cohabited with her only till she <lb/>
            became pregnant; and when she conceived, which she did <lb/>
            after no long interval, he then desisted from all connection <lb/>
            with her, by reason of his natural continence, and also of <lb/>
            the honour in which he held his wife. So then he speedily <lb/>
            had a son by this handmaid, but at a very distant period <lb/>
            after this he had also a legitimate son, after he and his wife <lb/>
            had both despaired of any offspring from one another. The <lb/>
            bounteous God having thus bestowed on them a reward for <lb/>
            their excellence more perfect than their highest hopes.</p>
          <p>XLIV. It is sufficient to mention this as a proof of the <lb/>
            virtue of Abraham's wife. But the topics of praise of the <lb/>
            wise man himself are more numerous, some of which I <lb/>
            have lately enumerated. Moreover I will mention also one <lb/>
            circumstance connected with the death of the wife, which <lb/>
            ought not to be buried in silence. For when Abraham had <lb/>
            lost such a partner of his whole life, as our account has <lb/>
            shown her to have been, and as the scriptures testify that <lb/>
            she was, he still like a wrestler prevailed over the grief <lb/>
            which attacked him and threatened to overwhelm his soul; <lb/>
            strengthening and encouraging with great virtue and reso­ <lb/>
            lution, reason, the natural adversary of the passions, which <lb/>
            indeed he had always taken as a counsellor during the whole <lb/>
            of his life ; but at this time above all others, he thought fit <lb/>
            to be guided by it, when it was giving him the best and <lb/>
            most expedient advice. And the advice was this; not to <lb/>
            afflict himself beyond all measure, as if he were stricken <lb/>
            down with a novel and unprecedented calamity; nor, on the <lb/>
            other hand, to give way to indifference, as if nothing had <lb/>
            happened calculated to give him sorrow. But rather to <lb/>
            choose the middle way in preference to either extreme ; and <lb/>
            to endeavour to grieve in a moderate decree ; not being <lb/>
             <pb n="449"/>
            indignant at nature for having reclaimed what belonged to <lb/>
            her as her due ; and bearing what had befallen him with a <lb/>
            mild and gentle spirit.</p>
          <p>And there are evidences of these assertions to be seen in <lb/>
            the holy scriptures; which it is impossible should be con­ <lb/>
            victed of false witness, and they tell us that Abraham, <lb/>
            having wept a short time over his wife's body, soon rose <lb/>
            up from the corpse; thinking, as it should seem, that to <lb/>
            mourn any longer would be inconsistent with that wisdom <lb/>
            by which he had been taught that he was not to look upon <lb/>
            death as the extinction of the soul, but rather as a separation <lb/>
            and disjunction of it from the body, returning back to the <lb/>
            region from whence it came ; and it came, as is fully shown <lb/>
            in the history of the creation of the world, from God.</p>
          <p>But just as no man of moderation or sense would be <lb/>
            indignant at having to repay a debt to a lender or to return <lb/>
            a deposit to the man who had deposited it; so, in the same <lb/>
            manner, he did not think it becoming to show impatience <lb/>
            when nature reclaimed what belonged to her, but preferred <lb/>
            to bear what was inevitable with cheerfulness. And when <lb/>
            the magistrates of that country came to sympathise with <lb/>
            him in his sorrow, seeing none of the customary signs of <lb/>
            woe which were usually exhibited in their land by mourners, <lb/>
            no loud wailing or howling, no beating of the breast, no <lb/>
            loud cries of men or women, but a steady, sober depression <lb/>
            of spirits on the part of the whole household, they mar­ <lb/>
            velled exceedingly, even though they had been previously <lb/>
            full of astonishment and admiration at all the rest of the <lb/>
            man's way of life. And then, not concealing in their own <lb/>
            minds their ideas of the greatness and beauty of his virtue, <lb/>
            for it was all admirable, they approached him and addressed <lb/>
            him thus :-" Thou art a king from God among us." * Speak­ <lb/>
            ing most truly, for all other kingdoms are established by <lb/>
            man by means of wars, and military expeditions, and inde­ <lb/>
            scribable evils, which those persons who aim at power inflict <lb/>
            mutually on one another, slaying one another, and raising <lb/>
            up vast forces of infantry, and cavalry, and fleets. But the <lb/>
            kingdom of the wise man is bestowed upon him by God ; <lb/>
            and the virtuous man receiving it is not the cause of evil to <lb/>
            any one, but is rather the author to all his subjects of the <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xxiii. 6. </note> <note type="footnote"> VOL. II. </note> <note type="footnote"> G G </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="450"/>
            acquisition and also of the use of good things, proclaiming <lb/>
            to them peace and obedience to the law.</p>
          <p>XLV. There is also another praise of him recorded in his <lb/>
            honour and testified to in the holy scriptures, which Moses <lb/>
            has written, in which it is related of him that he believed in <lb/>
            God; which is a statement brief indeed in words, but of <lb/>
            great magnitude and importance to be confirmed in fact. <lb/>
            For on whom else can we believe ? Are we to trust in <lb/>
            authorities, or in glory and honour, or in abundance of wealth <lb/>
            and noble birth, or in good health and a good condition of <lb/>
            the senses and mind, or in vigour of body and beauty of per­ <lb/>
            son ? But in truth every kind of authority is unstable, as <lb/>
            it has innumerable enemies lying in wait to attack it. And <lb/>
            if in any instance it is firmly established, it is only so con­ <lb/>
            firmed by innumerable evils and calamities which those who <lb/>
            are in authority both inflict and suffer. Again, honours and <lb/>
            glory are most unstable, being tossed about among the in­ <lb/>
            discriminate inclinations and feeble language of careless and <lb/>
            imprudent men; and even if they endure, their nature is <lb/>
            not such as to produce any genuine good. And as for riches <lb/>
            and illustrious birth, those things sometimes fall to the lot <lb/>
            of the most worthless of men. And even if they should be­ <lb/>
            long only to the virtuous, still they are but the praises of <lb/>
            their ancestors and of fortune, and not of those who now <lb/>
            possess them.</p>
          <p>Nor, again, is it right for a man to pride himself on his <lb/>
            personal advantages, in which other animals are superior to <lb/>
            him. For what man is stronger or more vigorous than a <lb/>
            bull among domestic animals, or than a lion among wild <lb/>
            beasts ? And what man is more sharp-sighted than a falcon <lb/>
            or an eagle ? And what man is so richly endowed with the <lb/>
            sense of hearing as that stupidest of all animals, the ass ? <lb/>
            Also what man is more accurate in his sense of smell than a <lb/>
            hound, who huntsmen say can trace out by means of his <lb/>
            n se animals who are lying at a distance, and can run up to <lb/>
            them with perfect correctness, and course, though he has not <lb/>
            seen them; for what sight is to other animals that is the <lb/>
            sense of smell to hounds and to all the dogs which pursue <lb/>
            game.</p>
          <p>Moreover, the greater part of the irrational animals enjoy <lb/>
            excellent health, and are as far as possible entirely exempt <lb/>
             <pb n="451"/>
            from disease. And also in any competition in respect of <lb/>
            beauty, some things which are even destitute of vitality, ap­ <lb/>
            pear to me to surpass the elegance of either men or women; <lb/>
            as, for instance, images, and statues, and pictures, and in a <lb/>
            word all the works of either the pictorial or plastic art which <lb/>
            arrive at excellence in either branch, and which are the ob­ <lb/>
            jects of study and desire both to Greeks and barbarians, <lb/>
            who erect them in the most conspicuous places for the orna­ <lb/>
            ment of their cities.</p>
          <p>XLVI. Therefore, the only real, and true, and lasting good <lb/>
            is trust in God, the comfort of life, the fulfilment of all <lb/>
            good hopes, the absence of all evils, and the attendant source <lb/>
            of blessings, the repudiation of all unhappiness, the recognition <lb/>
            of piety, the inheritance of all happiness, the improvement <lb/>
            of the soul in every respect, as it thus relies for support on <lb/>
            the cause of all things, who is able to do everything but who <lb/>
            wills only to do what is best. For as men who are going <lb/>
            along a slippery road stumble and fall, but they who proceed <lb/>
            by a dry, and level, and plain path, journey on without <lb/>
            stumbling; so also those men who are conducting their soul <lb/>
            through the road of bodily and external good things are <lb/>
            only accustoming it to fall; for these things are full of <lb/>
            stumbling and the most insecure of all. But they who by <lb/>
            those speculations which are in accordance with virtue, <lb/>
            hasten towards God, are guiding their souls in a safe and <lb/>
            untroubled path. So that we may say with the most abso­ <lb/>
            lute truth, that the man who trusts in the good things of <lb/>
            the body disbelieves in God, and that he who distrusts them <lb/>
            believes in him.</p>
          <p>But not only do the holy scriptures bear witness to the <lb/>
            faith of Abraham in the living God, which faith is the queen <lb/>
            of all the virtues, but moreover he is the first man whom <lb/>
            they speak of as an elder ; though there were men who had <lb/>
            preceded him who had lived three times as many years (or <lb/>
            even more still) as he had, not one of whom is handed down <lb/>
            to us as worthy of the appellation. And may we not say <lb/>
            that this is in strict accordance with natural truth ? For he <lb/>
            who is really an elder is looked upon as such, not with re­ <lb/>
            ference to his length of time, but to the praiseworthiness of <lb/>
            his life. Those men, therefore, who have spent a long life <lb/>
            in that existence which is in accordance with the body, apart <note type="footnote"> G G 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="452"/>
            from all virtue, we must call only long-lived children, having <lb/>
            never been instructed in those branches of education which <lb/>
            befit grey hairs. But the man who has been a lover of pru­ <lb/>
            dence, and wisdom, and faith in God, one may justly denomi­ <lb/>
            nate an elder, forming his name by a slight change from the <lb/>
            first. For in real truth the wise man is the first man in the <lb/>
            human race, being what a pilot is in a ship, a governor in a <lb/>
            city, a general in war, the soul in the body, or the mind in <lb/>
            the soul; or again, what the heaven is in the world, and <lb/>
            what God is in heaven. And God, admiring this man for <lb/>
            his faith (<foreign xml:lang="grc">πίστις</foreign>) in him, gives him a pledge (<foreign xml:lang="grc">πίστις</foreign>) in re­ <lb/>
            turn, namely, a confirmation by an oath of the gifts which <lb/>
            he had promised him; no longer conversing with him as <lb/>
            God might with man, but as one friend with another.</p>
          <p>For he says, " By myself have I sworn,"* by him that is <lb/>
            whose word is an oath, in order that Abraham's mind may <lb/>
            be established still more firmly and immoveably than before. <lb/>
            Let the virtuous man both be and be called the elder and <lb/>
            the first, and let every fool be called the younger and the <lb/>
            last, since he only pursues such objects as may produce <lb/>
            revolution and as are placed in the lowest rank.</p>
          <p>Thus much is sufficient to say on this subject. But God, <lb/>
            adding to the multitude and magnitude of the praises of the <lb/>
            wise man one single thing as a crowning point, says that <lb/>
            " this man fulfilled the divine law, and all the command­ <lb/>
            ments of God,"t not having been taught to do so by written <lb/>
            books, but in accordance with the unwritten law of his <lb/>
            nature, being anxious to obey all healthful and salutary im­ <lb/>
            pulses. And what is the duty of man except most firmly to <lb/>
            believe those things which God asserts ?</p>
          <p>Such is the life of the first author and founder of our <lb/>
            nation ; a man according to the law, as some persons think, <lb/>
            but, as my argument has shown, one who is himself the un­ <lb/>
            written law and justice of God. <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xv. 6. </note> <note type="footnote"> f Genesis xxvi. 5. </note> <pb n="453"/>

          </head>
          <p>I. THERE are three different modes by which we proceed <lb/>
            towards the most excellent end, namely, instruction, nature, <lb/>
            and practice. There are also three persons, the oldest of <lb/>
            the wise men who in the account given to us by Moses <lb/>
            derive three names from these modes, whose lives I have <lb/>
            now discussed, having examined the man who arrived at ex­ <lb/>
            cellence in consequence of instruction, and him who was <lb/>
            self-taught, and him who attained to the proposed end by <lb/>
            practice. Accordingly, proceeding in regular order, I will <lb/>
            now describe the life of the man occupied in civil affairs. <lb/>
            And again, Moses has given us one of the patriachs as de­ <lb/>
            riving his name from this kind of life, in which he had been <lb/>
            immersed from his earliest youth.</p>
          <p>Now, this man began from the time he was seventeen <lb/>
            years of age to be occupied with the consideration of the <lb/>
            business of a shepherd, which corresponds to political busi­ <lb/>
            ness. On which account I think it is that the race of poets <lb/>
            has been accustomed to call kings the shepherds of the <lb/>
            people ; for he who is skilful in the business of a shepherd <lb/>
            will probably be also a most excellent king, having derived <lb/>
            instruction in those matters which are deserving of inferior <lb/>
            attention here to superintend a flock of those most excellent <lb/>
            of all animals, namely, of men. And just as attention to <lb/>
            matters of hunting is indispensable to the man who is about <lb/>
            to conduct a war or to govern an army, so in the same <lb/>
            manner those who hope to have the government of a city <lb/>
            will find the business of a shepherd very closely connected <lb/>
            with them, since that is as it were a sort of prelude to any <lb/>
            kind of government. Therefore, as this man's father per­ <lb/>
            ceived in his son a very noble ability, and too great to be <lb/>
            left in the obscurity of a private station, he admired him, and <lb/>
            cultivated his talent, and loved him more than his other <lb/>
            sons ; because, too, he was the son of his old age, which last <lb/>
            cause is one of the strongest incentives to affection possible. <lb/>
             <pb n="454"/>
            And like a man fond of virtue, he cherished and kindled the <lb/>
            natural good disposition of his son by excessive and most <lb/>
            diligent care and attention, in order that it might not only <lb/>
            not be smothered, but might shine forth more brilliantly.</p>
          <p>II. But envy is at all times an adversary to great good <lb/>
            fortune, and at this time it attacked a house which was pros­ <lb/>
            pering in all its parts, and divided it, setting all the brothers <lb/>
            in enmity against one, who displayed an ill feeling on their <lb/>
            own parts, sufficient to counterbalance the affection of his <lb/>
            father, hating their brother as much as their father loved <lb/>
            him; but they did not divulge their hatred by words, but <lb/>
            kept it in their own bosoms, on which account it very na­ <lb/>
            turally became more grievous and bitter; for passions which <lb/>
            are repressed, and which are not allowed to evaporate in <lb/>
            language, are more difficult to bear. This man, therefore, <lb/>
            indulging a disposition free from all guile and malice, and <lb/>
            having no suspicion of the ill will which was secretly che­ <lb/>
            rished against him by his brethren, having seen a dream of <lb/>
            favourable import, related it to them, as if they were well <lb/>
            affected towards him.</p>
          <p>" For," said he, "I thought that the time of harvest was <lb/>
            arrived, and that we had all gone down to the plain to <lb/>
            gather the crops, and had taken sickles in our hands to reap <lb/>
            the harvest, and on a sudden my sheaf appeared to stand up, <lb/>
            right, and to be raised up, and to erect itself; and I thought <lb/>
            that your sheaves, as if at an appointed signal, ran up and <lb/>
            fell down before it, and worshipped it with great earnest­ <lb/>
            ness."* But they being men of acute intelligence, and <lb/>
            shrewd in divining the nature of a matter thus intimated to <lb/>
            them by means of a figure, with very felicitous conjectures, <lb/>
            replied, “ Dost thou think that thou shalt be king and lord <lb/>
            over us ? for this is what you are now intimating by this <lb/>
            lying vision of yours." So their hatred was kindled against <lb/>
            him more exceedingly than before, as it was continually <lb/>
            receiving some fresh pretext for its increase. And he, sus­ <lb/>
            pecting nothing, a few days afterwards saw another dream, <lb/>
            still more astonishing than the former one, and again he <lb/>
            related it to his brethren; for he thought that the sun, and <lb/>
            the moon, and the eleven stars, all came and worshipped <lb/>
            him, so that his father marvelling at what had thus hap­ <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xxxvii. 7. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="455"/>
            pened, laid these events up in his mind, cherishing them, <lb/>
            and considering within himself what was to happen. But <lb/>
            he reproved his son gravely, from a fear that he might be <lb/>
            doing wrong in some respect, and said to him, " Shall I, and <lb/>
            thy mother, and thy brethren, be able to fall down and <lb/>
            worship thee ? for by the sun you appear to indicate your <lb/>
            father, and by the moon your mother, and by the eleven <lb/>
            stars your eleven brethren ? Let not such an idea ever <lb/>
            come into your mind, 0 my son. But rather let all recollec­ <lb/>
            tion of these visions which have appeared to you be for­ <lb/>
            gotten, and let them pass from your mind ; for to hope and <lb/>
            expect a superiority over those of your family and kindred, <lb/>
            is a detestable thing in my opinion, and I think, indeed, in <lb/>
            that of every one else, who has any regard for equality and <lb/>
            the principles of justice that subsist among kinsmen."</p>
          <p>But his father, being afraid lest from his meeting with his <lb/>
            brothers there might arise some quarrel and disturbance <lb/>
            with them, inasmuch as they bore ill will against him on <lb/>
            account of the dreams which he had seen, sent them away <lb/>
            to keep their flocks at a distance, but retained him at home <lb/>
            till a fitting season, knowing that time is said to be a power­ <lb/>
            ful physician for all the passions and diseases of the soul, <lb/>
            and a remover of grief, and an extinguisher of anger, and a <lb/>
            healer of fear; for it softens and mitigates everything, <lb/>
            even such things as are, according to their own nature, <lb/>
            hard to be cured. But when he conjectured that no hatred <lb/>
            was any longer abiding in their hearts he sent this his son <lb/>
            forth to salute his brethren, and also to bring him word how <lb/>
            they and their flocks of sheep were.</p>
          <p>III. This expedition of his was the origin both of great <lb/>
            evils and also of great good, each of them being excessive <lb/>
            beyond all expectation ; for he, obeying the commands of his <lb/>
            parents, went to visit his brethren ; but they, seeing him coming <lb/>
            towards them while at a great distance, conversed one with <lb/>
            another, saying nothing of good omen, inasmuch as they did <lb/>
            not choose even to call him by his name, but called him a <lb/>
            dreamer, and a seer of visions, and such appellations as <lb/>
            these. And to such a height did they carry their rage that <lb/>
            (1 will not say all of them, but) the greater portion of <lb/>
            them plotted his death; and designed, after having slain <lb/>
            him, for the sake of not being detected, to throw him <lb/>
             <pb n="456"/>
            into a deep pit dug in the earth, for there are a great many <lb/>
            such places in that district dug as receptacles for the rain <lb/>
            water. And they were very near incurring that most ex­ <lb/>
            cessive pollution of fratricide, as they would have done if <lb/>
            they had not been, though with difficulty, persuaded by the <lb/>
            advice of their eldest brother, who counselled them not to <lb/>
            meddle with such a pollution but merely to cast him into <lb/>
            one of these pits, thinking then to contrive some means of <lb/>
            saving him, so that when they had all departed he might <lb/>
            send him back again to his father without having suffered <lb/>
            any harm. And after they agreed to this he came forward <lb/>
            and saluted them; and they took him as though he had <lb/>
            been an enemy, and stripped him of all his garments, and <lb/>
            let him down into a vast pit, and then, having stained his <lb/>
            cloak with the blood of a kid, they sent it to their father <lb/>
            on the pretence that he had been slain by a wild beast.</p>
          <p>IY. But on that day it happened by some chance that <lb/>
            certain merchants who were accustomed to convey their <lb/>
            merchandise from Arabia to Egypt were travelling that <lb/>
            way, and so the eleven brethren drew Joseph up out of the <lb/>
            pit and sold him to them; the one of them who was the <lb/>
            fourth in respect of age instigating this contrivance ; for in <lb/>
            my opinion, he was afraid lest his brother might be <lb/>
            treacherously slain by the others, who had conceived an <lb/>
            irreconcilable hatred against him, and therefore he pro­ <lb/>
            posed that he should be sold, substituting slavery for death, <lb/>
            the lighter evil for the greater. But the eldest, for he was <lb/>
            not present when he was sold, looking down into the pit, <lb/>
            and not seeing him whom lie had left there a short time <lb/>
            before, cried out and lamented loudly, and rent his clothes, <lb/>
            and tossed his hands up and down like a madman, and beat <lb/>
            his breast and tore his hair, saying, " What has become of <lb/>
            him ? Tell me, is he alive, or is he dead ? If he is dead, <lb/>
            show me his corpse that I may weep over his body, and so al­ <lb/>
            leviate my grief. When I see him lying dead I shall be com­ <lb/>
            forted ; for why should we bear ill will to the dead ? There <lb/>
            is no envy excited against those who are out of sight. <lb/>
            And if he is alive, to what country has he departed ? <lb/>
            Where is he kept ? for I am not, as he was, an object of <lb/>
            suspicion, so as to be distrusted by you." And when they <lb/>
            replied that he had been sold, and when they showed <lb/>
             <pb n="457"/>
            him the money which they had received for him, he said, <lb/>
            “ A fine trade, indeed, you have been driving ? Let us <lb/>
            divide the gain: let us wear crowns of victory after thus <lb/>
            rivalling the slave-dealers, and bearing off from them the <lb/>
            prizes of iniquity; we may well pride ourselves now that <lb/>
            we have surpassed them in barbarity, for they indeed <lb/>
            traffic in the liberty of strangers, but we in that of those <lb/>
            who are most nearly related to and most dear to us. <lb/>
            Surely here is newly contrived a great disgrace and a shame <lb/>
            which will be known far and wide. Our fathers left be­ <lb/>
            hind them in every part of the world memorials of their virtue <lb/>
            and excellence; we shall leave behind us the guilt of a <lb/>
            charge of faithlessness and treacherous inhumanity which <lb/>
            can never be effaced ; for the reputation of extraordinary <lb/>
            actions penetrates everywhere ; those which are praiseworthy <lb/>
            being admired, and those which are blameable meeting <lb/>
            with blame and accusation. In what manner now will our <lb/>
            father receive the news of what has happened ? You will <lb/>
            now, as far as depends upon us, have made the life of him who <lb/>
            has hitherto been wonderfully happy and fortunate, not worth <lb/>
            living; which will he pity, the child who has been sold, for his <lb/>
            slavery ? or those who have sold him, for their inhumanity ? <lb/>
            I am sure he will pity us much the most; since to do wrong <lb/>
            is a more terrible evil than to suffer wrong, for the one has <lb/>
            for an alleviation two consolations of the greatest influence, <lb/>
            hope and pity ; but the other is destitute of both these miti­ <lb/>
            gations, and is more unfortunate in the judgment of every <lb/>
            one. But why do I mourn and bewail in this manner? It <lb/>
            is better for me to be silent, lest I too should be treated in <lb/>
            some terrible manner; for ye are most merciless men in <lb/>
            your dispositions, and implacable ; and the rage which was <lb/>
            kindled in each of you is still furious and vehement.</p>
          <p>V. But when their father heard, not the truth indeed, <lb/>
            that his son had been sold, but a falsehood that he was <lb/>
            dead, and that he had been slain by wild beasts, he was <lb/>
            smitten in his ears by the news that was reported to him, <lb/>
            and in his eyes by what was shown to him (for they brought <lb/>
            to him his son's coat rent and torn and defiled with quanti­ <lb/>
            ties of blood); and being wholly bewildered by the exceed­ <lb/>
            ing greatness of the calamity, he lay for a long time without <lb/>
             <pb n="458"/>
            speaking, not being able even to lift up his head, the cala­ <lb/>
            mity overwhelming and completely prostrating him; then <lb/>
            suddenly pouring forth as it were a stream of tears with <lb/>
            bitter lamentations, he bedewed his cheeks, and his ehin, <lb/>
            and his breast, and all the garments on his chest, saying at <lb/>
            the same time sueh words as these, " It is not thy death <lb/>
            that grieves me, 0 my son, but such a tomb as has fallen to <lb/>
            your lot; for if you had been buried in your own land I <lb/>
            should have been comforted; I would have cherished you, <lb/>
            I would have tended you in siekness if you had died before <lb/>
            me, I would have given you my last embrace, I would have <lb/>
            closed your eyes, I would have wept over your dead body <lb/>
            lying before me, I would have buried you sumptuously, I <lb/>
            would have omitted none of the customary observances.</p>
          <p>"Again, even if you had died in a foreign land, I should <lb/>
            have said, nature has claimed what was due to, and what <lb/>
            belonged to her; and therefore, 0 my mind, be not east <lb/>
            down ; for living men have indeed their separate countries, <lb/>
            but the whole earth is the grave of the dead; and all men <lb/>
            are destined to a speedy death; for even the longest lived <lb/>
            man is but short lived if compared with eternity; but if it <lb/>
            was necessary that he should die violently and by treachery, <lb/>
            it would have been a lighter evil to me for him to have been <lb/>
            slain by men, who would have laid out his corpse, and have <lb/>
            pitied him so far as to scatter dust over him, and at least to <lb/>
            have concealed his body; and even if they had been the <lb/>
            most merciless of all people, what more could they have <lb/>
            done than have thrown him out unburied, and so got rid of <lb/>
            him ? And then perhaps, some one of the passers by on <lb/>
            the road, standing by, and beholding him, and conceiving <lb/>
            pity for our common nature, would have thought him <lb/>
            worthy of some care, and of burial; but now, as the saying <lb/>
            is, 0 my son, thou hast become a feast, and a banquet for <lb/>
            savage and carnivorous wild beasts, who will eat and devour <lb/>
            thy bowels ; I am compelled to endure distresses whieh I <lb/>
            never had imagined, I am without any cause practised in <lb/>
            enduring many miseries; I am a wanderer, a stranger, a <lb/>
            slave, living under compulsion, having even my very life <lb/>
            plotted against by those whom it least became to do so. <lb/>
            And I have seen many things, and I have heard many <lb/>
             <pb n="459"/>
            things, and I have suffered many things, all of which have <lb/>
            been incurable evils, which however I have learnt to bear <lb/>
            with moderation, so as not to yield to them.</p>
          <p>" But nothing has ever happened more intolerable than this <lb/>
            misfortune which has now befallen me ; which has consumed <lb/>
            and destroyed all the vigour of my soul; for what can be <lb/>
            a greater or more pitiable calamity ? The garment of my <lb/>
            child has been brought to me, who am his father; but of <lb/>
            him himself there is no portion brought, not a limb, not a <lb/>
            small fragment, but he has been wholly and entirely <lb/>
            destroyed and devoured, not being able even to receive <lb/>
            burial; and it seems to me that even his garment would <lb/>
            never have been sent to me at all if it had not been by way of <lb/>
            a reminder of my grief, and as a refreshment of my memory <lb/>
            as to the sufferings which he endured, so as to afflict me <lb/>
            with a never to be forgotten and never ending sorrow.</p>
          <p>He indeed bewailed his son in these terms ; but the <lb/>
            merchants sold his son in Egypt to one of the king's <lb/>
            eunuchs who was his chief cook.</p>
          <p>VI. It is worth while, however, after having thus explained <lb/>
            the literal account given to us of these events, to proceed to <lb/>
            explain also the figurative meaning concealed under that <lb/>
            account; for we say that nearly all, or that at all events, <lb/>
            the greater part of the history of the giving of the law is <lb/>
            full of allegories; now the disposition which we have at <lb/>
            present under consideration, is called by the Hebrews <lb/>
            Joseph; but the name being interpreted in the Greek language <lb/>
            means, " the addition of the Lord," a name most felicitously <lb/>
            given, and most appropriate to the account given of the <lb/>
            person so called; for the democratic constitution in vogue <lb/>
            among states is an addition of nature which has sovereign <lb/>
            authority over everything; for this world is a sort of large <lb/>
            state, and has one constitution, and one law, and the word <lb/>
            of nature enjoins what one ought to do, and forbids what <lb/>
            one ought not to do: but the cities themselves in their <lb/>
            several situations are unlimited in number, and enjoy <lb/>
            different constitutions, and laws which are not all the same; <lb/>
            for there are different customs and established regulations <lb/>
            found out and established in different nations; and the <lb/>
            cause of this the want of union, and participation existing <lb/>
            not merely between the Greeks and the barbarians, or <lb/>
             <pb n="460"/>
            between the barbarians and the Greeks, but also between <lb/>
            the different tribes of each of these respective nations.</p>
          <p>Then they, as it would seem, blaming those things which <lb/>
            do not deserve blame, such as unexpected occurrences or <lb/>
            opportunities, deficiency of crops, badness of soil, their own <lb/>
            situation either as being by the sea-side, or inland, or insular, <lb/>
            or on the continent, or anything of that sort, are silent as <lb/>
            to the real truth. The real truth is their covetousness, their <lb/>
            want of good faith towards and confidence in one another, <lb/>
            on which account they have not been satisfied with the laws <lb/>
            of nature, but have called those regulations, which have ap­ <lb/>
            peared to be for the common advantage of the agreeing and <lb/>
            unanimous multitudes, laws, so that the individual constitu­ <lb/>
            tions do naturally appear rather in the light of additions to <lb/>
            the one great general constitution of nature; for the laws <lb/>
            of individual cities are additions to the one right reason of <lb/>
            nature; and so also the man who is occupied with political <lb/>
            affairs is an addition to the man who lives in accordance <lb/>
            with nature.</p>
          <p>VII. And it is not without a particular and correct mean­ <lb/>
            in,, that Joseph is said to have had a coat of many colours. <lb/>
            For a political constitution is a many-coloured and multi­ <lb/>
            form thing, admitting of an infinite variety of changes in its <lb/>
            general appearance, in its affairs, in its moving causes, in <lb/>
            the peculiar laws respecting strangers, in numberless differ­ <lb/>
            ences respecting times and places. For as the master of a <lb/>
            ship collects together all the moans which may tend to <lb/>
            ensure him a favourable voyage with reference to and in <lb/>
            dependency on the changes of the wind, not always guiding <lb/>
            his vessel in one and the same way; and as a physician does <lb/>
            not apply one and the same means of cure to every sick <lb/>
            person, nor even to one person if his disease varies in its <lb/>
            character, but watches the periods of its abatement, and of <lb/>
            its intensity, and of its becoming full or empty, and the <lb/>
            alterations of the causes of the sickness, and so varies his <lb/>
            remedies as much as possible to secure the safety of his <lb/>
            patient, applying one remedy at one time and another at <lb/>
            another; in the same manner I conceive that the man <lb/>
            immersed in political affairs is of necessity a multiform <lb/>
            man, assuming many different appearances, one in time <lb/>
            of peace and another in time of war; and a different cha­ <lb/>
             <pb n="461"/>
            racter according as those who are opposed to him are <lb/>
            numerous or few in number, withstanding a small number <lb/>
            with vigorous resolution, but using persuasion and gentle <lb/>
            means towards a large body. And in some cases where <lb/>
            there is much danger, still for the sake of the common <lb/>
            advantage he will take the place of every one, and manage <lb/>
            the business in hand by himself; in other cases, where it is <lb/>
            merely a question of labour he will let others minister to <lb/>
            him as his assistants.</p>
          <p>It was appropriately said that the man was sold. For <lb/>
            the haranguer of the people and the demagogue, mounting <lb/>
            the tribunal, like slaves who are being sold and exposed to <lb/>
            view, is a slave instead of a free man, by reason of the <lb/>
            honours which he seems to be receiving, being led away by <lb/>
            ten thousand masters ? The same person is also represented <lb/>
            as having been torn by wild beasts; and vainglory, which <lb/>
            lies in wait for a man, is an untameable wild beast, tearing <lb/>
            and destroying all who give into it. And they who have <lb/>
            been purchasers are likewise sellers ; for there is one master <lb/>
            only to the citizens who live in any city; but there is a <lb/>
            multitude of masters, one succeeding another in a certain <lb/>
            succession and regular order. But those who have been <lb/>
            sold three times change their masters like bad slaves, not <lb/>
            remaining with their original ones, by reason of the speedily <lb/>
            satisfied irregularity of their dispositions, always thirsting <lb/>
            after novelty.</p>
          <p>VIII. This is enough to say on this part of the subject. <lb/>
            Accordingly, the young man, having been conducted into <lb/>
            Egypt, and there, as has already been stated, having become <lb/>
            the slave of a eunuch, gave in a few days such proofs of <lb/>
            virtue and excellence of disposition, that he had authority <lb/>
            over his fellow servants given to him, and the management <lb/>
            of the whole household committed to his charge ; for already <lb/>
            his master had learnt by many circumstances to perceive <lb/>
            that his servant in all his words and in all his actions <lb/>
            was under the immediate direction of divine providence. <lb/>
            Accordingly, in consequence of this opinion of his purchaser, <lb/>
            he was appointed superintendent of his house, apparently <lb/>
            indeed by his master, but, in fact and reality, by nature her­ <lb/>
            self, which procured for him the government of a mighty city, <lb/>
            and nation, and country. For it was necessary that one <lb/>
            who was destined to be a statesman should be previously <lb/>
             <pb n="462"/>
            practised and trained in the management of a single house­ <lb/>
            hold ; for a household is a city on a small and contracted <lb/>
            scale, and the management of a household is a contracted <lb/>
            kind of polity; so that a city may be called a large house, <lb/>
            and the government of a city a widely spread economy. <lb/>
            And from these considerations we may see that the manager <lb/>
            of a household and the governor of a state are identical, <lb/>
            though the multitude and magnitude of the things com­ <lb/>
            mitted to their charge may be different, as is the case too <lb/>
            with the arts of painting and statuary; for the good statuary <lb/>
            or painter, whether he is making many and colossal figures, <lb/>
            or only few and those of a small size, is still the same person, <lb/>
            and the art which he is practising is the same art.</p>
          <p>IX. But while he is earning a very high reputation in <lb/>
            the matters connected with the management of his master's <lb/>
            house, he is plotted against by the wife of his master, because <lb/>
            of the incontinent love which she had conceived for him; <lb/>
            for she, being maddened by the beauty of the young man, <lb/>
            and being unable to restrain the violence of her frenzy and <lb/>
            passion, addressed a proposal of illicit intercourse to him; <lb/>
            but he resisted it vigorously, and would not at all endure to <lb/>
            approach her, by reason of the orderly and temperate dis­ <lb/>
            position implanted in him by nature and habit. But when <lb/>
            she, inflaming and exciting her lawless desire, kept con­ <lb/>
            tinually tempting him, and continually throwing herself in <lb/>
            his way, and continually failing in her object, she at last, in <lb/>
            the violence of her passion, had recourse to force, and seizing <lb/>
            hold of his cloak dragged him vigorously towards the bed, <lb/>
            her passion endowing her strength with greater vigour, as <lb/>
            it often does strengthen even the weak. But he, proving <lb/>
            more powerful than even the alluring opportunity, uttered <lb/>
            a cry becoming a free man, and worthy of his race, saying, <lb/>
            What are you forcing me to ? We, the descendants of <lb/>
            the Hebrews, are guided by special customs and laws of our <lb/>
            own; in other nations the youths are permitted, after they <lb/>
            are fourteen years of ago, to use concubines and prostitutes, <lb/>
            and women who make gain by their persons, without restraint. <lb/>
            But among us a harlot is not allowed even to live, but death <lb/>
            is appointed as a punishment for any one who adopts such a <lb/>
            way of life. Therefore, before our lawful marriage we know <lb/>
            nothing of any connection with any other woman, but, with­ <lb/>
            out ever having experienced any similar cohabitation, we <lb/>
             <pb n="463"/>
            approach our virgin brides as pure as themselves, proposing <lb/>
            as the end of our marriage not pleasure but the offspring of <lb/>
            legitimate children.</p>
          <p>I therefore, having kept myself pure to this day, will not <lb/>
            begin now to transgress the law by adultery which is the <lb/>
            greatest of all sins, when I ought rather, even if ,in past <lb/>
            time I had lived in an irregular manner, and had been led <lb/>
            away by the impulses of youth, and had imitated the licen­ <lb/>
            tiousness of the natives, still not to seek to pollute the <lb/>
            marriage of another man, an offence which who is there <lb/>
            who would not avenge with blood ? For though different <lb/>
            nations differ in other points, still all agree in this alone, <lb/>
            that all men think him worthy of ten thousand deaths who <lb/>
            does so, and give up the man who is detected in adultery <lb/>
            without trial to the husband who has detected him. But <lb/>
            you, pressing me thus to load myself with guilt, would add <lb/>
            even a third pollution in my case, since you bid me not <lb/>
            merely commit adultery, but also to violate my mistress and <lb/>
            my master's wife, unless, indeed, this is to be looked upon <lb/>
            as the reason for which I entered your house, that I might <lb/>
            neglect the duties which a servant ought to perform, and <lb/>
            get drunk, and become intoxicated with hopes fit for my <lb/>
            master who has bought me, polluting his marriage, and his <lb/>
            house and his family.</p>
          <p>Nevertheless I am induced to honour him not merely as <lb/>
            my master, but also as one who has before now been my <lb/>
            benefactor. He has committed to my care the whole <lb/>
            management of his household; there is nothing whatever, <lb/>
            be it great or small, which is withdrawn from my superin­ <lb/>
            tendence, except you who are his wife. In return for these <lb/>
            kindnesses is it fitting for me to requite him with such an <lb/>
            action as you recommend to me ? I will rather, as becomes <lb/>
            me, endeavour with honourable service to requite the kind­ <lb/>
            ness of which he has set me the example, and which is due <lb/>
            to him. He, being my master, has made me, who was a <lb/>
            captive and a slave, a free man and a citizen by his great <lb/>
            goodness, as far at least as depended on him; and shall I, <lb/>
            who am a slave, compare myself to my master as if he were <lb/>
            a stranger and a captive ? And with what disposition can <lb/>
            I commit this unholy action ? and with what face can I be <lb/>
            impudent enough to look upon him ? The consciousness of <lb/>
            guilt which I shall have contracted will not suffer me to <lb/>
             <pb n="464"/>
            look him in the face, even if I should be able to be undis­ <lb/>
            covered, but in fact I shall never escape detection, for there <lb/>
            are innumerable witnesses of all the things which are done <lb/>
            privily who may not be silent. <lb/>
            I forbear to say that, even if no one else should know <lb/>
            it, or being privy to it should not divulge it, still I never­ <lb/>
            theless shall be a witness against myself by my complexion, <lb/>
            by my look, by my voice, as I said a little while ago, being <lb/>
            convicted by my own conscience ; and if no one else informs <lb/>
            against me, shall I not fear nor respect, justice the assessor <lb/>
            of God, and the overlooker of all human actions ?</p>
          <p>X. He put all these arguments together and philoso­ <lb/>
            phised in this way till she ceased to importune him; for <lb/>
            the desires are powerful, to cast in the shade even the <lb/>
            most powerful of the outward senses, which he, being aware <lb/>
            of, fled from them, leaving his garment in her hands, as she <lb/>
            had seized hold of him. This circumstance gave her an <lb/>
            opportunity to contrive a story, and to invent a plausible <lb/>
            tale against the young man, by means of which she might <lb/>
            revenge herself on him; for when her husband came from <lb/>
            the public assembly, she, pretending to play the part of a <lb/>
            modest and orderly woman, even among the intemperate <lb/>
            habits by which she was surrounded, said to him, with <lb/>
            excessive indignation, " You brought a servant into us, a <lb/>
            slave of the Hebrews, who has not only corrupted his soul, <lb/>
            since you, in a simple manner without due inquiry, com­ <lb/>
            mitted your household to him, but has even dared to assault <lb/>
            my body. For he was not contented with seducing only <lb/>
            his fellow servants, inasmuch as he has become a most <lb/>
            lascivious and debauched man, but he has attempted to <lb/>
            defile even me, his mistress, and to use force to me; and <lb/>
            the proofs of his insane lust are visible and clear ; for when, <lb/>
            having been very ill-treated by him, I cried out, calling to <lb/>
            my aid assistants from within; he fled, from fear of being <lb/>
            apprehended."</p>
          <p>And showing his garment, she appeared to give a proof <lb/>
            of the truth of what she said; and his master thinking that <lb/>
            it was true, ordered his officers to conduct the man to <lb/>
            prison, erring in two most important points : first, that with­ <lb/>
            out giving him any time to defend himself, he, without a trial, <lb/>
            condemned one who had done no wrong, as if he had com­ <lb/>
            mitted the greatest crimes; secondly, because the garment <lb/>
             <pb n="465"/>
            which the woman displayed as having been left behind bv <lb/>
            the young man, was indeed a proof of violence, but not of <lb/>
            that which he had committed, but rather of that which had <lb/>
            been offered to him, and of the fortitude with which he <lb/>
            endured it from the woman ; for if he had been offering <lb/>
            violence, it was probable that he might have laid hold of <lb/>
            the garment of his mistress ; but it was owing to his having <lb/>
            had violence offered to him that he was deprived of his own. <lb/>
            But perhaps he should be pardoned for his excessive igno­ <lb/>
            rance, inasmuch as he lived chiefly in the cook's house, <lb/>
            being filled with blood, and smoke, and ashes, his reasoning <lb/>
            having no opportunity to become tranquillized and to enjoy <lb/>
            leisure in itself, because it was confused still more, or, at <lb/>
            all events, not less than the body.</p>
          <p>XI. I have already sketched out three characters of the <lb/>
            man immersed in civil business ; that of him who is occupied <lb/>
            as a shepherd, that of the regulator of a house, and that of <lb/>
            the man possessed of fortitude : and we have now discussed <lb/>
            the two first of these sufficiently.</p>
          <p>But the temperate man is no less connected with the <lb/>
            regulation of political affairs than those two are; for tem­ <lb/>
            perance is a beneficial and saving thing for all the affairs of <lb/>
            life; and in affairs of state it is most especially so, as those <lb/>
            who wish to understand the matter may learn from nume­ <lb/>
            rous and easily obtained proofs. For who is there who does <lb/>
            not know that great calamities have befallen nations, and <lb/>
            districts, and whole countries all over the world, both by <lb/>
            land and sea, in consequence of intemperance ; for the most <lb/>
            numerous and most serious wars have been kindled on <lb/>
            account of love, and adultery, and the wiles of women; by <lb/>
            which the most numerous and most excellent portion both <lb/>
            of the Grecian and barbarian race has been destroyed, and <lb/>
            the youth of the cities has perished. And of the conse­ <lb/>
            quences of intemperance, are domestic seditions, and wars, <lb/>
            and evils upon evils in unutterable number. It is plain <lb/>
            that the consequences of temperance, are stability, and <lb/>
            peace, and the acquisition and enjoyment of perfect bless­ <lb/>
            ings.</p>
          <p>XII. It is worth while, however, to proceed in regular <lb/>
            order, and by this course to exhibit what is intended to be <lb/>
            intimated by'this figurative history. The man who brought <note type="footnote"> VOL. II. </note> <note type="footnote"> H H </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="466"/>
            this servant of whom we are speaking is said to have been <lb/>
            a eunuch; very naturally, for the multitude which pur­ <lb/>
            chases the services of a man skilful in affairs of state is <lb/>
            truly a eunuch, having in appearance, indeed, the organs of <lb/>
            generation, but being deprived of all the power requisite for <lb/>
            generating; just as those persons who have a confused sight <lb/>
            though they have eyes, are nevertheless deprived of the <lb/>
            active use of them, inasmuch as they are not able to see <lb/>
            clearly. What, then, is the resemblance of eunuchs to the <lb/>
            multitude ? That the multitude too is unable to generate <lb/>
            wisdom, but that it studies virtue ; for when a multitude of <lb/>
            men, brought promiscuously together from all quarters and <lb/>
            of different races, meets in the same place, what is said in­ <lb/>
            deed may be proper and becoming, but what is intended <lb/>
            and what is done is quite the contrary; since the multi­ <lb/>
            tude embraces what is spurious in preference to what is <lb/>
            genuine, because it is carried away by false opinion, and has <lb/>
            not studied what is truly honourable.</p>
          <p>On which account (though it seems a most unnatural <lb/>
            thing), a wife is represented as cohabiting with this eunuch ; <lb/>
            for the multitudes court desire, as a man courts a woman ; <lb/>
            for the sake of which it says and does everything, making it <lb/>
            its counsellor in everything which should and should not be <lb/>
            spoken, trifling or important, being not at all accustomed to <lb/>
            attend to considerations of calm wisdom; therefore the <lb/>
            sacred historian very appropriately calls him the chief cook. <lb/>
            For as a cook studies nothing beyond the insatiable and im­ <lb/>
            moderate pleasures of the belly, in the same manner the <lb/>
            multitude, which is occupied with public affairs, studies <lb/>
            only those pleasures and allurements which are conveyed by <lb/>
            means of the hearing, by which the energies of the mind are <lb/>
            relaxed, as one may say the nerves of the soul are in a man­ <lb/>
            ner loosened.</p>
          <p>And who is there who is not aware of the great quarrel <lb/>
            which exists between physicians and cooks; since the first <lb/>
            exert all their diligence and ingenuity in preparing things <lb/>
            which are salutary, even if they are not pleasant; but the <lb/>
            others, on the contrary, prepare only what is pleasant, dis­ <lb/>
            regarding what is advantageous ? Therefore, the laws which <lb/>
            exist among a people and those who govern in accordance <lb/>
            with the laws resemble physicians, and so also do those <lb/>
            counsellors and judges who have a regard to the common <lb/>
             <pb n="467"/>
            safety and security of the state, and who use no flattery to <lb/>
            the people. But the chief body of the younger men resem­ <lb/>
            bles cooks; for their object is not to supply what will be <lb/>
            beneficial to the people, but only to contrive for the present <lb/>
            moment to reap gratification.</p>
          <p>XIII. And the desire of the multitude, like an inconti­ <lb/>
            nent woman, loves the man who is experienced in state <lb/>
            affairs, and says to him: Go forth, my good man, unto the <lb/>
            multitude among which you are dwelling, and forget all <lb/>
            your own individual disposition, and the pursuits, and dis­ <lb/>
            courses, and actions in which you have been brought up. <lb/>
            And be guided by me, and attend to me, and do every <lb/>
            thing which is agreeable to me; for I cannot endure any <lb/>
            thing that is austere and obstinate, and foolishly fond of <lb/>
            truth, and pertinaciously adhering to justice, which puts on <lb/>
            an air of importance and dignity on all occasions, which <lb/>
            yields in no point, and never proposes to itself any object <lb/>
            but plain expediency, without any thought of gratifying the <lb/>
            hearers. And you do not know the innumerable calumnies <lb/>
            which some persons load you with, uttering them to my <lb/>
            husband and your master, the multitude; for up to this <lb/>
            time you appear to me to have been behaving like a free man, <lb/>
            and you seem not at all to know that you are the slave of a <lb/>
            very tyrannical master.</p>
          <p>But if you had understood that independence of action <lb/>
            belongs to a free man, but obedience to the orders of others <lb/>
            to a slave, you would then, laying aside your self-willed <lb/>
            obstinacy, have learnt to look upon me who am his wife, <lb/>
            being desire, and to do every thing with a reference to my <lb/>
            gratification, by which means you yourself also will receive <lb/>
            the greatest pleasure.</p>
          <p>XIV. But the statesman is not in reality ignorant that <lb/>
            the people has the authority of a master, but still he will <lb/>
            not admit that he himself is its slave, but looks upon him­ <lb/>
            self as free, and as entitled to consider mainly the gratifica­ <lb/>
            tion of the soul. And he will say in plain words: I have <lb/>
            not learnt to be a slave to the will of the populace, nor will <lb/>
            I ever study such a practice, but being desirous to attain to <lb/>
            the government and administration of the city like a good <lb/>
            steward or well-intentioned father, I will save it in a guile­ <lb/>
            less and honourable manner, without any hostile character. <note type="footnote"> H H 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="468"/>
            And while I cherish these sentiments I shall be open to <lb/>
            examination, concealing nothing, and not hiding any thing <lb/>
            like a thief, but keeping my conscience clear as in the light <lb/>
            of the sun and of day ; for the truth is the light.</p>
          <p>And I shall fear none of the evils with which they menace <lb/>
            me, not even if they threaten me with death; for hypocrisy <lb/>
            is in my eyes a more grievous evil than death. And why <lb/>
            should I encounter what I look upon in such a light ? For <lb/>
            even if the populace be a despot, am I therefore a slave, I <lb/>
            who am born of as noble ancestors as any one in the world, <lb/>
            entitled to be enrolled as a free citizen in the greatest and <lb/>
            most admirable state in this whole world ? For as I am <lb/>
            not influenced by gifts, nor by exhortations, nor by a love <lb/>
            of honours, nor by a desire of power, nor by insolence, nor <lb/>
            by a desire of seeming different from what I am, nor by <lb/>
            intemperance, nor by cowardice, nor by injustice, nor by <lb/>
            any other motive partaking of either passion or wickedness ; <lb/>
            what can, then, be the dominion of which 1 have need to <lb/>
            fear? Surely it can only be the dominion of men. But <lb/>
            they claim authority, indeed, over my body, but none at all <lb/>
            over me ; for I estimate myself by the more excellent part <lb/>
            of myself, namely, by the mind in accordance with which I <lb/>
            have determined to live, thinking but little of my mortal <lb/>
            body, which sticks to me like a limpet, and even if it is <lb/>
            injured by something or other, I shall not be grieved at <lb/>
            having got rid of cruel masters and mistresses who arc <lb/>
            settled within, inasmuch as I shall have escaped the most <lb/>
            formidable necessity.</p>
          <p>If, therefore, it shall be necessary for mc to act as a judge, <lb/>
            I will decide, neither adhering to any rich man for the sake <lb/>
            of his riches, nor gratifying a poor man by reason of my <lb/>
            compassion for his misfortunes, but putting out of sight the <lb/>
            rank and outward circumstances of those respecting whom <lb/>
            I am to judge, I will honestly pronounce in favour of what <lb/>
            shall appear to me to be just. And if I am called to counsel <lb/>
            I will bring forward such opinions as shall appear to me to <lb/>
            be for the common advantage, even though they may not be <lb/>
            palatable. And if I am a member of the assembly, leaving <lb/>
            flattering speeches to others, I will adopt only such as are <lb/>
            advantageous and salutary, reproving, admonishing, correct­ <lb/>
            ing, and studying not a frantic and insane license of speech, <lb/>
            but a sober freedom.</p><pb n="469"/>
            
          <p>And if any one dislikes improvement, let such a one find <lb/>
            fault with parents, and guardians, and teachers, and with all <lb/>
            who have the care of youth, because they reprove their own <lb/>
            children, or their orphan wards, or their pupils, and some­ <lb/>
            times even beat them ; and yet they are not to be accused <lb/>
            of evil speaking, nor of insolent violence, but on the contrary, <lb/>
            they must be looked upon as friends and real well-wishers; for <lb/>
            it would be utterly unworthy for me who am experienced in <lb/>
            affairs of state, and who have all the interests of the people <lb/>
            entrusted to me in discussions respecting what is for the <lb/>
            advantage of the commonwealth to behave worse than a man <lb/>
            would who has studied the art of a physician; for be would <lb/>
            not in the least regard the brilliant position or the accre­ <lb/>
            dited good fortune of his patient, nor whether he is of noble <lb/>
            birth or of large fortune, nor whether he is the most <lb/>
            renowned monarch or tyrant of all his contemporaries, but <lb/>
            would attend to one object alone, that, namely, of preserving <lb/>
            his health to the best of his power. And if it should be <lb/>
            necessary to use excision or cautery, he, though a subject, <lb/>
            or as some might say a slave, would cut or burn his governor <lb/>
            or his master.</p>
          <p>But I, who have got for my patient not one man but a <lb/>
            whole city sick with those more grievous diseases which the <lb/>
            kindred desires have brought upon it, what ought I to do ? <lb/>
            Shall I, abandoning all idea of what will be of general <lb/>
            advantage to the whole state seek to please the ears of this <lb/>
            or that man with an ungentleman-like and thoroughly <lb/>
            slavish flattery ? I would rather choose to die than to speak <lb/>
            merely with the object of gratifying the ear, and to conceal <lb/>
            the truth, disregarding all thought of what is really advan­ <lb/>
            tageous. " Now then," as the tragedian says: <lb/>
            " Now then let fire, let biting steel come on ; <lb/>
            Burn, scorch my flesh, and glut your appetite <lb/>
            Drinking my dark, warm blood ; for here I swear <lb/>
            Sooner shall those bright stars which deck the heaven <lb/>
            Descend beneath the earth, the earth itself <lb/>
            Soar upwards to the sky, than servile words <lb/>
            Of flattery creep from out my mouth to thee."</p>
          <p>But the people, when it is the master, cannot endure a <lb/>
            statesman of so masculine a spirit, and one who keeps so <lb/>
            completely aloof from the passions, from pleasure, from fear, <lb/>
             <pb n="470"/>
            from grief, from desire; but it arrests its well-wisher and <lb/>
            friend, and punishes him as an enemy, in doing which it <lb/>
            first of all inflicts upon itself the most grievous of all punish­ <lb/>
            ments, namely, ignorance; in consequence of which state it <lb/>
            does not itself learn that lesson which is the most beautiful <lb/>
            and profitable of all, namely, obedience to its governor, from <lb/>
            which the knowledge how to govern subsequently springs.</p>
          <p>XV. Having now discussed this matter at sufficient <lb/>
            length, let us see what follows next.</p>
          <p>The young man, having been calumniated to his master <lb/>
            by his master's wife, who was in love with him, and who <lb/>
            had invented against him the accusation to which she her­ <lb/>
            self was liable, is not allowed to make any defence, but is led <lb/>
            away to prison. And while he was in the prison he dis­ <lb/>
            played such exceeding virtue that even the most abandoned <lb/>
            persons there marvelled and were amazed, and looked upon <lb/>
            it as an alleviation of their calamities to have found such a <lb/>
            man as the averter of evil from them. And of the cruelty and <lb/>
            inhumanity of which gaolers are full there is no one who is <lb/>
            ignorant. For they are both by nature pitiless, and also by <lb/>
            constant practice they are made more and more brutal, and <lb/>
            increase in ferocity day by day, never seeing, or saying, or <lb/>
            doing any good thing, but committing only acts of violence <lb/>
            and barbarity. For as men who have very strongly knit <lb/>
            bodies, when besides their natural strength they add to it <lb/>
            the practice of wrestlers, become stronger still, and <lb/>
            acquire an irresistible power and a surpassing perfection of <lb/>
            body, so in the same manner when an untameable and <lb/>
            implacable nature adds habit to its natural ferocity, it <lb/>
            becomes inaccessible to, and immovable by any kind of pity <lb/>
            or any single respectable or humane feeling.</p>
          <p>And as those who associate with good men are improved <lb/>
            in their disposition by such association, rejoicing in the <lb/>
            pleasant and good persons with whom they are living; so <lb/>
            also do they who are living with the wicked take the impres­ <lb/>
            sion of their wicked ways ; for habit is a very powerful <lb/>
            thing to put a force upon nature, and to make it resemble <lb/>
            itself: now keepers of prisons live among thieves and <lb/>
            robbers, and housebreakers, and men of insolence and vio­ <lb/>
            lence, and murderers, and adulterers, and plunderers of <lb/>
            temples, from every one of whom they contract some wicked­ <lb/>
            ness, and collect a sort of contribution: and from their <lb/>
             <pb n="471"/>
            manifold mixture, make up one thoroughly confused and <lb/>
            wholly polluted iniquity.</p>
          <p>XVI. Nevertheless, even such a man as this was pro­ <lb/>
            pitiated by the virtue of this young man, and not only gave <lb/>
            him liberty and security, but even entrusted to him a share <lb/>
            of authority over all the prisoners ; so that in word, indeed, <lb/>
            and as far as the title went, he continued to be the goaler; <lb/>
            but in reality he had made over all the active part of the <lb/>
            work to the young man, in consequence of which conduct <lb/>
            of his the prisoners were benefited in no slight degree. <lb/>
            Accordingly they no longer thought fit to call the place a <lb/>
            prison, but a house of correction : for instead of tortures <lb/>
            and punishments which they had previously undergone night <lb/>
            and day, being beaten and bound with chains, and suffering <lb/>
            every imaginable kind of ill-treatment; they were now ad­ <lb/>
            monished with the language and doctrines of philosophy, <lb/>
            and also by the life and conduct of their teacher, which was <lb/>
            more effective than any discourse in the world; for he, by <lb/>
            placing his own life full of temperance and every kind of <lb/>
            virtue before them, as a picture and well-constructed model <lb/>
            of virtue, changed even those who had appeared to be <lb/>
            utterly incurable, so that the long diseases of their souls <lb/>
            now got a respite, since they were afflicting themselves for <lb/>
            what they had hitherto done, and were repenting of it, and <lb/>
            uttering such expressions as these, " Where was there all this <lb/>
            good formerly which we originally failed to find? For behold! <lb/>
            now it shines forth to such a degree that we are ashamed <lb/>
            to face it, seeing our deformity in it as in a looking-glass."</p>
          <p>XVII. AVhile they thenwere being improved in this manner <lb/>
            two of the king's eunuchs are brought into the prison; the <lb/>
            one being his chief butler, and the other his chief baker, having <lb/>
            been accused and condemned for malversation in the offices <lb/>
            committed to their charge. And Joseph took the same <lb/>
            care of them that he took of the others, praying that he <lb/>
            might be able to make all those who were entrusted to his <lb/>
            care in no respect inferior to irreproachable persons. And <lb/>
            when no long period had elapsed, he went to visit his pri­ <lb/>
            soners on one occasion, when he saw these eunuchs more <lb/>
            full of perplexity, and more downcast than they bad been <lb/>
            before ; and conjecturing from their excessive grief that <lb/>
            some strange event had befallen them, he inquired the rea­ <lb/>
            son of their sorrow. And when they answered him, that <lb/>
             <pb n="472"/>
            they were full of distress and perplexity because they had <lb/>
            seen dreams, and because there was no one who could in­ <lb/>
            terpret them to them, he said " Be of good cheer, and relate <lb/>
            them to me; for so, if God will, you shall be led to un­ <lb/>
            derstand them; for he is willing to reveal, to those who <lb/>
            are desirous of the truth, those things which are concealed <lb/>
            in darkness."</p>
          <p>Then the chief butler spoke first, and said, " I thought <lb/>
            that a great vine grew up, having three roots, and one very <lb/>
            vigorous trunk, and flourishing, and bearing bunches of <lb/>
            grapes as if in the height of autumn, and when the grapes <lb/>
            became dark and ripe I picked the bunches, and squeezed <lb/>
            the grapes into the king's cup, in order to convey to my <lb/>
            sovereign a sufficient quantity of unmixed wine." And Jo­ <lb/>
            seph, pausing for awhile, said, " Thy vision announces good <lb/>
            fortune to thee, and a recovery of thy former situation ; <lb/>
            for the three roots of the vine signify figuratively three <lb/>
            days, after which the king will remember thee, and will send <lb/>
            for thee from hence, and will pardon thee, and will permit <lb/>
            thee to resume thy former rank, and shalt again pour him <lb/>
            out wine for confirmation of thy authority, and shalt give <lb/>
            the cup into thy master's hand." And the chief butler <lb/>
            rejoiced when he heard these things.</p>
          <p>XVIII. And the chief baker, gladly receiving this inter­ <lb/>
            pretation, and rejoicing in the idea that he too had seen a <lb/>
            favourable dream (though his dream was of a very contrary <lb/>
            character), being deceived by the fair hopes which were held <lb/>
            out to the other, spoke as follows :—" And I, too, fancied <lb/>
            that I was carrying a basket, and that I was holding three <lb/>
            baskets full of cakes upon my head. And the upper basket <lb/>
            was full of all sorts of cakes which the king was accustomed <lb/>
            to eat; and there were in it confections and delicacies <lb/>
            of all kinds imaginable for the king's food: and the birds flew <lb/>
            down and took them from off my head, and devoured them <lb/>
            insatiably till they had eaten them all up ; and none of the <lb/>
            things which I had so skilfully prepared were left." But <lb/>
            Joseph replied, " I wish that the vision bad not appeared to <lb/>
            you, or that, having appeared, it had been concealed in <lb/>
            silence; or that, if any one would speak of it, he had done <lb/>
            so at a distance, so that I might not have heard him, and <lb/>
            that his account had been given out of the reach of my <lb/>
            ears, for I disliked to be a messenger of evil: for I sympa­ <lb/>
             <pb n="473"/>
            thise with those who are in distress, being greatly grieved <lb/>
            at what befalls them by reason of my own humanity. But <lb/>
            since interpreters of dreams are bound to speak the truth, <lb/>
            since they are interpreters of the divine oracles, and pro­ <lb/>
            phets of the divine will, I will explain your dream to you, and <lb/>
            conceal nothing; for to speak truly is in every case the <lb/>
            best thing, and is, moreover, the most holy of all holy <lb/>
            speeches.</p>
          <p>" The three baskets are a symbol of three days : and after <lb/>
            three days the king will command you to be crucified, and <lb/>
            your head to be cut off, and the birds will fly down and <lb/>
            feast upon your flesh, until you are wholly devoured." And <lb/>
            the chief baker, as was natural, was confused at this, and <lb/>
            cast down greatly, expecting the fate which was thus de­ <lb/>
            nounced against him, and being full of misery in his mind. <lb/>
            But when the three days had passed, the king's birth-day <lb/>
            came, on which all the natives of the country made an as­ <lb/>
            sembly and a feast, and especially those in the king's <lb/>
            palace. Therefore, while the magistrates were feasting, and <lb/>
            while all the household and all the servants were revelling <lb/>
            as in a public banquet, the king, remembering his eunuchs <lb/>
            who were in prison, commanded them to be brought; and <lb/>
            when he had seen them he confirmed the interpretation of <lb/>
            their dreams which Joseph had given, ordering one of them <lb/>
            to be crucified, and to have his head cut off, and restoring <lb/>
            to the other the office which he had formerly enjoyed.</p>
          <p>XIX. But the chief butler, after he was released, forgot <lb/>
            him who had foretold his release to him, and who had <lb/>
            alleviated all the misfortunes which had befallen him, perhaps, <lb/>
            indeed, because every ungrateful man is forgetful of bene­ <lb/>
            fits, and perhaps, too, because of the providence of God, who <lb/>
            designed that the prosperity of the young man should not <lb/>
            be owing to man, but rather to himself; for after two <lb/>
            years he, by means of a dream, and by two visions, pre­ <lb/>
            dicted to the king the good and. evil which was about to <lb/>
            happen to his land, each of the visions indicating the same <lb/>
            thing, so as to produce a firmer belief in them.</p>
          <p>For he thought that seven oxen were coming slowly up <lb/>
            out of the river, fat and very well fleshed, beautiful to look <lb/>
            upon, and that they began to feed by the river; after which <lb/>
            seven others, equal in number, destitute of flesh in a strange <lb/>
            degree, and very lean, came up, exceedingly ill-favoured, and <lb/>
             <pb n="474"/>
            they too fed alongside of the others. Then, on a sudden, <lb/>
            the better oxen were devoured by the inferior ones, and yet <lb/>
            those who ate them were in none, not even in the very <lb/>
            slightest degree, increased in bulk in their bodies, but were <lb/>
            still leaner than before, or, at all events, not less lean ; and <lb/>
            when he had awakened and gone to sleep a second time, he <lb/>
            bad a second vision appear to him; for he thought that <lb/>
            seven ears of wheat sprang up from one root, equal in mag­ <lb/>
            nitude, and that they grew and flourished, and rose up to a <lb/>
            height with great vigour; and then that seven other ears, <lb/>
            thin and weak, grew up near them, and the root with good <lb/>
            ears was devoured by the weak ears when they too had <lb/>
            grown up. Seeing this sight he remained sleepless all the <lb/>
            rest of the night, for cares stinging and wounding him kept <lb/>
            him awake, and at dawn he sent for the sophists and related <lb/>
            his dream; and as none of them was able, by any probable <lb/>
            conjectures, to trace out the truth, the chief butler came <lb/>
            forward and said, " 0 master, there is a hope that you may <lb/>
            find the man whom you are seeking; for when I and the <lb/>
            chief baker had done evil against you you ordered us to be <lb/>
            committed to prison ; and in that prison there was a servant <lb/>
            of the chief cook, a Hebrew, to whom both the chief baker <lb/>
            and I related some dreams which had appeared to us, and <lb/>
            be answered them with such felicity and accuracy of inter­ <lb/>
            pretation, that all that he foretold to either of us came to <lb/>
            pass, the punishment to the chief baker, which was ap­ <lb/>
            pointed to him, and I found you favourable and merciful <lb/>
            to me.</p>
          <p>XX. Therefore the king hearing these things, orders men <lb/>
            to go in haste and summon the young man before him; but <lb/>
            they having cut his hair, for the hair, both of his head and <lb/>
            of his beard, had grown very long while he was kept in <lb/>
            prison, and having given him a splendid garment instead of <lb/>
            a sordid one, and having adorned him in other ways, led <lb/>
            him before the king; who, perceiving from his appearance <lb/>
            that he was a free-born and noble man (for there are certain <lb/>
            outward characteristics which are stamped upon the persons <lb/>
            of some people whom one sees, which are not visible to all, <lb/>
            but only to such as have very clear-sighted eyes in their <lb/>
            mind), said, " My soul forebodes that my dreams will not <lb/>
            be altogether permanently hidden in uncertainty; for this <lb/>
            young man exhibits an appearance of, wisdom, by which he <lb/>
             <pb n="475"/>
            will be able to reveal the truth, and, as it were, dissipate the <lb/>
            darkness by light, and the ignorance of the sophists at our <lb/>
            court by his knowledge," " And then he related to him his <lb/>
            dream.</p>
          <p>But Joseph, without being at all dismayed at the rank and <lb/>
            majesty of the speaker, conversed with him rather as a king <lb/>
            with a subject than like a subject with a king, using freedom <lb/>
            of speech, though mingled with respect, and he said: God <lb/>
            has shown you before what he is about to do in your <lb/>
            country. Do not imagine that the two visions which have <lb/>
            appeared to thee are two different dreams ; they are but one <lb/>
            and the reduplication of them is not superfluous, but is <lb/>
            intended to produce the conviction of a firmer belief; for <lb/>
            the seven fat oxen, and the seven flourishing and vigorous <lb/>
            ears of corn, show seven years of great fertility and plenty; <lb/>
            and the seven lean and ill-favoured oxen which came up <lb/>
            after the fat ones, and the seven withered and shrivelled - <lb/>
            ears of corn, denote seven other years of famine; therefore <lb/>
            the first period of seven years thus denoted will arrive first, <lb/>
            having great and abundant fertility of crops, in which the <lb/>
            river will every year overflow all the land of Egypt with <lb/>
            inundations, and all the plains, as if they had never been <lb/>
            irrigated or fertilised before.</p>
          <p>And after these years there will come a period of seven <lb/>
            years entirely contrary to them bringing with it a terrible <lb/>
            want and scarcity of necessary things, during which time <lb/>
            the river will not overflow, nor will the earth be fertilised, <lb/>
            so that it will forget its former prosperity, and so that all <lb/>
            that was left from the former abundance of the crops will <lb/>
            be consumed.</p>
          <p>This then is the interpretation of the dreams which have <lb/>
            appeared to you. But there is something divine which <lb/>
            prompts me and communicates some suggestions to me <lb/>
            which may be salutary in this disease; and the most terrible <lb/>
            disease of all cities and countries is famine, which must be <lb/>
            checked or mitigated to some degree that it may not be so <lb/>
            exceedingly strong as to devour the inhabitants ; how'then <lb/>
            can it be mitigated ? That which shall be more than sum­ <lb/>
            cient of the crop in the seven years, during which the <lb/>
            plenty lasts, after having taken so much as is adequate <lb/>
            to the nourishment of the people, and that will be perhaps <lb/>
            a fifth part, must be stored up in granaries in the cities <lb/>
             <pb n="476"/>
            and villages, not removing the erops to any great distance, <lb/>
            but storing them in the countries to which they belong, and <lb/>
            keeping them there for the relief of the people who dwell in <lb/>
            each district; and it will be wellto bring together the crop <lb/>
            with the sheaves, not thrashing it out, nor winnowing, nor <lb/>
            sifting it at all, for four reasons.</p>
          <p>First of all, because if it is thus protected by the straw it <lb/>
            will remain uninjured a longer time; secondly, in order that <lb/>
            every year the people may be reminded of the former period <lb/>
            of plenty while they are threshing and winnowing ; for the <lb/>
            imitation of the former real blessings is calculated to pro­ <lb/>
            duee a second pleasure ; thirdly, in order to prevent any <lb/>
            exact calculation of the quantity stored up, as, while the <lb/>
            erop is in the ear and in the sheaf, it is of uncertain <lb/>
            amount and not easily to be described; that so the hearts of <lb/>
            the people of the land may not faint beforehand at the <lb/>
            consumption of what has been treasured up, but may use <lb/>
            with eheerfulness the nourishment of the eorn which is <lb/>
            thus provided for them, (for hope is of all things the <lb/>
            most strengthening), and so may to a certain extent feel <lb/>
            relief in the bitter disease of scarcity; fourthly, because in this <lb/>
            way fodder may also be provided for the eattle, as the straw <lb/>
            and the ehaff derived from the threshing of the wheat will <lb/>
            be of use to them in this way.</p>
          <p>And you must appoint a man to superintend all these <lb/>
            measures, of great prudence, and great aeuteness, and well <lb/>
            approved in all matters, who may be able without incurring <lb/>
            hatred or envy to do all that I have here described in a <lb/>
            proper manner, without giving to the multitude any reason <lb/>
            to suspect the impending famine; for it would be a sad <lb/>
            thing for them to anticipate their distress, and so to faint in <lb/>
            their souls through despair; and if any one should inquire <lb/>
            the reason of all this being done, the superintendent may <lb/>
            say that, as in peace it is right to provide things that may <lb/>
            be necessary in war, so also it is desirable in years of plenty <lb/>
            to provide against want; and that wars and famines are in <lb/>
            their nature uncertain, and in short so are all the different <lb/>
            events which befall men unexpectedly at different times; <lb/>
            for which therefore it is necessary to be prepared ; and not <lb/>
            when such things have befallen one, then to seek a remedy <lb/>
            when it is no longer of any avail."</p>
          <p>XXI. And when the king had heard these words, and had <lb/>
             <pb n="477"/>
            seen that the interpretation of the dreams did thus with <lb/>
            felicity and accuracy of conjecture arrive at the truth, and <lb/>
            that the advice which the young man gave appeared to be <lb/>
            of exceeding use in the way of providing against the uncer­ <lb/>
            tainty of the future, he ordered those who were about him <lb/>
            to approach nearer so that they might hear what he said ; <lb/>
            and then he spoke as follows: Can we, 0 men, find any man <lb/>
            equal to this man who has the spirit of God resting on <lb/>
            him ? And when they all praised his words, and raised <lb/>
            their voices in accordance with them, he looked on Joseph <lb/>
            as he was standing before him and said: The man whom <lb/>
            you advise me to seek out is near at hand; the wise and <lb/>
            intelligent man whom we have need of is at no great <lb/>
            distance; you yourself are he whom, in accordance with your <lb/>
            recommendation, we ought to seek for, for you do not appear <lb/>
            to me to have been inspired by anything short of God him­ <lb/>
            self, when you said what you have now said to me. Go <lb/>
            then, and take the superintendence of my household and <lb/>
            the government of all Egypt; and no one will blame my <lb/>
            indifference or easiness, as if I were yielding to indolence <lb/>
            and selfish love of ease, under this calamity so difficult to be <lb/>
            remedied; for great natures are often tested without requir­ <lb/>
            ing a long time for their examination, compelling men by their <lb/>
            intrinsic weight and power to be rapid, and to discard all <lb/>
            delay in receiving them, and some affairs do not admit of <lb/>
            any delay or procrastination when the occasions compel us <lb/>
            to necessary promptness of action.</p>
          <p>After speaking thus, Pharaoh appointed Joseph his <lb/>
            lieutenant in the kingdom, or rather, if one is to speak the <lb/>
            exact truth, actual king, leaving to himself only the name of <lb/>
            kingly power; but in reality yielding up the whole sovereignty <lb/>
            to him, and behaving in every respect so as to confer honour <lb/>
            on the young man. Therefore he gave him a royal seal, and <lb/>
            a sacred robe, and a golden circlet to go round his neck, <lb/>
            and he made him to ride in the second chariot which he <lb/>
            had, and commanded him in that state to go round the city, <lb/>
            a herald also going round with him, and announcing his <lb/>
            appointment to those who were ignorant of it. Moreover, <lb/>
            he changed his name with reference to his interpretation of <lb/>
            dreams, giving him an appellation according to the language <lb/>
            of the country, and he gave him for his wife the most <lb/>
             <pb n="478"/>
            beautiful and noble of all the women in Egypt, the daughter <lb/>
            of the priest of the sun.</p>
          <p>These things happened when Joseph was about thirty <lb/>
            years of age. And such is the end of pious persons; for, <lb/>
            even if they stumble they do not wholly fall, but rise again <lb/>
            after an interval, and are re-established in a firm and solid <lb/>
            manner, so as not to be completely prostrated. For who <lb/>
            would ever have expected that in one day the same man <lb/>
            would become a master from having been a slave, and from <lb/>
            having been a prisoner would rise up the most illustrious of <lb/>
            men, and that the under turnkey of the keeper of the prison <lb/>
            would become the king's lieutenant, and that he would <lb/>
            dwell in the king's palace instead of in the gaol, having the <lb/>
            highest honour in the whole land instead of being held in tho <lb/>
            greatest disrepute ? Nevertheless these things really did come <lb/>
            to pass, and similar things often will come to pass when it <lb/>
            seems good to God. Only let there be one single spark of <lb/>
            excellence and virtue implanted in the soul, and that must <lb/>
            some day or other be fanned into a flame and shine forth.</p>
          <p>XXII. But since we have proposed to ourselves to give <lb/>
            not only an explanation of the literal account given to us, <lb/>
            but also of its more figurative meaning, we must say what is <lb/>
            necessary to be said concerning that also. Perhaps now <lb/>
            some persons of rash and inconsiderate dispositions will <lb/>
            laugh; nevertheless, I will speak without concealing anything. <lb/>
            And I will say that the statesman is at all times an interpreter <lb/>
            of dreams, not classing him by this statement among the <lb/>
            charlatans and vain chatterers, and men who put forth <lb/>
            sophistical pretences by way of making money, or among <lb/>
            those who profess the explanation of visions which have <lb/>
            appeared to persons in their sleep in the hope of acquiring <lb/>
            gain; but I mean that the statesman is accustomed to in­ <lb/>
            terpret accurately the great, and common, and universal <lb/>
            general dreams, not only of sleeping but alsoof waking persons.</p>
          <p>And this dream, to speak the truth, is the life of man; <lb/>
            for as in the visions which appear to us in sleep, which see­ <lb/>
            ing we do not see, and hearing we do not hear, and tasting <lb/>
            and touching we do not either taste or touch, and speaking <lb/>
            we do not speak, and walking we do not walk, and while ap­ <lb/>
            pearing to exert other motions or to win other positions we <lb/>
            are not in reality in any such motions or positions ; but they <lb/>
             <pb n="479"/>
            are mere empty fancies without any truth in them of the mind <lb/>
            which fancies to itself a sketch; and makes to itself a repre­ <lb/>
            sentation of things which are not, as if they were; and in <lb/>
            like manner the fancies which occur to waking people re­ <lb/>
            semble the dreams of sleepers. They have come, they have <lb/>
            departed ; they have appeared, they have disappeared; before <lb/>
            they could be scarcely comprehended they have flown away. <lb/>
            And let every one who dreams in this way inquire within him­ <lb/>
            self and he will find a proof of these things within, and with­ <lb/>
            out any proofs from me he will know the truth of what I say, <lb/>
            especially if he happens to be at all an old man. He was at <lb/>
            one time an infant, and after that a child, and then a boy, <lb/>
            and then a youth, and subsequently a young man, and <lb/>
            then a man, and last of all an old man, but he was not <lb/>
            all these things at the same time. Did not the infant <lb/>
            disappear before the child, and the child before the boy, <lb/>
            and the boy before the youth, and the youth before <lb/>
            the young man, and the young man before the full-grown <lb/>
            man, and the man in the prime of life before the old man ? <lb/>
            and did not old age disappear in death ? Perhaps, also, <lb/>
            every one of the different ages of life yields in vigour <lb/>
            to the one which comes next to it, and so dies before its <lb/>
            time, nature by these means teaching us not to fear the <lb/>
            death which comes upon all men, inasmuch as we have found <lb/>
            it easy to bear the previous deaths, the death that is of the <lb/>
            infant, and that of the child, and that of the boy, and that <lb/>
            of the youth, and that of the young man, and that of the full <lb/>
            grown man, not one of whom exist any longer when old age <lb/>
            has arrived.</p>
          <p>XXIII. And are not all the other things, relating to the <lb/>
            body, dreams ? Is not beauty an ephemeral thing, wasting <lb/>
            away almost before it comes to its prime ? And is not <lb/>
            health an unsure thing by reason of the weaknesses which <lb/>
            lie in wait to upset it ? Again, is not strength a thing easily <lb/>
            destroyed by diseases arising from innumerable causes ? and <lb/>
            is not the accuracy of all our outward senses easily over­ <lb/>
            turned by the entrance of any vicious humour ? As to ex­ <lb/>
            ternal things, who is there who is ignorant of the uncer­ <lb/>
            tainty of them ? In one day vast riches have often come <lb/>
            absolutely to nothing ? Numbers of persons who have been <lb/>
            of the highest consideration, and who have enjoyed the <lb/>
            highest honours that the earth affords, have come into disre­ <lb/>
             <pb n="480"/>
            pute from causes which they neglected or despised. The <lb/>
            most mighty powers and authority of kings have been over­ <lb/>
            thrown, and have disappeared in a very brief moment of <lb/>
            time.</p>
          <p>There is an example to testify to the truth of my argu­ <lb/>
            ment in Dionysius, who lived at Corinth, who had been <lb/>
            tyrant of Sicily, and who, after he was expelled from his <lb/>
            dominions, took refuge in Corinth; and though he had been <lb/>
            so mighty a sovereign, became a schoolmaster. There is <lb/>
            another witness to the same point in Crcesus, the king of <lb/>
            Lydia, the wealthiest of all monarchs, who, having conceived <lb/>
            the hope of destroying the kingdom of the Persians, not <lb/>
            only lost all his men, but was taken prisoner, and was at <lb/>
            the point of being burnt alive. And there are witnesses of <lb/>
            dreams not only among men, but also among cities, and na­ <lb/>
            tions, and countries ; Greece is such, and the region of the <lb/>
            barbarians, and inhabitants of continents, and islanders, and <lb/>
            Europe and Asia, and the west, and the east; for absolutely <lb/>
            nothing whatever has ever remained in its original condi­ <lb/>
            tion ; but everything has in every particular been subject <lb/>
            to change. Egypt had once the supreme authority over <lb/>
            many nations, but now it is a slave. The Macedonians at <lb/>
            one time were so flourishing and powerful that they had ob­ <lb/>
            tained the supreme dominion over the whole world; but <lb/>
            now they pay yearly tribute, which is levied on them by <lb/>
            their masters, to the collectors of the revenue.</p>
          <p>Where is the house of the Ptolemies, and the glory of <lb/>
            all the individual successors of Alexander which at one time <lb/>
            shone over all the bounds both of earth and sea ? Where <lb/>
            is the liberty of so many independent nations and cities ? <lb/>
            On the other hand, where is the slavery of those which <lb/>
            were subject to them ? Did not the Persians at one time <lb/>
            reign over the Parthians ? and do not the Parthians now, <lb/>
            through, the changes of human affairs, and through the ex­ <lb/>
            traordinary and total alterations which are continually taking <lb/>
            place, rule over the Persians ? Some persons flatter them­ <lb/>
            selves with ideas of long and interminable prosperity ; but <lb/>
            they find that their good fortune is only the beginning of <lb/>
            great calamities ; and hastening forward as if to an in­ <lb/>
            heritance of good things, they find instead, terrible reverses; <lb/>
            and on the contrary it has often happened, that when they <lb/>
            have expected evil fortune they have met with good.</p><pb n="481"/>
            
          <p>Athletes, who have prided themselves on their personal <lb/>
            good condition, and power, and vigour of body, and who <lb/>
            have hoped to obtain an indisputable victory, have often <lb/>
            been either refused permission to contend for the prize at <lb/>
            all, not having been approved of, or else, after they have <lb/>
            descended into the arena, they have been defeated; while <lb/>
            others who have despaired of arriving even at the second <lb/>
            honours, have been crowned with the garland of victory, <lb/>
            and have carried off the first prize.</p>
          <p>Again, some persons setting sail in the summer (for that <lb/>
            is the season for fair voyages) have been shipwrecked; while <lb/>
            others, who have expected to be overwhelmed by reason of <lb/>
            being forced to put to sea, have reached their harbour un­ <lb/>
            injured, without having even incurred any danger. As <lb/>
            some merchants hasten forward as if to confessed gain, being <lb/>
            ignorant of the losses which are awaiting them ; while others <lb/>
            who have anticipated losses, have in effect met with great <lb/>
            profits—so very uncertain is fortune on either side, whether <lb/>
            for good or evil; and human affairs are as it were, weighed <lb/>
            in a scale, being lightened or depressed according as the <lb/>
            weights in each scale are unequal. And a terrible indis­ <lb/>
            tinctness and dense darkness is spread over human affairs. <lb/>
            And we wander about as if in a deep sleep, without being <lb/>
            able to arrive at anything with perfect accuracy of reason­ <lb/>
            ing, or to seize hold of anything with a firm and retentive <lb/>
            grasp ; for all things are like shadows and phantoms.</p>
          <p>And as in processions, what comes first passes by quickly <lb/>
            and escapes the sight; and as in torrents, the stream <lb/>
            which is hurried by outruns, by its swiftness and rapidity, <lb/>
            the comprehension of man, so likewise do the affairs of life, <lb/>
            being rapidly borne onwards, and passing by swiftly, appear <lb/>
            indeed, to be stationary, but in fact, do not stand still a <lb/>
            moment, but are continually being dragged onwards. And <lb/>
            men awake too, who, as far as the uncertain character of <lb/>
            their comprehensions goes, are in no respect different from <lb/>
            people asleep, deceiving themselves, think themselves com­ <lb/>
            petent to contemplate the nature of things with reasoning <lb/>
            powers which cannot err ; in whose case every one of their <lb/>
            external senses is a hindrance to knowledge, being hurried <lb/>
            by spectacles, and by peculiarities of flavours or odours, to <lb/>
            which they incline, and by which they are perverted, and in <note type="footnote"> TOL. II. </note> <note type="footnote"> I I </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="482"/>
            consequence of which they prevent any part of the soul from <lb/>
            being in a sound state, and from advancing without <lb/>
            stumbling as if along a level road. And humble pride, and <lb/>
            great littleness, and all other similar states which are made <lb/>
            up of inequality and anomaly, compel men to walk in a <lb/>
            sort of giddiness, and create great dizziness and per­ <lb/>
            plexity.</p>
          <p>XXIV. Since, then, life is full of all this irregularity, <lb/>
            and confusion, and indistinctness, it is necessary that the <lb/>
            statesman as well as the philosopher should approach the <lb/>
            science of the interpretation of dreams, so as to under­ <lb/>
            stand the dreams and visions which appear by day to people <lb/>
            who believe themselves to be awake, being guided by pro­ <lb/>
            bable conjectures and rational probabilities, and in this way <lb/>
            he must explain each separate one, and show that such and <lb/>
            such a thing is honourable, another disgraceful, that this is <lb/>
            good or that is bad ; that this thing is just, that thing is <lb/>
            on the contrary unjust; and so on in the same way with <lb/>
            respect to prudence, and courage, and piety, and holiness, <lb/>
            and expediency, and usefulness ; and in like manner of the <lb/>
            opposite things, with respect to what was not useful nor <lb/>
            reasonable, what was ignoble, impious, unholy, inexpedient, <lb/>
            pernicious, and selfish.</p>
          <p>Moreover, lie warns you in this way : is this something <lb/>
            belonging to another ? do not covet it. Is it your own ? use <lb/>
            it as not using it. Have you great abundance ? share it <lb/>
            with others; for the beauty of riches is not in the purse, <lb/>
            but in the power it gives one to succour those who are in <lb/>
            need. Have you but little ? do not envy those who have <lb/>
            much ; no one will pity a poor man who is always envious. <lb/>
            Are you in high reputation, and are you held in much <lb/>
            honour ? be not insolent on that account. Are you lowly in <lb/>
            your fortunes ? still let not your spirit be depressed. Does <lb/>
            everything succeed with you according to your wish ? fear a <lb/>
            change. Do you often stumble ? hope for good fortune here­ <lb/>
            after ; for the changes of human affairs are apt to be in a <lb/>
            direction opposite to the course they have formerly taken.</p>
          <p>The moon and the sun, indeed, and the whole of the <lb/>
            heaven has clearness bright and distinct, inasmuch as all <lb/>
            things are alike which exist permanently in the heaven; and <lb/>
            as they are all measured by the rules of truth itself, in har­ <lb/>
            monious order and in the most admirable agreement. But <lb/>
             <pb n="483"/>
            as for earthly things, which are full of great disorder and <lb/>
            confusion, they are inharmonious and discordant, to speak <lb/>
            with perfect correctness, so that dense darkness has over­ <lb/>
            taken some of them, while others resemble the most brilliant <lb/>
            light, or rather they are themselves the clearest and purest <lb/>
            of light.</p>
          <p>If, therefore, any one should wish to look closely into the <lb/>
            nature of things, he will find that heaven is everlasting day, <lb/>
            free from all participation in night or in any kind of shade, <lb/>
            inasmuch as it is surrounded uninterruptedly by a brilliant <lb/>
            display of inextinguishable and unadulterated light. And <lb/>
            in the same proportion as among us those who are awake <lb/>
            are superior to those who are asleep, so also in the universal <lb/>
            world the things of heaven are superior to the things <lb/>
            of earth; since the one enjoys an everlasting wakefulness <lb/>
            which knows no sleep, on account of its energies which <lb/>
            never stray, and never stumble, and which proceed rightly and <lb/>
            successfully in every thing; while the others are oppressed <lb/>
            by sleep, and if they wake up for a short time they are again <lb/>
            pulled down and buried in slumber; because they are unable <lb/>
            to look steadfastly and correctly at any thing with their <lb/>
            souls, but are always straying and stumbling. For they are <lb/>
            overshadowed by false opinions, by which they are compelled <lb/>
            to submit to dreams, and are always behind the real truth, <lb/>
            and are unable to comprehend any thing with a firm and <lb/>
            tenacious grasp.</p>
          <p>XXV. Moreover, Joseph is figuratively said to have been <lb/>
            mounted upon the second best chariot which the king had, <lb/>
            for the following reason. The statesman stands in the <lb/>
            second rank next to the king ; for he is not a private indivi­ <lb/>
            dual nor a king, but some one on the confines between the <lb/>
            two. Being indeed superior to a private individual, and <lb/>
            inferior in respect of authority to an absolute and indepen­ <lb/>
            dent king, having the people for his king, on behalf of whom <lb/>
            he has determined to do every thing with a pure and per­ <lb/>
            fectly guileless good faith; and he is borne as it were on <lb/>
            high in a well-built chariot, being lifted on high both by the <lb/>
            things committed to his charge and by the people, and <lb/>
            especially so when he contains in his mind every thing, <lb/>
            whether small or great, without any one ever opposing or <lb/>
            resisting him, but all being cheerfully governed by him <note type="footnote"> I I 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="484"/>
            under God to their own safety like sailors enjoying a fair <lb/>
            voyage.</p>
          <p>And the ring which the king gives him is the most mani­ <lb/>
            fest proof of confidence which the people, his king, places in <lb/>
            the statesman, and also of that trust with which the states­ <lb/>
            man relies on the people which is as powerful as a king. <lb/>
            And the golden circlet round his neck appears to indicate <lb/>
            figuratively both high reputation and punishment at the <lb/>
            same moment. For as long as all the affairs which concern <lb/>
            the administration of the state proceed prosperously as far <lb/>
            as he is concerned, he is proud, and is looked upon with <lb/>
            veneration, and is honoured' by the multitudes. But the <lb/>
            moment that any unforeseen mishap occurs to him, not <lb/>
            indeed intended, for such error deserves reproach, but <lb/>
            arising from pure chance, which always deserves pardon, he <lb/>
            is not the less dragged downwards by the ornament around <lb/>
            his neck, and is humbled, his master all but saying to him <lb/>
            in plain words, ',I, indeed, gave you this circlet to be around <lb/>
            thy neck, to be both an ornament while my affairs were <lb/>
            going on well, and a halter when they were proceeding <lb/>
            unfavourably."</p>
          <p>XX. Moreover, I have also heard people discussing this <lb/>
            passage with great apparent accuracy in a more figurative <lb/>
            manner and according to quite a different interpretation. <lb/>
            And their notion of it is this.</p>
          <p>They say that the king of Egypt means our mind: the <lb/>
            governor of the region of the body in every individual in us, <lb/>
            and who like a king claims the supreme power. And by <lb/>
            him when he has become devoted to the service of the <lb/>
            body three objects are especially laboured at as being <lb/>
            accounted worthy of exceeding care, namely, meat, and <lb/>
            sweetmeats, and drinkables. With reference to which fact <lb/>
            he also employs three persons to superintend the objects <lb/>
            aforesaid, his chief baker, and his chief butler, and his chief <lb/>
            cook. The one of whom presides over those things which <lb/>
            relate to eating, the second over those things which belong <lb/>
            to drinking, and the last to those sweetenings and sauces <lb/>
            which belong to the confections. And they are all eunuchs; <lb/>
            because the man who is devoted to pleasure is barren and <lb/>
            unproductive of every thing which is most necessary, such <lb/>
            as modesty, temperance, continence, justice, and every kind <lb/>
            of virtue. For there is no one thing so hostile to another <lb/>
             <pb n="485"/>
            as pleasure is to virtue, for the sake of which most people <lb/>
            neglect all those matters which alone it is worth while to <lb/>
            attend to, gratifying their unrestrained appetites, and sub­ <lb/>
            mitting to all the commands which they impose upon them.</p>
          <p>Therefore, the chief cook is not committed to prison at <lb/>
            all, nor does he fall into any misfortune, because his sauces <lb/>
            and sweetenings are not among the things which are very <lb/>
            necessary, not being pleasures but only provocations to <lb/>
            pleasure, such as are easily extinguished. But of the two <lb/>
            who are occupied in the employment of the miserable belly, <lb/>
            the chief baker and the chief butler, since eating and drink­ <lb/>
            ing are of all the things which are useful to life those which <lb/>
            have the greatest power to keep the being together, and <lb/>
            those who have the management of those things, if they <lb/>
            bestow great care upon them, do very justly obtain praise; <lb/>
            while, if they neglect them, they are thought worthy of anger <lb/>
            or punishment.</p>
          <p>But there is a difference in their punishments, because <lb/>
            the need of the two things is different; that of food being <lb/>
            the most indispensable, but that of wine not being very <lb/>
            useful; for men can live without any wine, using only the <lb/>
            pure drink of spring water. On which account there is a <lb/>
            reconciliation made with, and pardon bestowed upon, the <lb/>
            chief butler, as upon one who has erred in the least import­ <lb/>
            ant particular. But the offences of the chief baker admit <lb/>
            of no reconciliation and of no forgiveness, but incur an <lb/>
            anger which leads to death, as he has been guilty of wrong <lb/>
            in the most necessary matters; for want of food is followed <lb/>
            by death. On which account he who has erred on these <lb/>
            points very appropriately is put to death by hanging, suffer­ <lb/>
            ing an evil similar to that which he has inflicted; for lie <lb/>
            also has hanged, and suffocated, and stretched out the <lb/>
            famishing man by means of hunger.</p>
          <p>XXVII. This is enough to say on this subject. Accord­ <lb/>
            ingly Joseph, being appointed the king's lieutenant, and <lb/>
            having undertaken the government and superintendence of <lb/>
            the whole of Egypt, went forth in order to become acquainted <lb/>
            with all the natives, and investigated all the laws that were <lb/>
            established in the different cities, and caused a great affec­ <lb/>
            tion for himself to arise in the breasts of those who saw <lb/>
            him, not only because of the services which he conferred <lb/>
            upon every one of them, but also by the unspeakable and <lb/>
             <pb n="486"/>
            unrivalled graces of his appearance and by the courtesy <lb/>
            with which he associated with them. But when, in accord­ <lb/>
            ance with the interpretation of the dreams, the first seven <lb/>
            years of fertility arrived, he collected one-fifth of the pro­ <lb/>
            duce every year by means of his subordinate officers and <lb/>
            others who were employed under him in the public offices, <lb/>
            and by this means he collected such a vast quantity of <lb/>
            sheaves of corn as no one recollected as having ever existed <lb/>
            at any previous time. And the most evident proof of this <lb/>
            is that they could not possibly be counted, even although <lb/>
            thousands and thousands of persons were occupied in the <lb/>
            task, whose sole business it was to devote all their energies <lb/>
            to count them.</p>
          <p>And when these seven years had passed, during which the <lb/>
            plain of Egypt was fertile, the famine began, which, as it <lb/>
            proceeded and increased, was not confined to Egypt; for as <lb/>
            it became diffused, and from time to time extended, so as to <lb/>
            be always comprehending fresh cities and countries in suc­ <lb/>
            cession, it reached to the farthest borders of the land, both <lb/>
            in the eastern and western direction, so as to reach at last <lb/>
            over the whole world all around. Accordingly, it is said <lb/>
            that no general pestilence ever extended so widely, not even <lb/>
            that which the sons of the physicians call the creeping <lb/>
            pestilence ;” for that also attacks all parts at once, and pro­ <lb/>
            ceeding onwards rapidly like fire, utterly and completely <lb/>
            devours the whole mass of the ulcerated body. Accordingly, <lb/>
            they selected the men of the highest reputation in every <lb/>
            district, and sent them into Egypt to procure corn ; for <lb/>
            already the prudence of the young man was celebrated in all <lb/>
            quarters, who had thus provided abundant food against a <lb/>
            time of necessity. And he at first commanded all the <lb/>
            treasure-houses to be opened, calculating that he should <lb/>
            make the people more cheerful when they had beheld the <lb/>
            store that was provided, and that in some degree he should <lb/>
            be feeding their souls rather than their bodies on good <lb/>
            hopes. After that, by means of those to whom the office of <lb/>
            regulating the distribution of corn was committed, he sold <lb/>
            it to all who wished to buy, keeping a constant eye on the <lb/>
            future, and seeing what was impending even more clearly <lb/>
            than the present.</p>
          <p>XXVIII. And at this crisis, his father also,* since his <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xlii. 1. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="487"/>
            necessary food had by this time become scarce, not being <lb/>
            aware of the good fortune of his son, sent ten of his sons to <lb/>
            buy food, keeping the youngest at home, who was the <lb/>
            uterine and own brother of the king's lieutenant. And <lb/>
            they, when they had arrived in Egypt, met their brother as <lb/>
            if he were a stranger, and being amazed at the dignity with <lb/>
            which they beheld him surrounded, they addressed him with <lb/>
            prostration according to the ancient fashion, their dreams <lb/>
            now receiving confirmation and fulfilment. And he, when <lb/>
            he beheld those who had sold him, immediately recognised <lb/>
            them all, though he was not in the least recognised by any <lb/>
            one of them himself, since God was not yet willing to reveal <lb/>
            the truth on account of some necessary causes which at that <lb/>
            time it was better should be buried in silence ; and therefore <lb/>
            he either altered the countenance of their brother who <lb/>
            governed the country, so as to give him a more dignified <lb/>
            appearance, or else he perverted the accurate judgment of <lb/>
            the mind of those who beheld him.</p>
          <p>But he acted not like a young man who, being the lieu­ <lb/>
            tenant and magistrate invested with such extensive powers, <lb/>
            and having attained to the authority next to that of the <lb/>
            king himself, to whom the east and west looked up, and <lb/>
            elated with the pride of manhood and the vastness of his <lb/>
            authority, might, now that the opportunity of revenge had <lb/>
            presented itself, have shown his remembrance of the ill-treat­ <lb/>
            ment which he had received; but he bore what happened <lb/>
            with self-restraint, and governed his own soul, and with <lb/>
            great prudence feigned a perfect ignorance of and strangeness <lb/>
            to them, and both by his looks, and by his voice, and by all <lb/>
            the rest of his behaviour he pretended to be displeased at <lb/>
            them. He said to them, " My men, you say nothing peace­ <lb/>
            ful ; but some one of the king's enemies has sent you forth <lb/>
            as spies, and you, performing a base service for him, have <lb/>
            expected to escape detection. But nothing that is done <lb/>
            treacherously does escape detection, even if it be enveloped <lb/>
            in profound darkness."</p>
          <p>And when they endeavoured to make excuses for them­ <lb/>
            selves, they argued that he was accusing them of what had <lb/>
            never taken place, for that they had not come from a hostile <lb/>
            people, and that they were not themselves imbued with any <lb/>
            unfriendly feelings towards the people of the country, and <lb/>
            that they could never have been induced to undertake such <lb/>
             <pb n="488"/>
            an office as that of spies, for that they were by nature men <lb/>
            of peace, and that they had learnt, almost from their child­ <lb/>
            hood, from a most holy, and pious, and religious father, to <lb/>
            honour stability and tranquillity; and that their father was <lb/>
            a man who had had twelve sons, the youngest of whom, as <lb/>
            he was not yet of an age to bear a long journey, was remain­ <lb/>
            in,, at home, while we, whom you see here are ten more, <lb/>
            and the remaining one is not.</p>
          <p>XXIX. When he heard this, and heard those who had <lb/>
            sold him all speak of him as dead, what think you did <lb/>
            Joseph feel in his soul? for even if he did not utter the <lb/>
            feelings whieh then encompassed him, still they unquestion­ <lb/>
            ably were burning within his breast, and exciting, and kind­ <lb/>
            ling strange emotions within him; nevertheless, with deep <lb/>
            wisdom and humanity does he address them, saying, " If, <lb/>
            in good truth, you have not come hither to spy the land, <lb/>
            then, in order to prove your good faith to me, remain here <lb/>
            some short period, and write a letter and send for your <lb/>
            youngest brother, and let him come to you; or if, for your <lb/>
            father's sake, you are anxious to depart, lest he perehance <lb/>
            may be alarmed at your protracted <unclear>absenee</unclear>, in that case <lb/>
            depart all the rest of you, but let one of you remain behind <lb/>
            as a hostage, until you return again with your youngest <lb/>
            brother; and if you do not obey, then the most terrible <lb/>
            death shall be your punishment."</p>
          <p>He then threatened them in this manner, looking sternly <lb/>
            at them, and giving every sign of violent anger, as far as <lb/>
            appearances could go, and so he left them. But they, being <lb/>
            full of <unclear>eonseiousness</unclear> and depression, afflicted themselves for <lb/>
            their former treaehery towards their brother, saying, “* That <lb/>
            wickedness which we committed is the eause of all our pre­ <lb/>
            sent evils, since justice, whieh takes the regulation of all <lb/>
            human affairs, is now eontriving some punishment for us; <lb/>
            for having been quiet for a short time it is now awakened, <lb/>
            displaying its nature, which is at all times relentless and <lb/>
            implaeable towards those who are deserving of punishment, <lb/>
            and how can we deny that we arc deserving of it? We in a <lb/>
            merciless manner disregarded our brother when he besought <lb/>
            us and supplicated us, though he had done no wrong, but <lb/>
            had only, in the fulness of his natural affeetion, related to <lb/>
            us, as to his nearest relations, the visions which had ap­ <lb/>
            peared to him in sleep ; for which cause we, the most brutal <lb/>
             <pb n="489"/>
            and savage of men, became enraged, and committed (for we <lb/>
            must not now deny the truth) most impious actions ; there­ <lb/>
            fore let us now expect to suffer these things ahd even worse, <lb/>
            we who, though we are almost the only men in the whole <lb/>
            world who are called noble by birth, by reason of the ex­ <lb/>
            ceeding virtues of our fathers, and grandfathers, and ancestors, <lb/>
            have nevertheless disgraced our kindred, hastening to cover <lb/>
            ourselves with notorious infamy."</p>
          <p>But the eldest of the brethren, who also at the very <lb/>
            beginning had opposed them when they were originally <lb/>
            concocting their treachery, said to them, " Repentance is <lb/>
            useless after the thing has been done; I exhorted you, I <lb/>
            entreated you, pointing out to you how enormous the im­ <lb/>
            piety you were meditating was, I begged you not to in­ <lb/>
            dulge your passion; but though you ought to have assented <lb/>
            to me, you yielded to your own inconsiderate folly; there­ <lb/>
            fore, we now are reaping the fruit of your self-will and im­ <lb/>
            piety, and now the treachery which we exercised towards <lb/>
            him is required at our hands ; and he who requires it is not <lb/>
            man, but either God, or reason, or the law of God."</p>
          <p>XXX. The brother whom they had sold heard them <lb/>
            conversing in this manner without saying anything himself, <lb/>
            as he had hitherto spoken to them by an interpreter. <lb/>
            And being overcome by his feelings, he was unable to re­ <lb/>
            strain his tears, and turned away that he might not be <lb/>
            seen by them, and pouring forth hot and incessant tears, <lb/>
            and so, having relieved himself for a short time, he wiped <lb/>
            his eyes and returned to them, and commanded the second <lb/>
            in age of the brothers to be bound in the sight of them <lb/>
            all, since he, as it were, corresponded to himself, who was <lb/>
            the youngest but one ; for in a large number the second <lb/>
            corresponds to the last but one, as the first does to the last. <lb/>
            Perhaps too, he bound him because the greatest share of <lb/>
            the guilt belonged to him, as he was almost the original <lb/>
            author of the plot against him, and as it was he who ex­ <lb/>
            cited the others to the enmity which they displayed against <lb/>
            him; for if he had arrayed himself on the side of the <lb/>
            eldest when he gave his merciful and humane counsel, being <lb/>
            younger than he, but older than all the rest, perhaps, and in­ <lb/>
            deed most probably, the iniquity would have been checked, <lb/>
            in consequence of those who had the highest rank and <lb/>
            honour agreeing and co-operating together in the matter, <lb/>
             <pb n="490"/>
            which fact would have carried great weight with it; but <lb/>
            now, he, departing from the merciful and more excellent side <lb/>
            of the question, went over to the unmerciful and cruel <lb/>
            one, and putting himself forward as the leader of it, he in <lb/>
            this way encouraged those who were inclined to join him in <lb/>
            his audacious action, so that they unshrinkingly carried out <lb/>
            their nefarious purpose.</p>
          <p>This is the reason why he appears to me to have been <lb/>
            selected from the whole body for the purpose of being <lb/>
            bound. But the others now prepared for their return <lb/>
            home, since the governor of the country had given charge <lb/>
            to the officers to whom the sale of the wheat was en­ <lb/>
            trusted to fill all the bags of his brothers, as though they <lb/>
            had been strangers, and privily to replace in the mouths <lb/>
            of their sacks the money which they had brought, without <lb/>
            mentioning to any one that they had so restored it; and <lb/>
            in the third place, to give them also abundant food which <lb/>
            might be sufficient, and more than sufficient for them, on <lb/>
            the way, in order that the corn which they had bought <lb/>
            might be conveyed undiminished to their father.</p>
          <p>But while they were on their way, and expressing, as <lb/>
            was natural, their compassion for their brother who was <lb/>
            in prison, and being equally grieved also for their father's <lb/>
            sake at this second calamity which he was to hear of, his <lb/>
            flourishing family of children being thus diminished and <lb/>
            curtailed at every journey, and saying that he would never <lb/>
            believe that he was kept in prison, because those who had <lb/>
            been once stricken with misfortune are always dreading <lb/>
            a repetition of the same calamity, evening overtook them, <lb/>
            and having relieved their beasts of their burdens, they light­ <lb/>
            ened them, but received themselves heavier anxiety than <lb/>
            ever in their minds ; for in times of rest to the body, the <lb/>
            mind receives the impression made by unexpected events <lb/>
            more readily, so as to be very severely weighed down and <lb/>
            oppressed by them.</p>
          <p>XXXI. For one of them, having opened one of the sacks, <lb/>
            saw in the mouth of it his purse full of money ; and when <lb/>
            he had counted it, he found the whole price which he had <lb/>
            paid down for the corn restored to him ; and being amazed, <lb/>
            he brought it to his brothers ; and they, not imagining that <lb/>
            it was meant as a favour to them, but rather, suspecting <lb/>
            that it was a plot against them, were in great despondency <lb/>
             <pb n="491"/>
            and wishing to examine all their sacks, set off again for <lb/>
            fear of being pursued, and made all imaginable speed, al­ <lb/>
            most, as one may say, running without stopping to take <lb/>
            breath, and so they completed a journey which should have <lb/>
            taken many days, in a short time. Then, one after another <lb/>
            embracing their father, with copious tears, they all clung <lb/>
            to him, and kissed him ; and while he returned their em­ <lb/>
            braces, although his soul speedily began to forebode some <lb/>
            new calamity, for while they were thus approaching and <lb/>
            saluting him he perceived the absence of the son who was <lb/>
            left behind, and in his own mind blamed him for his slowness <lb/>
            in being behind the others ; for he was looking at them <lb/>
            as they came in, being anxious to behold the number of <lb/>
            his children complete.</p>
          <p>But when no one from without came in besides, they, <lb/>
            seeing that he was in a state of agitated suspense, said, <lb/>
            “ 0 my father! doubt is worse than even the certain <lb/>
            knowledge of unexpected calamities; for when one is cer­ <lb/>
            tainly apprised of such, one may discover a road to safety : <lb/>
            but ignorance and doubt are the cause of error and per­ <lb/>
            plexity ; listen then, to the sad story which we have to <lb/>
            tell, but which still must be told.</p>
          <p>" The brother whom you sent along with us to buy <lb/>
            corn, and who has not returned with us, is alive; for we <lb/>
            must release you from the more terrible apprehension that <lb/>
            he may be dead ; but he is alive, and is remaining in Egypt <lb/>
            with the governor of the country, who, whether it be from <lb/>
            any false accusation which has been laid against us, or <lb/>
            from any suspicion which he has himself conceived, charged <lb/>
            us with being spies. And when we said all that the time <lb/>
            would allow us to say in our defence, and mentioned you <lb/>
            as being our father, and the brothers who were not of our <lb/>
            company, one of them being dead, and the other remain­ <lb/>
            ing with you, who we said tarried behind at home on <lb/>
            account of his age, inasmuch as he was still a child, making <lb/>
            known and revealing to him all the circumstances of our <lb/>
            family by reason of our absence of all suspicion, we availed <lb/>
            nothing; but he said, that the only proof that could be <lb/>
            given him of our truth and honesty would be the coming <lb/>
            of our youngest brother to see him; for which reason he <lb/>
            also detained the second of us, as a pledge and surety for <lb/>
            his coming. Therefore his command is most grievous to <lb/>
             <pb n="492"/>
            us. But the occasion is also more imperious than even <lb/>
            his command, which we must necessarily submit to from <lb/>
            our want of necessaries, since Egypt is the only country <lb/>
            which can supply us, who are thus oppressed by famine, <lb/>
            with necessary food."</p>
          <p>XXXII. But he, groaning most bitterly, said, " Whom <lb/>
            shall I lament first ? the youngest but one, who was not <lb/>
            the last, but the first to encounter the series of disasters <lb/>
            which has befallen our family ? or the second, on whom <lb/>
            the second evil has fallen, namely, captivity, which is only <lb/>
            inferior in misery to death ? or the youngest, who is now <lb/>
            to undertake that most detestable journey, since go he must, <lb/>
            without being warned by the calamities which have be­ <lb/>
            fallen his brethren ? and I, torn to pieces as to all my <lb/>
            limbs and all my parts (for children are the limbs of their <lb/>
            parents), am in danger of becoming utterly childless who <lb/>
            was so short a time ago accounted happy in the number <lb/>
            and excellence of my children."</p>
          <p>But the eldest replied, " I give you my two sons as <lb/>
            hostages, the only children that I have, slay them if I bring <lb/>
            not back again to you, safe and sound, the brother whom <lb/>
            you entrust to my hand, and who, by his visit to Egypt, <lb/>
            will effect two things of the greatest importance for us ; <lb/>
            first, he will give a most evident proof that we are not <lb/>
            spies and enemies; and, secondly, he will enable us to <lb/>
            recover our brother, whom we have left in captivity."</p>
          <p>But as his father was much grieved and said that he did <lb/>
            not know what to do, because while he had but two sons of <lb/>
            one mother, one of them was now dead, and the other was <lb/>
            left desolate and almost alone, so that he dreaded the <lb/>
            journey, and though alive would die from fear before he <lb/>
            could accomplish it, from a recollection of those fearful <lb/>
            events which his elder brother had encountered; while he <lb/>
            was speaking thus, the brethren put forward as their spokes­ <lb/>
            man him who was the boldest among them, and by his nature <lb/>
            inclined to take the lead, and who was eloquent in speech, <lb/>
            and he said what seemed good to them all; for they agreed, <lb/>
            as their necessary food was falling short, for the corn which <lb/>
            they had previously bought was now exhausted, and as the <lb/>
            famine was again pressing upon and overwhelming them, to <lb/>
            go for more in one united body, but not to go at all if the <lb/>
            youngest still remained behind; because the governor of the <lb/>
             <pb n="493"/>
            country had forbidden them to appear before him without <lb/>
            him.</p>
          <p>And their father, calculating like a wise man that it was <lb/>
            better to expose one son to the uncertain and doubtful <lb/>
            danger of the future, than to encounter the certain loss of <lb/>
            so large a family, which the whole house must endure if they <lb/>
            continued to be overwhelmed by the present scarcity, that <lb/>
            most incurable of diseases, says to them, " But if the neces­ <lb/>
            sity which presses upon us is more powerful than my wishes, <lb/>
            we must yield: for perhaps, perhaps I say, nature may be <lb/>
            devising something better which she does not choose as yet <lb/>
            to reveal to our minds. Depart, therefore, taking with you <lb/>
            your youngest brother as you have determined; but do not <lb/>
            go in the same manner as ye went in before. For formerly <lb/>
            you had only need of money to buy corn, since no one knew <lb/>
            you, and since you had not at that time suffered any in­ <lb/>
            tolerable calamity. But now you require presents also; for <lb/>
            three reasons. First of all, to propitiate the governor and <lb/>
            dispenser of corn, to whom you say that you are known. <lb/>
            Secondly, in order that so you may the more speedily recover <lb/>
            him who is held in captivity, by thus paying down a large <lb/>
            ransom for him. And thirdly, for the sake of as far as <lb/>
            possible removing any idea of your being spies. Therefore, <lb/>
            taking presents of all that our land supplies, offer them to <lb/>
            the man as a kind of first fruits, and take double money, <lb/>
            both that which you paid before, for perhaps it was restored <lb/>
            to you through the oversight of some one, and also another <lb/>
            sum sufficient to buy corn; and take with you also my <lb/>
            prayer, which we offer to God our Saviour, that you who are <lb/>
            strangers may go acceptably to the natives of the country, <lb/>
            and that you may return in safety, giving back to your <lb/>
            father those necessary pledges, his children, and bringing <lb/>
            back the brother whom you have left in bondage, and also <lb/>
            the youngest, as yet unacquainted with trouble, whom you <lb/>
            are now taking with you." And so they took their departure <lb/>
            and hastened towards Egypt.</p>
          <p>XXXIII. Then a few days afterwards they arrived in <lb/>
            Egypt, and when the governor of the country saw them he <lb/>
            was greatly pleased, and ordered the steward of his house <lb/>
            to prepare a sumptuous dinner, and to bring the men in <lb/>
            that they might partake of his salt and of his table. And <lb/>
            when they were brought in to dinner they were in a state <lb/>
             <pb n="494"/>
            of great suspense, as not knowing what would be done with <lb/>
            them, and were in confusion, suspecting that they might <lb/>
            perhaps have a false accusation of theft brought against <lb/>
            them on the ground of their having taken away the price of <lb/>
            the corn that they had bought and which they had found in <lb/>
            their sacks, as if they had done so wilfully. So then they <lb/>
            came up to the steward of the house, and made a defence on <lb/>
            a subject on which no one ventured to accuse them, purging <lb/>
            their consciences, and, at the same time, displaying the <lb/>
            money which they had brought back and offering to return <lb/>
            it. But he cheered them with favourable and humane lan­ <lb/>
            guage, saying, " There is no one so impious as to found a <lb/>
            false accusation on the graces of God, who is all-merciful. He <lb/>
            it is who has rained treasures into your sacks, giving you <lb/>
            not only food but also riches out of his abundant store." <lb/>
            So they being comforted, then arranged in order the presents <lb/>
            which they had brought from home to display them to the <lb/>
            governor. And when the master of the house came in they <lb/>
            offered them to him. And when he had inquired of them <lb/>
            how they were, and whether their father, of whom they had <lb/>
            previously spoken, was still alive, they answered nothing <lb/>
            concerning themselves, but concerning their father they <lb/>
            replied that he was alive and well. And when he had prayed <lb/>
            for him, and addressed them in the most favourable and <lb/>
            God-fearing manner, looking upon his brother by the same <lb/>
            mother, when he saw him he could not restrain his tears, <lb/>
            but being now overcome by his feelings, he turned himself <lb/>
            about before he made himself known to them, and going out <lb/>
            on a pretext as if some urgent cause compelled him (for it <lb/>
            was not a favourable opportunity for him to tell them the <lb/>
            truth), he wept in a secret chamber of his house and poured <lb/>
            forth abundance of tears.</p>
          <p>XXXIV. Then when he had washed his hands he re­ <lb/>
            strained his sorrow by the power of reason, and coming back <lb/>
            again he feasted the strangers, returning to them the brother <lb/>
            who had come with them before, and who had been kept as a <lb/>
            hostage for the. appearance of the youngest. And with them <lb/>
            there also feasted others of the nobles of the Egyptians. <lb/>
            And the manner of their entertainment was to each party <lb/>
            in accordance with their national customs, since Joseph <lb/>
            thought it wrong to overturn ancient laws, and especially at <lb/>
            a banquet where the pleasures should be more numerous than <lb/>
             <pb n="495"/>
            the annoyances. And as he commanded them all to sit <lb/>
            down in order according to their age, as the men had not <lb/>
            yet learnt the fashion of lying down on occasions of banquet­ <lb/>
            ing, they marvelled to see whether the Egyptians would <lb/>
            adopt the same habits as the Hebrews, having a regard to <lb/>
            regular order, and knowing how to distinguish between the <lb/>
            honours due to the eldest and the youngest. Perhaps, too, <lb/>
            they thought this man who manages all the common business <lb/>
            of the house, because the country has hitherto been less <lb/>
            refined in matters relating to eating, has now not only in­ <lb/>
            troduced regularity and good order into great matters, by <lb/>
            which the affairs of peace and war are accustomed to be <lb/>
            brought to a successful issue, but also into those things <lb/>
            which are usually accounted of less importance, most of <lb/>
            which, indeed, refer mainly to amusement. For the object <lb/>
            of banquets is cheerfulness, and they do not at all allow the <lb/>
            guests to be too solemn and austere-looking.</p>
          <p>While they were praising the arrangements of the feast <lb/>
            in this quiet way, tables are brought indeed, of no great <lb/>
            costliness or luxury, as, by reason of the famine, their host <lb/>
            did not think it proper to revel too much amid the distresses <lb/>
            of others; and they, like men of sense and understanding, <lb/>
            praised this part of his conduct also, because he had thus avoid­ <lb/>
            ed an unseemly magnificence, which is a thing calculated to <lb/>
            provoke envy, saying that he was maintaining the character <lb/>
            at the same time of one who sympathised with the needy, and <lb/>
            also of a liberal entertainer, placing himself between the two, <lb/>
            and avoiding all cause for blaming him in either particular. <lb/>
            Therefore his preparations for the entertainment escaped all <lb/>
            ill-will being suited to the time, and what was wanting was <lb/>
            made up by continual cheerfulness, and by pledging one <lb/>
            another in wine, and by good wishes, and by exhortations to <lb/>
            eat what there was, which to persons of gentleman-like and <lb/>
            accomplished minds was more pleasant than all the sump­ <lb/>
            tuous dishes and liquors which men fond of eating and of <lb/>
            epicurism provide for eating and drinking, which are in <lb/>
            reality deserving of no serious care, but by which they do <lb/>
            in truth display their little-mindedness with great pomp.</p>
          <p>XXXV. And on the next day he sent, the first thing in <lb/>
            the morning, for the steward of his household, and com­ <lb/>
            manded him to fill all the sacks of the men which they had <lb/>
            brought with them with corn, and a second time to put <lb/>
             <pb n="496"/>
            back in the mouths of their sacks the price which they had <lb/>
            brought with them, and to put in the sack of the youngest <lb/>
            the most beautiful of his silver cups out of which lie himself <lb/>
            was accustomed to drink; and he cheerfully did as he was <lb/>
            commanded, taking care that no one was a witness of his <lb/>
            actions. And they, not knowing any of the things which <lb/>
            had been done thus secretly, departed, rejoicing in all the <lb/>
            good fortune which had befallen them beyond all their ex­ <lb/>
            pectations ; for what they had expected was this, to have a <lb/>
            false accusation laid against them, as if they had stolen the <lb/>
            money which had been restored to them, and never to <lb/>
            recover their brother whom they had left as a hostage, and <lb/>
            perhaps also, besides that, to lose their youngest brother who <lb/>
            would be seized upon by force by the man who had been so <lb/>
            determined that he should be brought.</p>
          <p>But what had happened to them was better than their <lb/>
            most sanguine prayers, since, in addition to having no <lb/>
            false accusations laid against them, they had also been ad­ <lb/>
            mitted to the bread and salt of the governor, which among <lb/>
            all men is a token of genuine friendship, and had also <lb/>
            recovered their brother without his having received any <lb/>
            injury, without having had recourse to the intercession and <lb/>
            entreaty of any mediator, and were also taking back their <lb/>
            youngest brother in safety to their father, having escaped all <lb/>
            suspicion of being spies, and bearing with them an abundant <lb/>
            quantity of food, and having good and well-founded hopes <lb/>
            for the future, for they thought that even if necessary food <lb/>
            was repeatedly to fail them, they should never again them­ <lb/>
            selves be in exceeding want as before, but might return joy­ <lb/>
            fully to the governor of the country as to a friend and not <lb/>
            a stranger.</p>
          <p>XXXVI. But while they were feeling disposed in this way, <lb/>
            and revolving such thoughts in their souls, a sudden and <lb/>
            unexpected confusion came upon them, for the steward of <lb/>
            the household, being commanded to do so, ran after them <lb/>
            as if to attack them, bringing with him a vast multitude of <lb/>
            servants, waving his hands, and making signs to them to <lb/>
            stop, and then coming up to them out of breath he said, " You <lb/>
            have now set the seal to all the accusations that have been <lb/>
            brought against you ; you have returned evil for good, and <lb/>
            turned back upon the same road of iniquity as before; you <lb/>
            have not only stolen and carried off the price of the corn, <lb/>
             <pb n="497"/>
            but you have committed even a greater offence than that, <lb/>
            for wickedness which has obtained forgiveness gets more <lb/>
            shameless; you, you very grateful and very peaceful men, <lb/>
            have stolen the most beautiful and most valuable drinking <lb/>
            cup belonging to my master, the very cup in which he <lb/>
            pledged you; you who did not even know what was meant <lb/>
            by the name of spy, and who brought back double money <lb/>
            to restore that which you had previously paid and professed <lb/>
            to have found in your sacks,-a trick, as it should seem, <lb/>
            and a bait to enable you to catch and snare a more valuable <lb/>
            prize ; but wickedness does not always prosper, but though <lb/>
            always endeavouring to escape notice it is detected."</p>
          <p>While he was running on in this way against them they <lb/>
            stood motionless and speechless, those most grievous of all <lb/>
            evils, sorrow and fear, falling upon them thus suddenly, so <lb/>
            that they were unable even to open their mouths, for the <lb/>
            advent of unexpected evils makes even those who are elo­ <lb/>
            quent actually speechless ; but at length they recovered <lb/>
            themselves, and lest they should seem to be silent, because <lb/>
            they were self-convicted by their own consciences, they <lb/>
            spoke and said, " How shall we reply and defend ourselves, <lb/>
            and to whom ? for you who are our accuser are going to be <lb/>
            our judge also; you, who even if others had accused us <lb/>
            ought to have been our advocate from the experience that <lb/>
            you have already had of us. The money which on the <lb/>
            former occasion we found replaced in our sacks, we brought <lb/>
            back again in order to restore it, though no one had con­ <lb/>
            victed us of having received it again, and do you suppose <lb/>
            that after that we became so completely changed as to <lb/>
            requite our entertainer with injury and theft ? This was <lb/>
            not so; and never let it enter your mind that we have done <lb/>
            any such thing; but whichever of us brethren is found to <lb/>
            have the cup let him die the death; for if any such wicked <lb/>
            deed has been done there are many reasons why we should <lb/>
            suffer death in atonement of it; in the first place, because <lb/>
            covetousness and a desire for the property of others is a <lb/>
            most wicked thing; secondly, because to attempt to injure <lb/>
            those who have done one good is a most impious action; <lb/>
            thirdly, because for men who are proud of the nobility of <lb/>
            their birth to dare to destroy the reputation of their ances­ <lb/>
            tors by scandalous actions of their own is a most shameful <note type="footnote"> VOL. II. </note> <note type="footnote"> K K </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="498"/>
            disgrace; and since if any one of us has stolen the cup of the <lb/>
            governor he is liable to all these reproaches, let him die as <lb/>
            one who has performed actions worthy of ten thousand <lb/>
            deaths."</p>
          <p>XXXVII. And while speaking thus they unloose the <lb/>
            burdens from off their beasts and take them down, and <lb/>
            encourage the steward with all diligence to search them, <lb/>
            and to look for the cup, and he, not being unaware that it <lb/>
            was lying in the sack of the youngest, inasmuch as he <lb/>
            himself had secretly placed it there, behaved cunningly, and <lb/>
            began with the eldest, and so went on in regular order, <lb/>
            taking them according to their ages, and searching, while <lb/>
            each willingly brought forward his sack and displayed its <lb/>
            contents, till he came to the last, in whose possession the <lb/>
            sought-for cup was found, so that they all when they saw it <lb/>
            lifted up their voices, and lamented, and rent their clothes, <lb/>
            groaning heavily, and shedding tears, and before his exe­ <lb/>
            cution bewailing their brother while he was still alive, and <lb/>
            bewailing also their father no less than him, because he had <lb/>
            foretold the calamities which would happen to his son, on <lb/>
            which account he was unwilling to permit their brother to <lb/>
            travel with them when they wished him to do so.</p>
          <p>And being downcast and confused they returned back by <lb/>
            the same road to the city, being quite overwhelmed at what <lb/>
            had happened, and looking at what had taken place as a <lb/>
            plot, and not suspecting their brother of covetousness.</p>
          <p>Then when they were brought before the governor of the <lb/>
            country they displayed their real affection and brotherly <lb/>
            love with genuine feeling, for falling all together at his knees <lb/>
            as if they were all liable to be punished for the theft, a <lb/>
            wickedness too great to be mentioned, they all wept over <lb/>
            him, and besought him, and gave themselves up to him, and <lb/>
            offered to submit to voluntary slavery, and called him their <lb/>
            master, speaking of themselves as foreign captives, as slaves, <lb/>
            as bought with a price, and omitting no name whatever <lb/>
            indicative of the most complete slavery ; but he, wishing to <lb/>
            try them still more, addressed them in a most angry manner, <lb/>
            and with the greatest possible severity, and said to them, <lb/>
            " May I never be guilty of such an action as to condemn <lb/>
            such a number to captivity for the sin of one, for how can <lb/>
            it be right to summon those persons to share in a punish­ <lb/>
            ment who have had no share in the commission of the <lb/>
             <pb n="499"/>
            offence ? Let him alone be punished, since he alone has <lb/>
            committed the crime. I know therefore that by your laws <lb/>
            you condemn the man who has been found guilty of theft to <lb/>
            be put to death in front of the city; but I, wishing to act in <lb/>
            all respects in a gentle and most merciful manner, will <lb/>
            mitigate the punishment, and adjudge him to slavery instead <lb/>
            of to death."</p>
          <p>XXXVIII. And when they were grieved at his threat, <lb/>
            and wholly overwhelmed at the false accusations brought <lb/>
            against them, the fourth in age, and he was one of a daring <lb/>
            character, combined with modesty, and full of true courage, <lb/>
            inasmuch as he had studied freedom of speech without <lb/>
            impudence, came forward and said, "I entreat you, 0 <lb/>
            master ! not to give way to your passion ; nor, because you <lb/>
            are placed in the rank next to the king, to be in a hurry to <lb/>
            condemn us before you have heard our defence. When on <lb/>
            our former journey hither, you inquired of us concerning <lb/>
            our brother and our father, we answered you: Our father <lb/>
            was an old man, aged, not more because of the power of <lb/>
            time, than because of his uninterrupted misfortunes, by <lb/>
            which he has been constantly exercised like a wrestler, and <lb/>
            has passed his whole life amid labours and calamities hard <lb/>
            to be borne.</p>
          <p>"And our brother is very young, a mere child, loved <lb/>
            beyond all measure by his father, since he is the son of his <lb/>
            old age, and because also he had but him and one other <lb/>
            child by the same mother, and this one alone is left, since <lb/>
            the elder died a violent death. And when you commanded <lb/>
            us to bring our brother hither, and threatened us that, if he <lb/>
            did not come, you would not permit us to come into your <lb/>
            sight, we departed in great depression of spirits; and with <lb/>
            difficulty, when we had arrived at home, did we declare the <lb/>
            commands which we had received from you to our father. <lb/>
            And he at first wholly refused, being greatly alarmed for <lb/>
            the child; but as necessary food was becoming scarce, and <lb/>
            as not one of us dared to come hither to buy food without <lb/>
            our youngest brother, by reason of your vehement commands; <lb/>
            he was at last, with difficulty, persuaded to send him with <lb/>
            us, blaming us bitterly for having confessed that we had <lb/>
            another brother, and pitying himself very much for being <lb/>
            about to be separated from him; for he is but a child and <note type="footnote"> K K 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="500"/>
            wholly ignorant of business, and not only of business in a <lb/>
            foreign land, but even of such as is transacted in his own city.</p>
          <p>" How, then, shall we approach our father who is under <lb/>
            the influence of such feelings ? And with what eyes shall <lb/>
            we be able to behold him without this his youngest son ? <lb/>
            He will die most miserably if he only hears that his son has <lb/>
            not returned ; and then all those who delight in hatred and <lb/>
            in evil-speaking, and who rejoice in such misfortunes of <lb/>
            their neighbours, will call us murderers and parricides, and <lb/>
            the greater part of the accusation will fall upon me ; for I <lb/>
            promised my father to give him up many things, confessing <lb/>
            that I received my brother as a pledge, which I was to <lb/>
            restore whenever he was re-claimed from me. And how <lb/>
            shall I be able to restore him unless you are prevailed upon <lb/>
            to show us mercy ? I entreat you, then, to have pity on the <lb/>
            old man, and to give a thought to the evils by which he will <lb/>
            be grieved, if he does not receive back again him whom he <lb/>
            has unwisely entrusted to my hands.</p>
          <p>" Nevertheless, do you exact punishment for the injuries <lb/>
            which you imagine to have been done to you; and that <lb/>
            punishment I will volunteer to submit to. Set me down as <lb/>
            your slave from this day forth. I will cheerfully undergo <lb/>
            the fate of those who have been just bought, if you will only <lb/>
            be willing to let the child go free ; and not only shall you, <lb/>
            if you will give him his liberty, receive thanks from him and <lb/>
            me, but also from him who is not present, but who will then <lb/>
            be relieved from his anxiety, the father of these men here, <lb/>
            and of all the family ; for we are all your suppliants, having <lb/>
            fled for succour to your right hand, and may we never fail <lb/>
            to obtain it.</p>
          <p>" Let, then, compassion for the age of the old man <lb/>
            seize your heart, who during his whole life has constantly <lb/>
            devoted himself to the labours of virtue. He has brought <lb/>
            all the cities of Syria to receive him, and to submit to his <lb/>
            authority, and to do him honour; even though he guides <lb/>
            himself by foreign customs and laws very different from <lb/>
            them, and although he is in all respects very unlike the <lb/>
            natives of the land. But the excellence of his life, and the <lb/>
            consistency and uniformity of his actions with his words, <lb/>
            and of his words with his actions, have prevailed, so that he <lb/>
            has been able to win over those who, out of regard for their <lb/>
            national customs, were not at first well-disposed towards <lb/>
             <pb n="501"/>
            him. You will do him such a favour that it will not be <lb/>
            possible for him to receive a greater. For what can be a <lb/>
            more valuable gift to give to a father, than to allow him to <lb/>
            receive back a son of whose safety he has despaired?"</p>
          <p>XXXIX. But all this conduct was but an experiment, <lb/>
            just as the former circumstances had been too, because the <lb/>
            governor of the country was desirous to see what kind of <lb/>
            good-will they had towards him who was his brother by the <lb/>
            same mother. For he had been afraid that they felt some <lb/>
            kind of natural dislike towards him, as children of a step­ <lb/>
            mother often do to the family of a previous wife of their father, <lb/>
            who may have been held in equal honours by him. It was <lb/>
            with this view that he both reproached them as spies and <lb/>
            inquired about their family, for the sake of knowing whether <lb/>
            his brother was still alive, or whether he had been put out <lb/>
            of the way by treachery. And he retained one while he <lb/>
            allowed the rest to depart, after they had agreed to bring <lb/>
            back their youngest brother with them, whom he desired to <lb/>
            see above all things, and so to be relieved of his bitter and <lb/>
            grievous sorrow on his account. And when he arrived, and <lb/>
            when he beheld his brother, he was then in a slight degree <lb/>
            relieved from his anxiety, and he invited them to an enter­ <lb/>
            tainment, and while he was feasting them he regaled his <lb/>
            own brother by the same mother with more costly viands <lb/>
            and luxuries than the rest, looking carefully at every one ot <lb/>
            them, and judging from their countenances whether there <lb/>
            was any envy secretly cherished in their hearts. And when <lb/>
            he saw them all cheerful, and all eager, and earnest for the <lb/>
            honour of the youngest, conjecturing now by two strong <lb/>
            proofs that there was no hatred smouldering beneath, he <lb/>
            devised a third mode of trial likewise, bringing a charge <lb/>
            against their youngest brother, that he appeared to have <lb/>
            committed a theft; for this was likely to be the clearest <lb/>
            possible proof of the disposition of each of them and of the <lb/>
            affection which they bore to their brother, who was thus <lb/>
            falsely accused.</p>
          <p>From all which circumstances he now clearly saw that his <lb/>
            mother's offspring was not looked upon with hostile feelings <lb/>
            and was not plotted against, and he also received a very <lb/>
            probable impression respecting the events which had befallen <lb/>
            himself, and learnt to think that he had suffered what he <lb/>
            had, not so much because of the treachery of his brethren, <lb/>
             <pb n="502"/>
            as through the direction of the providence of God who sees <lb/>
            things afar off, and who beholds the future no less than the <lb/>
            present.</p>
          <p>XL. After this he had recourse to a reconciliation and <lb/>
            agreement with his brethren, being influenced by his own <lb/>
            affectionate disposition, and from his desire to cause no <lb/>
            shame to his brethren, and to give no cause of reproach <lb/>
            against them because of their conduct towards him, he did <lb/>
            not choose that any of the Egyptians should be present on <lb/>
            the occasion of his first making himself known to them. <lb/>
            But he ordered all the servants to leave the apartment, and <lb/>
            suddenly pouring forth a stream of tears, and signing to <lb/>
            them with his right hand to approach nearer to him, that no <lb/>
            one else might be able by chance even to hear any thing that <lb/>
            passed, he said unto them, "I, being about to reveal a <lb/>
            matter which has long been kept in the shade, and which <lb/>
            has appeared to be hidden by the long lapse of time, do now <lb/>
            by myself disclose it to you by yourselves. I myself am that <lb/>
            brother whom yousold to go into Egypt, I'whom you now <lb/>
            behold standing here."</p>
          <p>And when they were all amazed at seeing him beyond all <lb/>
            their expectation, and were greatly agitated, and, as if under <lb/>
            the influence of some violent attraction, cast their eyes down <lb/>
            to the ground, and stood motionless, mute, and speechless, <lb/>
            he said, " Be not cast down; I give you complete forgive­ <lb/>
            ness for all the things which you have done to me. Do not <lb/>
            think that you want any one else as a mediator. I, of my <lb/>
            own absolute power and of my own voluntary inclination, <lb/>
            come of my own accord to an agreement with you; being <lb/>
            guided by two especial signs, first, by my piety towards <lb/>
            my father, to whom I owe a great deal of gratitude, and <lb/>
            also, secondly, by my own natural humanity, which I feel <lb/>
            towards all men, and especially towards those of my own <lb/>
            blood.</p>
          <p>" And I think that it was not you, but God, who was the <lb/>
            author of the events which happened to me, because he <lb/>
            desired that I should be the servant and minister of his <lb/>
            graces and gifts which he thought fit to bestow on the <lb/>
            human race in the time of their greatest necessity. And in <lb/>
            the very outset you may receive a proof of what I say in the <lb/>
            things which you see. I am the governor of all the land of <lb/>
            Egypt, and the honours which I enjoy are next to those of <lb/>
             <pb n="503"/>
            the king himself, and the aged monarch honours me, though <lb/>
            I am only a young man, as if I were his father; and I am <lb/>
            honoured and obeyed not only by the people of the country <lb/>
            but also by numerous other nations, whether they are sub­ <lb/>
            ject to Egypt or independent; for they all have need of me, <lb/>
            the governor of the land, by reason of their present scarcity. <lb/>
            For silver and gold, and what is still more necessary than either <lb/>
            of these'things, namely, food, is all stored up in my treasure- <lb/>
            houses alone, and it is I who distribute and dispense what <lb/>
            they want for their unavoidable necessities to each indivi­ <lb/>
            dual, so that nothing is wanting either for food or for the <lb/>
            satisfying of their natural wants.</p>
          <p>" And I have not detailed all this to you from a wish to <lb/>
            exalt myself or to give myself airs, but that you may know <lb/>
            that it is no one of you or any man whatsoever that has <lb/>
            been the cause of my being first a slave and afterwards a <lb/>
            prisoner. For on one occasion a false accusation was <lb/>
            brought against me, and I was thrown into prison. But he <lb/>
            who changed that extremity of calamity and misfortune into <lb/>
            the highest and most complete. good fortune was God, with <lb/>
            whom all things are possible.</p>
          <p>" Since these then, are my opinions, do not fear any <lb/>
            longer, but discard all your sorrow and anxiety, and change <lb/>
            to a joyful cheerfulness; and it will be well for you to <lb/>
            hasten to your father, and to be the first to take him the <lb/>
            good news of my being found, for reports are quick in <lb/>
            penetrating everywhere."</p>
          <p>XLI. So they one after another began to pour forth <lb/>
            praises of him without ceasing, and panegyrized him with <lb/>
            unmodified encomium, each relating some different circum <lb/>
            stance to his credit, one extolling his forgiving spirit, another <lb/>
            his affection towards his family, and another his accuteness; <lb/>
            and the whole company of them extolled his piety, and <lb/>
            attributed to God the happy end to which everything had <lb/>
            been brought, and being no longer melancholy or out of <lb/>
            humour at the unexpected events which befell them, on <lb/>
            their first arrival or at their original difficulties; they also <lb/>
            praised his excessive patience and fortitude, combined with <lb/>
            modesty, when he, who had experienced such vicissitudes of <lb/>
            fortune, neither when he was a.slave, allowed himself to say <lb/>
            a single word to the injury of his brothers, as having sold <lb/>
            him, nor, when he was led away to brison, did he in his <lb/>
             <pb n="504"/>
            despondency say a single word that he should not have said, <lb/>
            nor, though he remained there a long time, as prisoners <lb/>
            usually do, did he, as is so much the custom, compare his <lb/>
            misfortunes with those of his fellow prisoners so as to <lb/>
            reveal anything, but kept silence as if he had no knowledge <lb/>
            of the cause of the events that had happened to him.</p>
          <p>Nor again, when he was interpreting the dreams either to <lb/>
            the eunuch or to the king, which was a favourable occasion <lb/>
            for relating his own story, did he ever say a word about his <lb/>
            own nobility of birth, nor yet when he was appointed lieu­ <lb/>
            tenant of the king, and received the superintendence and <lb/>
            government of the whole of Egypt, even with the view of <lb/>
            not being thought an ignoble and obscure person, but one <lb/>
            who was really descended of noble ancestors, not a slave by <lb/>
            nature, but one who had been exposed to intolerable <lb/>
            treachery, and calamities at the hands of persons from <lb/>
            whom he was least entitled tv expect it.</p>
          <p>Moreover in addition to all this, great praise was be­ <lb/>
            stowed on his affability and courtesy; for being acquainted <lb/>
            with the insolence and rudeness of. other governors, they <lb/>
            marvelled at the absence of -pretence and display which <lb/>
            they saw in him, and they admired his kindness too, who, <lb/>
            though the moment that he beheld them after their first <lb/>
            journey he might have put them to death, or on the last <lb/>
            occasion cither, merely by refusing to supply them with <lb/>
            food when oppressed with hunger, was not content with not <lb/>
            punishing them, but even gave them necessary food gratui­ <lb/>
            tously as though they had been persons worthy of favour, <lb/>
            ordering the price they had paid to be restored to them: <lb/>
            and all the circumstances of their treachery towards him, <lb/>
            and of their selling him, were so wholly concealed from, and <lb/>
            unknown to any one, that the magistrates of the Egyptians <lb/>
            sympathised with him in his joy, as if this was the first <lb/>
            occasion of the brothers of the governor having arrived; <lb/>
            moreover they invited them to hospitality, and made haste <lb/>
            to relate their arrival to the king, and everything every­ <lb/>
            where was full of joy, no less than would have been the <lb/>
            case if the plain had suddenly become fertile, and the famine <lb/>
            had changed into abundance.</p>
          <p>XLII. But the king, when he heard that Joseph had a <lb/>
            father and a numerous family, advised him to press his <lb/>
            father to remove into Egypt with all his house, promising <lb/>
             <pb n="505"/>
            to give them the most fertile district in Egypt on their <lb/>
            arrival. Therefore Joseph gave his brothers chariots, and <lb/>
            waggons, and a great multitude of beasts of burden, loaded <lb/>
            with all necessary things, and a number of servants, that <lb/>
            they might conduct his father into Egypt in safety.</p>
          <p>But when they arrived at home, and told their father <lb/>
            their story about their brother, which was so apparently <lb/>
            incredible and beyond all his hopes, he did not much <lb/>
            believe them; for even though those who brought the <lb/>
            account were trustworthy, still the greatness and extraor­ <lb/>
            dinary character of the circumstances which they reported, <lb/>
            did not allow him to believe them easily: but when the old <lb/>
            man saw the vast preparation, and the supplies of all neces­ <lb/>
            sary things, at such a time, in such abundance, correspond­ <lb/>
            ing to the good fortune of his son which they were reporting <lb/>
            to him, he praised God that he had made complete that <lb/>
            part of his house which seemed to be deficient; but his joy <lb/>
            immediately begat fear again in his soul, respecting his <lb/>
            departure from his national laws and customs ; for he knew <lb/>
            that youth is by nature prone to fall, and that in foreign <lb/>
            nations there is great indulgence given to error; and <lb/>
            especially in the country of gypt, a land in a state of utter <lb/>
            blindness respecting the true God, in consequence of their <lb/>
            making created and mortal things into gods.</p>
          <p>Moreover, the addition of riches and glory is a snare to <lb/>
            'weak minds, and he also recollected that he had been left to <lb/>
            himself, as no one had gone forth out of his father's house <lb/>
            with him to keep him in the right way, but he had been <lb/>
            left solitary and destitute of all good instructions, and <lb/>
            might therefore be supposed to be ready to change and adopt <lb/>
            their foreign customs. Therefore, when that Being who <lb/>
            alone is able to behold the invisible soul, saw him in this <lb/>
            frame of mind, he took pity on him and appearing unto him <lb/>
            by night while he was lying asleep, said unto him: " Fear <lb/>
            nothing about your departure into Egypt; I myself will <lb/>
            guide you on your way, and will give you a safe and <lb/>
            pleasant journey; and I will restore to you your long <lb/>
            lamented son, who was once many years ago believed by <lb/>
            you to have died, but who is not only alive, but is even <lb/>
            governor of all that mighty country."</p>
          <p>So Jacob, being filled with good hopes, rose up in the <lb/>
            morning with joy, and hastened on his way; and when his <lb/>
             <pb n="506"/>
            son heard that he was near, for scouts and watchers who <lb/>
            were placed along the road gave him notice of everything, <lb/>
            he went with speed to meet his father when he was at no <lb/>
            great distance from the borders of the land; and they met <lb/>
            one another near the city, which is called the city of heroes, <lb/>
            and they fell into one another's arms placing their heads on <lb/>
            each other's necks, and soaking their garments with tears, <lb/>
            and satisfying themselves abundantly with long enduring <lb/>
            embraces, and unwillingly at last loosing one another, they <lb/>
            proceeded to the palace. And when the king beheld them he <lb/>
            was amazed at the dignity of Jacob's appearance, and he <lb/>
            received and saluted him not as the father of his lieutenant <lb/>
            but as his own, with all possible respect and honour; and <lb/>
            after showing him not only all the ordinary but also many <lb/>
            extraordinary marks of respect, he gave him a most excellent <lb/>
            district of land of the greatest fertility ; and hearing that <lb/>
            his sons were skilful breeders of cattle, having great sub­ <lb/>
            stance in flocks and herds, he appointed them overseers of <lb/>
            all his own flocks and herds, and committed to their charge <lb/>
            his goats, and his oxen, and his sheep, and all his innume­ <lb/>
            rable animals of every kind.</p>
          <p>XLIII. And the young man, Joseph, displayed such ex­ <lb/>
            cessive good faith and honesty in all his dealings, that <lb/>
            though the time and the circumstances of the time gave <lb/>
            him innumerable opportunities of making money, so that <lb/>
            he might, in a short period, have become the richest man of <lb/>
            that age or kingdom, he still so truly honoured genuine <lb/>
            riches before illegitimate wealth, and the treasure which <lb/>
            sees rather than that which is blind, that he stored up all <lb/>
            the silver and gold which he collected as the price of the <lb/>
            corn in the king's treasury, not appropriating a single <lb/>
            drachm of it to his own use, but being satisfied with nothing <lb/>
            beyond the gifts which the king bestowed on him volun­ <lb/>
            tarily, in acknowledgment of his services.</p>
          <p>And in this manner he governed Egypt, and other countries <lb/>
            also with it, and other nations, while oppressed with the <lb/>
            famine, in a manner too admirable for any description to do <lb/>
            it justice, distributing food to all in a proper manner, and <lb/>
            looking, not only at the present advantage, but also at what <lb/>
            would be of future benefit: therefore, when the seventh <lb/>
            year of the scarcity arrived, he sent for the farmers (for <lb/>
            there was now a prospect of fertility and abundance), and <lb/>
             <pb n="507"/>
            gave them barley and wheat for seed, taking care that no <lb/>
            one should appropriate what he gave for other purposes, but <lb/>
            should sow what he received in the fields, to which end he <lb/>
            selected men of honesty and virtues as overseers and super­ <lb/>
            intendents, who were to take care that the sowing was <lb/>
            properly performed.</p>
          <p>And when a long time after the famine his father died, <lb/>
            his brothers were filled with secret misgivings, and feared <lb/>
            lest now he should remember the evil that they had done to <lb/>
            him, and should retaliate upon them and afflict them, and so <lb/>
            they came to him and besought him earnestly, bringing <lb/>
            with them their wives and their children. And he wept <lb/>
            and said, " The occasion indeed is a natural one, to fill with <lb/>
            secret apprehension those who have done intolerable things, <lb/>
            and who are convicted more by their own consciences than <lb/>
            by anything else; for the death of our father has revived in <lb/>
            you the ancient fear which you entertained before our re­ <lb/>
            conciliation, that I had merely bestowed pardon on you for <lb/>
            the sake of not grieving our father; but I do not change <lb/>
            my disposition with the changes of time, nor, after I have <lb/>
            agreed to a reconciliation and forgiveness, will I ever do <lb/>
            anything inconsistent with such agreement; for I have not <lb/>
            been postponing revenge and watching for opportunities to <lb/>
            wreak it, but I once for all gave you immunity from all <lb/>
            punishment, being influenced partly by feelings of respect <lb/>
            for my father, for I must speak the plain truth, and partly <lb/>
            by natural necessary affection for you.</p>
          <p>" But if I did every thing that was merciful and humane <lb/>
            for my father's sake while he was alive, I will also adhere to <lb/>
            it now that he is dead. But in my real opinion no good <lb/>
            man ever dies, but such will live for ever and ever, without <lb/>
            growing old, in an immortal nature which is no longer bound <lb/>
            up in the necessities of the body. And why should I <lb/>
            remember only that father who was created and born ? We <lb/>
            have also the uncreated, immortal, everlasting God for our <lb/>
            father, who sees all things and hears all people, even when <lb/>
            silent, and who always sees even those things which lie <lb/>
            hidden in the recesses of the mind, and whom I look upon <lb/>
            and invoke as a witness of my sincere reconciliation; for <lb/>
            ' I am (and do not you be astonished at my words), I am in <lb/>
            the place of God,'* who has changed your evil designs <note type="footnote"> Genesis 1. 19. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="508"/>
            against me so as to bring forth from them an abundance of <lb/>
            good things. Be ye therefore fearless, and know that for <lb/>
            the future you shall enjoy still better fortune than hitherto <lb/>
            you have while our father was still alive."</p>
          <p>XLIV. Having encouraged his brethren with these words <lb/>
            he confirmed his promises still more by actions, leaving out <lb/>
            nothing which could show his care for his brethren.</p>
          <p>And after the famine, when the inhabitants were now full <lb/>
            of joy at the fertility and prosperity of the country he was <lb/>
            honoured by all men, who thus recompensed him for the <lb/>
            benefits which they had received from him in the season of <lb/>
            their despair. And the report of him became noised abroad, <lb/>
            and filled all the cities with his glory and reputation.</p>
          <p>And he lived a hundred and ten years, and then died at a <lb/>
            good old age, having enjoyed the greatest perfection of <lb/>
            beauty, and wisdom, and eloquence of speech. The beauty <lb/>
            of his person is testified to by- the violent love with which he <lb/>
            inflamed the wife of the eunuch; his wisdom by the even­ <lb/>
            ness of his conduct in the indescribable variety of circum­ <lb/>
            stances that attended the whole of his life, by which he <lb/>
            wrought regularity among things that were irregular, and <lb/>
            harmony among things that were discordant. His eloquence <lb/>
            of speech is displayed in his interpretation of the dreams, in <lb/>
            his affability in ordinary conversation, and by the persuasion <lb/>
            which followed his words; in consequence of which his <lb/>
            subjects all obeyed him cheerfully and voluntarily, rather <lb/>
            than from any compulsion.</p>
          <p>Of these hundred and ten years he spent seventeen, till <lb/>
            the expiration of his boyhood, in his father's house; and <lb/>
            thirteen he passed amid unforeseen events, being plotted <lb/>
            against, and sold, and becoming a slave, and having false <lb/>
            accusations brought against him, and being thrown into <lb/>
            prison; and the remaining eighty years he spent in autho­ <lb/>
            rity and in all manner of prosperity, being the most excellent <lb/>
            manager and administrator both of scarcity and plenty, and <lb/>
            the most competent of all men to manage affairs under <lb/>
            either complexion of circumstances.</p>
