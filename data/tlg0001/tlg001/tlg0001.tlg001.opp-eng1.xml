            <title type="main">SHORT LIFE OF APOLLONIUS RHODIUS, WITH A FEW REMARKS ON HIS " ARGONAUTICA."</title>
          </head>
          <p>A <lb/>
            POLLONIUS RHODIUS was born about B.C. 235, in <lb/>
            the reign of Ptolemy Euergetes, either at Alexandria <lb/>
            or at Naucratis. Strabo is in favour of the former, while <lb/>
            Athenæus and Ælian declare for the latter place.</p>
          <p>He appears to have given himself up at an early age to <lb/>
            literary pursuits, and his choice is scarcely to be wondered <lb/>
            at when we reflect upon the age in which he lived and <lb/>
            the literary atmosphere in which he found himself. We <lb/>
            are not expressly told whether it was choice or necessity <lb/>
            that led him to select the career he did, but from the fact <lb/>
            that the leading poet of that day took the young aspirant <lb/>
            in hand and instructed him in his art, we may fairly infer <lb/>
            that Apollonius was a man of some standing and position <lb/>
            in life. His studies, however, under his master Callimachus <lb/>
            were not destined to do either pupil or teacher. much <lb/>
            credit; no doubt he obtained some technical skill in his <lb/>
            art, but the tastes of Callimachus and Apollonius were so <lb/>
            diametrically opposed that the two poets quarrelled, and <lb/>
            allowed their professional jealousy to go to such lengths <lb/>
            that Apollonius lampooned the style of his teacher, while <lb/>
            Callimachus was weak enough to retaliate in a studied <lb/>
             <pb n="X"/>
            retort under the title of " Ibis," the character of which <lb/>
            poem, though lost to us, may be gathered from Ovid's <lb/>
            poem of the same name.</p>
          <p>Callimachus was the leading exponent of the strained <lb/>
            and artificial poetry of his day. Apollonius, with more <lb/>
            true artistic instinct, revolted from the want of reality <lb/>
            characteristic of most of his contemporaries, and having a <lb/>
            genuine admiration for the straightforward simplicity of <lb/>
            the Epic age, set himself to imitate Homer. Naturally he <lb/>
            made many enemies among the host of poetasters who <lb/>
            took their cue from the animosity shown to him by the <lb/>
            " Laureate " of the Alexandrine court. Hence, when the <lb/>
            “ Argonautica" appeared, it was at once condemned as <lb/>
            violating the accepted canons of style and composition, <lb/>
            and partly, perhaps, owing to certain youthful crudities <lb/>
            which were afterwards corrected. Great was the chagrin <lb/>
            of the young poet at the reception of his work, and fierce <lb/>
            was his anger against Callimachus. The position of the <lb/>
            latter, however, was unassailable, and so Apollonius, after <lb/>
            a fruitless wordy warfare, determined to seek some new <lb/>
            opening for his genius. Accordingly he bade farewell to <lb/>
            ungrateful Alexandria, and retired to Rhodes, then the <lb/>
            second great seat of literature, taking his poem with <lb/>
            him.</p>
          <p>Possibly experience had taught him wherein his poem was <lb/>
            deficient. At any rate, he revised the whole of it; and <lb/>
            now, free from the cabals of jealous rivals, he received a <lb/>
            fair verdict, and at once rose to fame. So popular, indeed, <lb/>
            did he become on the reading of his poem, that the <lb/>
            Rhodians, it is said, rewarded him with extraordinary <lb/>
            honours, and conferred their franchise upon him. From <lb/>
             <pb n="XI"/>
            this incident in his career he came to be called “the <lb/>
            Rhodian," a name which has clung to him for ever.</p>
          <p>It was only natural that in his hour of triumph he <lb/>
            should long to have his merit acknowledged in his native <lb/>
            city-in Alexandria, the gathering place of the old world's <lb/>
            declining literature and art. Thither, therefore, he came, <lb/>
            with his honours upon him, and whether it was that <lb/>
            Callimachus and his followers were out of favour, or <lb/>
            whether the Alexandrines had relented towards their ill­ <lb/>
            used poet, certain it is that he attained to great celebrity, <lb/>
            and was advanced to valuable posts of trust. Henceforth <lb/>
            he could afford to rest upon his hardly-won laurels, his <lb/>
            period of " Sturm und Drang " was over ; he had passed <lb/>
            through the fire, and it had done him no hurt—weighed <lb/>
            in the balance he had not been found wanting.</p>
          <p>Of his life henceforth we learn but little, beyond what <lb/>
            Suidas tells us as to his having become librarian in the <lb/>
            vast royal museum at Alexandria, about B.C. 194. It may <lb/>
            well be that this was so; for the Ptolemies, in whose <lb/>
            reigns Apollonius lived and wrote, were monarchs not <lb/>
            unlikely to bestow such an important literary post upon <lb/>
            a man of marked ability and studious habits. Assuming <lb/>
            that Suidas is correct in his statement, we find plenty of <lb/>
            internal evidence in the poem to suggest that the writer <lb/>
            must have been a man of vast erudition, or have had at <lb/>
            his command extensive stores of knowledge from which <lb/>
            to draw his materials.</p>
          <p>During this period of his life the poet was not idle. <lb/>
            Imbued to some extent with the spirit of his age, he <lb/>
            produced works at a great pace; epigrams, grammars, <lb/>
            and the so-called <foreign xml:lang="grc">κτίσεις</foreign>, i.e. poems on the origin and <lb/>
             <pb n="XII"/>
            foundation of towns, but all these are lost to us save a <lb/>
            few mutilated fragments and stray lines preserved in <lb/>
            other writers.</p>
          <p>In the library at Alexandria he remained until his <lb/>
            death in B.C. 181, happy enough, no doubt, amongst the <lb/>
            endless treasures of that vast repository of art and <lb/>
            learning.</p>
          <p>Of his work that has come down to us, too little notice <lb/>
            has been taken by English scholars ; for though his style <lb/>
            at times bears too evident traces of laboured study, the <lb/>
            structure of his poem is simple and straightforward. The <lb/>
            mind is not burdened by a multiplicity of episodes, the <lb/>
            descriptions are singularly beautiful, and the similes, <lb/>
            which are abundant and varied, show the hand of a master, <lb/>
            who, if he did sometimes imitate, had at least something <lb/>
            graceful of his own to add to what he borrowed, and not <lb/>
            infrequently paid back his loan with interest.</p>
          <p>The work found numerous commentators in ancient <lb/>
            times, to whom we are indebted for the Florentine and <lb/>
            Parisian Scholia. Moreover, Apollonius was very popular <lb/>
            among the Romans; so much so that his poem was trans­ <lb/>
            lated by Publius Terentius Varro Atacinus, and was <lb/>
            imitated by Valerius Flaccus and many others. <lb/>

          </head>
          <p>T <lb/>
            YRO, the daughter of Salmoneus, had two sons by <lb/>
            Poseidon, Neleus and Pelias ; she afterwards wedded <lb/>
            Cretheus, son of Æolus, and bore to him Æson, Pheres, and <lb/>
            Amythaon. From Æson sprang Jason; from Pheres, <lb/>
            Admetus ; from Amythaon, Melampus.</p>
          <p>Now Jason was handed over to the Centaur Chiron to be <lb/>
            brought up and to learn the art of healing; while Æson, his <lb/>
            father, left the kingdom to Pelias, his own brother, bidding <lb/>
            him rule Thessaly until Jason's return from Chiron. But <lb/>
            Pelias had received an oracle from Apollo, bidding him <lb/>
            beware of a man who should come with only one sandal; <lb/>
            for by him should he be slain.</p>
          <p>So Jason grew up, and came to his uncle, for to take his <lb/>
            share in his father's kingdom. But when he came to the <lb/>
            river Anaurus, which is in Thessaly, wishing to ford it, <lb/>
            there upon the bank he found Hera in the disguise of an <lb/>
            old dame, and she would cross, but was afraid. Then did <lb/>
            Jason take her upon his shoulders, and carry her safe over, <lb/>
            but one sandal left he in the mud in the middle of the <lb/>
            river. Thence he fared to the city with his one sandal, and <lb/>
            there he found an assembly of the folk, and Pelias doing <lb/>
            sacrifice to the gods. When Pelias saw him thus he <lb/>
            minded him of the oracle, and being eager to be rid of him <lb/>
            he set him this task, that he should go to Scythia in quest. <lb/>
             <pb n="XVI"/>
            of the golden fleece, and then receive the kingdom. Now <lb/>
            this he did from no wish for the fleece, but because he <lb/>
            thought that Jason would be slain by some man in that <lb/>
            strange land, or be shipwrecked.</p>
          <p>This is the story of the golden fleece.</p>

          <p>A <lb/>
            THAMAS, the son of Æolus, and brother of Cre­ <lb/>
            theus, had to wife Nephele first, and begat two <lb/>
            children, Phrixus and Helle. When Nephele died, he <lb/>
            married Ino, who did plot against the children of Nephele, <lb/>
            and persuaded her country-women to roast the seed for <lb/>
            sowing; but the earth, receiving roasted seed, would not <lb/>
            bear her yearly crops. So Athamas sent to Delphi to in­ <lb/>
            quire about the barrenness; but Ino bribed his messengers, <lb/>
            telling them to return and say, that the god had answered <lb/>
            that Helle and Phrixus must be sacrificed if they wanted <lb/>
            the barrenness to cease. Wherefore Athamas was per­ <lb/>
            suaded, and placed them at the altar; but the gods in pity <lb/>
            snatched them away through the air by means of the ram <lb/>
            with the golden fleece; now Helle let go, and fell into the <lb/>
            sea that bears her name, while Phrixus landed safe in <lb/>
            Colchis. There he offered up the ram to Zeus, who helped <lb/>
            his flight, for that he bad escaped the plot of his step­ <lb/>
            mother. And having married Chalciope, daughter of <lb/>
            Æetes, king of the Scythians, he begat four sons, Argus, <lb/>
            Cytissorus, Melas, and Phrontis. And there he died. <note type="footnote"> b </note></p><pb n="XVIII"/>

            accurate. It is when we attempt to follow his account of the <lb/>
            return journey, which was made by a different route, that we <lb/>
            find ourselves utterly perplexed, and forced to the conclusion <lb/>
            that our author has been drawing purely from imagination, <lb/>
            without any idea of the impossibility of the course which he <lb/>
            assigns to the heroes.</p>
          <p>However, we purpose to give the route as described by the <lb/>
            poet, noticing difficulties as they occur, though we shall not <lb/>
            attempt to correct geographical errors in an account which by <lb/>
            no conceivable theory can be reconciled with actual fact.</p>
          <p>The expedition starts from Iolchos in Thessaly (i. 523). The <lb/>
            ship Argo is moored in the river Anaurus (i. 320). Leaving the <lb/>
            harbour of Pagasæ (i. 523), the Argonauts sail through the <lb/>
            Sinus Pelasgicus, past the promontory of Tisa (i. 568) and the <lb/>
            headland of Sepias (i. 582); then coasting between the island of <lb/>
            Sciathus (i. 583) and along the Thessalian coast, past the tomb <lb/>
            of Dolops (i. 584), Melibœa (i. 592), the mouth of the river <lb/>
            Amyrus (i. 596), Eurymenæ (i. 597), and the spurs of Ossa and <lb/>
            Olympus (i. 598), they make right across the mouth of the Ther­ <lb/>
            maic gulf to the promontory of Pallene (i. 599) ; thence, after <lb/>
            sighting Mount Athos (i. 601), they steer for Lemnos (i. 608). <lb/>
            After some stay in this island, they go out of their course to the <lb/>
            isle of Electra or Samothrace, for the sake of certain mysteries <lb/>
            (i. 916); then keeping Thrace on the left of the ship and Imbros <lb/>
            on the right, they sail across the Ægean Sea (i. 923) to the <lb/>
             <pb n="XXI"/>
            mouth of the Hellespont (i. 928). Through the Hellespont they <lb/>
            sail past Rhœteum, Ilium, Abydos, Percote, Abarnis, and so to <lb/>
            Cyzicus, then an island, now mainland (i. 929 sqq.) in the Pro­ <lb/>
            pontis. Next they pass the mouth of the river Æsepus (i. 940) <lb/>
            and come to the harbour and bay of Chytus (i. 987), but at this <lb/>
            point they are caught by contrary winds and driven back again <lb/>
            to Cyzicus (i. 1110). Halting here awhile they go inland to <lb/>
            ascend Mount Dindymus and spy out their further route ; then <lb/>
            go on again across the mouth of the river Rhyndacus in Mysia <lb/>
            (i. 1165) until they reach the headland of Posideum (i. 1279), <lb/>
            near to which live the savage Bebryces, whom they encounter <lb/>
            and defeat (ii. 1 sqq.) at the mouth of the Bosporus. Thence, <lb/>
            after meeting the blind prophet Phineus in Bithynia (ii. 177), <lb/>
            they pass through the dreadful Symplegades or Cyanean Rocks, <lb/>
            which guard the entrance to the Euxine Sea (ii. 560 sqq.); <lb/>
            coasting along Bithynia (ii. 621) they pass the mouth of the <lb/>
            river Rhebas (ii. 652), the rock of Colone, the Black Headland <lb/>
            (ii. 653), the river Phyllis (ii. 654), the river Calpe (ii. 661), and <lb/>
            anchor at the Thynian island (ii. 675). Next they cross the <lb/>
            mouth of the river Sangarius (ii. 724), passing the territory of <lb/>
            the Mariandyni (ii. 725), the river Lycus, lake Anthemous, the <lb/>
            river Acheron and its haven (ii. 726 sqq.); thence past river <lb/>
            Callichorus (ii. 906), the river Parthenius (ii. 938), Sesamus (ii. <lb/>
            943), Erythini, and the heights of Crobialus, Cromna, Cytorus <lb/>
            and Carambis in Paphlagonia (ii. 945); after this they pass <lb/>
            Sinope (ii. 948), the river Halys (ii. 965), the river Thermodon <lb/>
            (ii. 972), the Amazons and Chalybes (ii. 987 sqq.), the Tibareni, <lb/>
            Mossynœci (ii. 1012 sqq.), land at the isle of Ares and rescue the <lb/>
            sons of Chalciope (ii. 1033); thence to the isle of Philyra (ii. <lb/>
            1234), past the territory of the Macrones, Becheiri, Sapeiræ, <lb/>
            Byzeres, till they sight the range of Caucasus and the limit of <lb/>
            their voyage (ii. 1245 sqq.); they now enter the river Phasis, <lb/>
            the river of Colchis, wherein lies the isle of Æa (ii. 1264).</p>
          <p>The Argonauts have thus reached Æa. Their voyage as <lb/>
            sketched by Apollonius is singularly accurate, and it is clear that <lb/>
            he must have been familiar with the geography to have given <lb/>
            such an exhaustive list of places, hills, and rivers.</p>
          <p>Briefly the voyage amounts to this. The Argonauts leave the <lb/>
            Pelasgicus Sinus (Gulf of Volo), coast along Thessaly to Ther­ <lb/>
            maicus Sinus (Gulf of Salonica), steer across Ægæum Mare <lb/>
            (Archipelago) to the Hellespont (Dardanelles); through this <lb/>
            strait into the Propontis (Sea of Marmara); through the Bos­ <lb/>
            porus into the Euxine (Black Sea).</p>
          <p>Except when they cross the Archipelago, their voyage is <lb/>
            almost entirely a coasting one, and is easy to follow on a map.</p><pb n="XXII"/>
            
          <p>The return route retraces their steps as far as the river Halys <lb/>
            in Paphlagonia(iv. 245), but then, instead of rounding theheadland <lb/>
            of Carambis and following the coast-line (iv. 300), they strike <lb/>
            out a new course across the open sea to the mouth of the Ister <lb/>
            (Danube) (iv. 302). From this point very little information is <lb/>
            afforded us by Apollonius as to the places through which the <lb/>
            heroes passed. Certain names indeed are mentioned, but they <lb/>
            are difficult to identify or localize, e.g., Mount Anchurus (iv. <lb/>
            323), the rock of Cauliacus (iv. 324), the plain of Laurium (iv. <lb/>
            326), the Brygian isles (iv. 330). Apollonius was evidently <lb/>
            aware of the weakness of his own geography, and avoids all <lb/>
            details concerning this remarkable river-voyage ; he eventually <lb/>
            brings the heroes out into the Adriatic near the peninsula of <lb/>
            Hyllis (iv. 524). It is scarcely necessary to remark on the <lb/>
            impossibility of this route, owing to rocks, rapids, cataracts, <lb/>
            and an impassable current; nor are we told into what river the <lb/>
            Argonauts made their way out of the Ister in order to arrive at <lb/>
            the Adriatic at all. After this they steer towards the Italian <lb/>
            coast, passing the islands of Issa, Dusceladus, Pityeia, Corcyra <lb/>
            the Black (iv. 563), Melite, Cerossus, Nymphæa, and the <lb/>
            Ceraunian hills (iv. 570 sqq.) ; they come to the Eridanus (Po) <lb/>
            (iv. 594), and apparently sailing right across northern Italy, gain <lb/>
            by some unaccountable means the river Rhone (iv. 625). Here <lb/>
            again we are not informed how they achieved this remarkable <lb/>
            feat; the poet seems to labour under the delusion that the <lb/>
            Eridanus and Rhone are connected, and that a continuous <lb/>
            voyage is possible. Next the heroes are somewhat vaguely said <lb/>
            to pass through the territory of the Celts and Ligyans (iv. 645), <lb/>
            but no further point on their course is mentioned until they <lb/>
            arrive at the Stcechades Insulæ (Is. d'Hières, off the southern <lb/>
            coast of Provence) (iv. 652); thence they sail across the open <lb/>
            sea (Mediterranean) to the isle of Æthalia, passing above <lb/>
            Corsica (iv. 652), and so by a long coasting voyage along Italy <lb/>
            they reach the Ææan harbour and the promontory of Circe (iv. <lb/>
            659); thence passing the island of the Sirens (iv. 890) they come <lb/>
            to the Æolian isles, run the gauntlet of Scylla and Charybdis in <lb/>
            the straits between Italy and Sicily (iv. 920 sqq.), coast round the <lb/>
            bottom of Italy, and land at Drepane, i.e. Corcyra, where the <lb/>
            Phæacians live (iv. 980 sqq.); from Drepane they coast along <lb/>
            Epirus, Ambracia, and Acarnania, till they reach the Echinades <lb/>
            Insulæ (iv. 1228); but here they are caught by a violent tem­ <lb/>
            pest and driven to the Syrtis Minor of Africa (iv. 1233). Being <lb/>
            unable to get out of the quicksands they carry Argo overland <lb/>
            to lake Tritonis (iv. 1389), and, launching her again, sail out to <lb/>
            sea. Apparently they now made a very circuitous voyage along <lb/>
            the coasts of Africa and Asia Minor until they were opposite to <lb/>
             <pb n="XXIII"/>
            the island of Carpathus, which they are said to pass ; from <lb/>
            thence they came to Crete (iv. 1635); thence through the <lb/>
            Sporades into the Ægean to Ægina (iv. 1764); then along the <lb/>
            coast of Attica and between Eubœa and the Opuntian Locri (iv. <lb/>
            1779), through the Sinus Pelasgicus, to Pagasæ, whence they <lb/>
            had started.</p>
          <p>The return voyage teems with such insurmountable difficul­ <lb/>
            ties, and is altogether so hopelessly confused and mythical, that <lb/>
            it would be a mere waste of time and patience to attempt to <lb/>
            follow it on a modern map.</p>
          <p>We can only indicate briefly the course the heroes are said to <lb/>
            have taken. After crossing the Euxine (Black Sea), they rowed <lb/>
            through river-ways right across Dacia, Mœsia, Illyria, and <lb/>
            Dalmatia (Bulgaria, Servia, Bosnia, and Herzegovina), into the <lb/>
            Adriatic; sailing to Italy they cross the northern part by the <lb/>
            Eridanus (Po); sail into the Rhone, thence into the Mediter­ <lb/>
            ranean ; right across to the west coast of Italy, along which they <lb/>
            pass ; through the Lipari islands and the strait of Messina ; up <lb/>
            the east coast of Italy to the Adriatic again ; thence driven by <lb/>
            storms they come to the African coast; being caught in the <lb/>
            shoals of the Syrtis they carry Argo overland to lake Tritonis <lb/>
            (Bahr Faraouni in Tunis), and finding an outlet into the Medi­ <lb/>
            terranean, sail along the African coast to the coast of Asia <lb/>
            Minor, and so into the Ægean homewards.</p>

          <p>Now minstrels even before any day do tell how Argus by <lb/>
            the counsels of Athene built a ship for him ; but mine <lb/>
            shall it now be to declare the lineage and name of the <lb/>
            heroes, and their passage of the long sea, and all that they <lb/>
            did in their wanderings; and may the Muses be the <lb/>
            heralds of my song!</p>
          <p>First then let us make mention of Orpheus ; he it was, <lb/>
            whom, on a day, as rumour saith, Calliope bare beside the <lb/>
            peak of Pimpleia, her pledge of love to Thracian (Eager. <lb/>
            He, men say, did charm the stubborn rocks upon the hills <lb/>
            and the river streams by the strains of his minstrelsy. <lb/>
            And wild oaks, memorials yet of that his singing, which <lb/>
            he had led right on from Pieria by the spell, of his lyre, <lb/>
            marched in ordered ranks, each behind his fellow, to range <lb/>
            themselves, with all their leaves, upon the fringe of the <lb/>
            Thracian shore. So mighty a man was Orpheus, whom <lb/>
            the son of Æson, by the counsels of Chiron, did persuade <lb/>
            and take to help him in his toils from his kingship over <lb/>
            Bistonian Pieria.</p>
          <p>Anon came Asterion ; he it was whom Cometes did beget <lb/>
            by the waters of swirling Apidanus, when he dwelt in <lb/>
            Peiresia, hard by the Phylleian hill, where mighty Apidanus' <lb/>
            and divine Enipeus do unite, flowing into one stream from <lb/>
            their distant sources.</p>
          <p>To these came Polyphemus,2 son of Elatus, having left <lb/>

            the Centaurs, joined the fray as the youngest of the mighty <lb/>
            Lapithæ. Now on that day were his limbs weighed down <lb/>
            with wine, but firm abode his warlike spirit still, even as <lb/>
            aforetime.</p>
          <p>No long space was Iphiclus, uncle of the son of Æson, <lb/>
            left behind in Phylace; for Æson had wedded his sister, <lb/>
            Alcimede of Phylace; whence the claims of blood and kith <lb/>
            bade him enrol himself in the muster.</p>
          <p>Neither did Admetus, lord of Pheræ, rich in sheep, abide <lb/>
            beneath the peak of the Chalcodonian mountain.</p>
          <p>Erytus and Echion too, sons of Hermes, well skilled in <lb/>
            craftiness, and rich in broad cornlands, lingered not in <lb/>
            Alope; and yet a third arrived to join them as they were <lb/>
            starting, Æthalides, their kinsman; 1 him by the stream of <lb/>
            Myrmidonian Amphrysus did Eupolemeia, maid of Plithia, <lb/>
            bear; but those other twain were sons of Antianeira, <lb/>
            daughter of Menetes.</p>
          <p>Came too Coronus, son of Cæneus,2 leaving rich Gyrton, a <lb/>
            goodly man, yet scarce his father's match. For minstrels <lb/>
            tell how Cæneus, though he liveth yet, was slain by the <lb/>
            Centaurs; what time, alone and apart from the other <lb/>
            chiefs, he routed them; and, when they suddenly rallied <lb/>
            again, they could not make him give way nor slay him; <lb/>
            but he, unconquered and unflinching, passed beneath the <lb/>
            earth, smitten by the heavy pines they hurled on him.</p>
          <p>Next came Mopsus, sprung from Titaron; him the son <lb/>
            of Leto had taught the augury of birds beyond all men; <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">γνωτὸς</foreign> here as elsewhere in Apollonius Rhodius means " kinsman," <lb/>
            not "well-known." </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Cæneus took part in the battle between the Lapithæ and Centaurs. <lb/>
            Ovid, Metam. xii. 171 sqq., relates how Cæneus had originally been a <lb/>
            beautiful maiden named Cænis ; this maiden Poseidon loved and changed <lb/>
            into a man who should be invulnerable; so when in the battle the Cen­ <lb/>
            taurs could not kill Cæneus with sword or spear, they buried him alive <lb/>
            beneath a mass of trees, but even so his spirit sped away in the form of <lb/>
            a bird. </note> <pb n="6"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BOOK I."/><lb/>
            likewise came Eurydamas, son of Ctimenus, who had his <lb/>
            dwelling in Dolopian Ctimene, nigh unto the Xunian' <lb/>
            lake.</p>
          <p>Moreover Actor sent forth his son Menœtius from Opus, <lb/>
            to go with the chieftains.</p>
          <p>And Eurytion followed, and valiant Eribotes ; one the <lb/>
            son of Teleon, the other of Irus, son of Actor; verily, <lb/>
            famous Eribotes was sprung from Teleon, and Eurytion <lb/>
            had Irus for his sire. With these went a third, Oileus, <lb/>
            matchless for chivalry, and skilled enow in rushing on the <lb/>
            rear of the foe, what time their ranks give way.</p>
          <p>From Eubœa Canthus hied him forth ; he it was whom <lb/>
            Canethus, son of Abas, was sending with eager feet; yet <lb/>
            was he never to turn again and reach Cerinthus. For his <lb/>
            fate it was with Mopsus, that skilled diviner, to wander to <lb/>
            his death in the utmost ends of Libya. For of evils none <lb/>
            is too far away for man to meet therewith; seeing that <lb/>
            men buried those twain even in Libya, as far from Colchis <lb/>
            as the rising and the setting of the sun are seen to be from <lb/>
            each other.</p>
          <p>Next then gathered to the muster Clytius and Iphitus, <lb/>
            wardens of (Echalia, sons of Eurytus the harsh-that <lb/>
            Eurytus, to whom the far-darting god gave a bow ; yet had <lb/>
            he no joy of the gift, for of his own choice he strove with <lb/>
            the giver himself.</p>
          <p>After these the sons of Æacus joined the quest; they <lb/>
            came not both together, nor from the same place; for they <lb/>
            dwelt apart, keeping aloof from Ægina, since the day, <lb/>
            when in their witlessness they slew their kinsman Phocus. <lb/>
            Now Telamon had settled in Salamis, isle of Attica; while <lb/>
            Peleus went away and builded him a home in Phthia.</p>
          <p>Next came the warrior Butes from Cecropia, the son of <note type="footnote"> 1 The Xunian lake is in Thessaly. The Scholiast says it was so <lb/>

            goodly Teleon, and Phalerus of the stout ashen spear. <lb/>
            Alcon, his sire, had sent him forth, albeit he had no other <lb/>
            sons to nurse the evening of his life ; yet for all he was <lb/>
            his well-beloved,1 yea, his only-begotten, still would he <lb/>
            send him to win renown among those heroes bold.</p>
          <p>But Theseus, who far excelled all the sons of Erechtheus, <lb/>
            did an unseen2 bond keep back beneath the land of Tænarus, <lb/>
            for thither had he gone along with Peirithous. Verily <lb/>
            these twain might3 have made the accomplishment of their <lb/>
            toil lighter for them all.</p>
          <p>And Tiphys, son of Hagnias, left his Thespian folk in <lb/>
            Siphas ; a cunning prophet he to foretell a rising tumult <lb/>
            amid the waves of the wide sea, and cunning to divine <lb/>
            storms of wind and the course of a ship from the sun and <lb/>
            the stars. Him did Tritonian Athene herself rouse to the <lb/>
            gathering of the chiefs, and he came amongst men eager for <lb/>
            his coming ; for it was Athene, too, that builded the swift <lb/>
            ship, and with her had Argus, son of Arestor, fashioned it <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">τηλύγετος</foreign>. Whatever be the derivation of this much-disputed word, <lb/>
            one meaning seems to cling to it throughout Apollonius Rhodius, and it <lb/>
            is to be remembered that the Alexandrine usage of words does not <lb/>
            necessarily correspond with that of earlier writers. The Alexandrine <lb/>
            etymology was not unfrequently very faulty ; and so in translating this <lb/>
            doubtful Homeric word as "well-beloved," from the idea of affection <lb/>
            naturally attaching to the last born child, we shall be following the <lb/>
            meaning of the author, although perhaps he misunderstood the word <lb/>
            himself. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀίδηλος</foreign>. Apollonius greatly affects the use of Homeric words, <lb/>
            though not by any means always in their Homeric sense, which possibly <lb/>
            was misinterpreted by the critics of Alexandria. The word <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀίδηλος</foreign> is <lb/>
            used here and elsewhere by the poet in the sense of " unseen," probably f <lb/>
            from a false etymology, though into a controversy upon Homeric words, <lb/>
            which are still in many cases " sub judice," we cannot here attempt to <lb/>
            enter. </note><note type="footnote"> Theseus, attempting to carry off Persephone from Hades, was over­ <lb/>

            by her counsels. Wherefore was Argo far the best of all <lb/>
            the barques that ever crossed the sea with oars.</p>
          <p>Next came Phlias from Aræthyrea, where he dwelt in <lb/>
            plenty by the grace of Dionysus, his father, in his home <lb/>
            by the springs of Asopus.</p>
          <p>From Argos came forth Talaus and Areius, two sons of <lb/>
            Bias; and mighty Leodocus, whom Pero, daughter of <lb/>
            Neleus, bare; for her sake Melampus, son of Æolus, <lb/>
            endured grievous misery in the steading of Iphiclus.</p>
          <p>Nor are we told that mighty Heracles, stout of heart, <lb/>
            made light of the earnest prayer of the son of Æson. Nay, <lb/>
            when he heard the report that the heroes were gathering, <lb/>
            he changed his path anew from Arcadia and came to <lb/>
            Lyrceian Argos, whither he was bringing alive a boar that <lb/>
            battened in the glens of Lampeia 1 beside the vast marsh of <lb/>
            Erymanthus ; and he cast him down from off his mighty <lb/>
            back, fast bound in chains, at the entrance to the assembly <lb/>
            of the Mycenæans, while himself started off as he listed <lb/>
            against the purpose of Eurystheus; and with him came <lb/>
            Hylas, his trusty squire, in the bloom of youth, to bear his <lb/>
            arrows and to keep his bow.</p>
          <p>Next came the son of divine Danaus, Nauplius. Lo! <lb/>
            he was son of Clytoneus, the child of Naubolus; and <lb/>
            Naubolus was the son of Lernus; and of Lernus we are <lb/>
            told that he was the son of Prœtus, whom Nauplius begat; <lb/>
            for the maid Amymone, daughter of Danaus, in days gone <lb/>
            by, bare, from the embraces of Poseidon, Nauplius, who far <lb/>
            excelled all men in seamanship.</p>
          <p>And last of those, who dwelt in Argos, came Idmon; <lb/>
            for he would be there, although from augury he knew his <lb/>
            fate; lest the people should grudge him a fair fame. He, <lb/>
            of a truth, was no son of Abas, but the child of Leto him­ <lb/>
            self begat him to swell the number of the famous race of <note type="footnote"> 1 A mountain in Arcadia, in which the river Erymanthus rises. </note> <pb n="9"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="L. 112-173.]"/><lb/>
            Æolus ;1 yea, and himself did teach him divination, and to <lb/>
            heed the flight of birds, and to read signs in blazing fire.</p>
          <p>Moreover, Ætolian Leda sent forth from Sparta strong <lb/>
            Polydeuces and Castor, skilled to curb fleet steeds; these, <lb/>
            her well-beloved sons, she bare at one birth in the halls of <lb/>
            Tyndarus, and when they would go she said not nav, for <lb/>
            her thoughts were worthy the bride of Zeus.</p>
          <p>From Arene came the sons of Apharetus, Lynceus and <lb/>
            Idas, of overweening pride, both too confident in their great <lb/>
            strength; and Lynceus too excelled in the keenness of his <lb/>
            sight, if that is really a true legend, that he could see with <lb/>
            ease a man even beneath the earth.</p>
          <p>And with them Periclymenus, son of Neleus, started to go, <lb/>
            eldest of all the children that were born to divine Neleus <lb/>
            in Pylos ; him Poseidon gifted with boundless might, and <lb/>
            granted that2 whatsoever he should pray to be during the <lb/>
            fray, that should he become in the stress of battle.</p>
          <p>Again, from Arcadia came Amphidamas and Cepheus, <lb/>
            who dwelt in Tegea, the heritage of Apheidas, the two sons <lb/>
            of Aleus ; and eke a third followed in their train, Ancaeus, <lb/>
            whom his own father Lycurgus was sending ; he was elder <lb/>
            brother to those twain, but was left behind in the city that <lb/>
            he might care for Aleus in his old age, but he sent his own <lb/>
            son to join his brethren. And the young man went on his <lb/>
            way, brandishing the skin of a bear of Mænalus, and in his <lb/>
            right hand a great two-edged axe. For his grandsire <lb/>
            Aleus had hidden his weapons in an inner closet, if haply <lb/>
            he might stay him even yet from setting out.</p>
          <p>There came too Augeas, who, legend saith, is son to <lb/>
            Helios; and over the men of Elis this prince held sway, <note type="footnote"> 1 Æolus, the son of Hellen, had two sons, Cretheus and Athamas; <lb/>

            glorying in his wealth; but greatly did he long to see the land <lb/>
            of Colchis and Æetes in person, the leader of the Colchians.</p>
          <p>And Asterius and Amphion, sons of Hyperasius, came <lb/>
            from Achæan Pellene, which on a day their grandsire <lb/>
            Pelles founded on the crags by the sea-shore.</p>
          <p>To these, again, came Euphemus, leaving Tænarus, he <lb/>
            it was whom Europe, daughter of Tityus, of giant strength, <lb/>
            bare, outstripping all in speed of foot. He would run <lb/>
            upon the sea's gray swell, and never wet his swift feet; <lb/>
            but, moistening just the soles thereof, he sped along his <lb/>
            watery1 path.</p>
          <p>And there came two other sons of Poseidon; the one, to <lb/>
            wit, Erginus, who had left the town of noble Miletus; the <lb/>
            other, Ancæus, the proud, who had come from Parthenie, <lb/>
            seat of Imbrasian2 Hera; both these boasted their knowledge <lb/>
            of seacraft and of war.</p>
          <p>Next came valiant Meleager, son of Œneus, having <lb/>
            started from Calydon, and Laocoon too, who was brother <lb/>
            of (Eneus; yet were they not sons of one mother, but him <lb/>
            did a bondwoman bear; he it was whom Œneus sent, now <lb/>
            that he was grown up, to guard his child; so while yet a <lb/>
            youth he entered that brave band of heroes, and none, me­ <lb/>
            thinks, mightier than he had come, save Heracles alone, if <lb/>
            he had stayed but one year 3 longer there and been trained <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὸιερή</foreign>. The meaning of this word in this passage at any rate is <lb/>
            clearer than its etymology. From the context it obviously =" wet," <lb/>

            <foreign xml:lang="grc">λύκη βαίνω</foreign> = the path of light, i.e. the sun's course, i.e. the year ; but <lb/>

            up amongst the Ætolians. And lo ! his uncle Iphiclus, the <lb/>
            son of Thestius, bare him company on that journey, a <lb/>
            spearman good, and skilled enow as well to match himself <lb/>
            with any in close fight.</p>
          <p>And with him was Palaemonius, son of Lernus, of Olenus ; <lb/>
            son of Lernus men called him, but he drew his lineage from <lb/>
            Hephæstus, wherefore he was lame of foot; but none would <lb/>
            have the hardihood to scorn his form and manliness, where­ <lb/>
            fore he too was numbered amongst the other chiefs, swel­ <lb/>
            ling the fame of Jason.</p>
          <p>From the Phocians then came Iphitus, sprung from <lb/>
            Naubolus, son of Ornytus; now he had been Jason's host <lb/>
            aforetime when he came to Pytho to ask an oracle about <lb/>
            his voyage; for there did Iphitus receive him in his halls.</p>
          <p>Next came the sons of Boreas, Calais and Zetes, whom, <lb/>
            on a day, Oreithyia, daughter of Erechtheus, bare to Boreas <lb/>
            at the verge of wintry Thrace ; thither it was that Thraciau <lb/>
            Boreas had snatched her away from Cecropia, as she was <lb/>
            circling in the dance by the banks of the Ilissus. And <lb/>
            from afar he brought her to the spot men call Sarpedon's <lb/>
            rock, beside the stream of the river Erginus, and there he <lb/>
            shrouded her in dark clouds, and had his will of her. <lb/>
            These his two sons made strong pinions move on either <lb/>
            ancle as they rose, a mighty marvel to behold, radiant with <lb/>
            scales of gold; and about their backs, from the crown of <lb/>
            the head and on. either side the neck, dark hair was waving <lb/>
            in the breeze.</p>
          <p>Nor yet had Acastus, son of stalwart Pelias himself, any <lb/>
            longing to abide within his father's house ; nor Argus <lb/>
            either, servant of the goddess Athene; nay, for they too, I <lb/>
            ween, were to be counted in the muster.</p>
          <p>This, then, is the tale of those who gathered to the son <lb/>
            of Æson to aid him with their counsel; whom the neigh­ <lb/>
            bouring folk called Minyan chieftains, one and all, since <lb/>
            most of them, and those the best, avowed them to be of the <pb n="12"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BOOK I."/><lb/>
            blood of the daughters of Minyas ; even so Alcimede, the <lb/>
            mother of Jason himself, was sprung from Clymene, a <lb/>
            daughter of Minyas.</p>
          <p>Now when the thralls had made all things ready, where­ <lb/>
            with ships are furnished for their freight, whenso business <lb/>
            calls men to make a voyage across the sea; in that hour <lb/>
            they betook them to the ship through the city to the place <lb/>
            men call the headland of Pagasæ,1 in Magnesia ; and around <lb/>
            them a crowd of folk ran thronging eagerly; but they <lb/>
            showed like bright stars amid clouds, and thus would each <lb/>

            “ King Zeus, what is the intent of Pelias ? whither is he <lb/>
            sending such a muster of heroes from out the Panachæan 2 <lb/>
            land ? They will sack the homes of Æetes with baleful fire <lb/>
            the very day they see them, if so be he give them not the <lb/>
            fleece of his own accord. But the voyage may not be <lb/>
            shunned, nor shall their toil be fruitless, if they go."</p>
          <p>So spake they, one here, one there throughout the city; <lb/>
            and the women lifted up their hands full oft toward <lb/>
            heaven to the immortal gods, praying that they would <lb/>
            grant the accomplishment of their return as their heart <lb/>
            desired. And one to another would thus complain through <lb/>
            her tears: " Ah, hapless Alcimede, to thee too hath sorrow <lb/>
            come, late though it be, nor hast thou finished thy course <lb/>
            with joy. Surely Æson is a man of sorrows, and that in no <lb/>
            small measure. Yea, better for him had it been, if ere this <lb/>
            he had been wrapped in his shroud3 and were lying 'neath <lb/>
            the earth, a stranger still to evil enterprises. Would that <lb/>

            on the day that the maiden Helle perished! But no ! that <lb/>
            prodigy of ill uttered1 a human voice, that it might bring <lb/>
            grief and countless woes to Alcimede, in days to come."</p>
          <p>Thus would the women speak as the heroes went on their <lb/>
            way forth. And many thralls, both men and maids, were <lb/>
            already gathering, and his mother flung herself on Jason's <lb/>
            neck. For piercing grief had entered each woman's breast; <lb/>
            and with her his father, bowed by baleful age, made moan <lb/>
            upon his bed, closely veiled from head to foot.</p>
          <p>And Jason, the while, was soothing their grief with <lb/>
            words of comfort; but he signed to the thralls to take up <lb/>
            his weapons of war, and they in silence and with downcast2 <lb/>
            look took them up. But his mother, so soon as she had <lb/>
            thrown her arms around her boy, so clung to him, while <lb/>
            her sobs3 came ever more thick and fast; as when a maiden <lb/>
            in her solitude is fain to cast her arms about her gray­ <lb/>
            haired nurse and weep, one who hath none left to defend <lb/>
            her, but she leads a cruel life under a step-mother, who ill­ <lb/>
            treats her tender years with many a flout; and as she <lb/>
            weeps, her heart within her is held fast in misery, nor can <lb/>
            she utter4 half the grief she yearneth to; even thus was Al­ <lb/>
            cimede weeping loud and long, as she held her son in her <lb/>
            arms. And in her affliction she spake this word: " Ah ! <lb/>
            would that I had straight given up the ghost and so for­ <lb/>

            admired by the Achæan women, be left like a slave in my <lb/>

            over whom I once had much joy and glory, my only son for <lb/>
            whom I loosed my maiden zone1 for the first time and the <lb/>

          <p>Thus was she, poor lady, sobbing and wailing, and the <lb/>
            women her handmaids took up the wail in turn, but Jason <lb/>
            spake to her softly with words of comfort: " Mother mine, <lb/>
            lay not such piteous grief on me thus all too much, for by <lb/>
            thy tears shalt thou not keep from suffering; nay, thou <lb/>
            wilt join sorrow on to sorrow. For the gods allot to <lb/>
            mortals woes they cannot see. Take heart to bear the lot <lb/>
            of mortals for all thy heaviness of soul, and cheer thee with <lb/>
            the solemn promise of Athene and with the god's answer, <lb/>
            for very favourable was the word of Phœbus, and after <lb/>
            these with the aid of the chieftains. But now do thou <lb/>
            with thy handmaidens abide quietly within the house, and <lb/>
            be not a bird of ill omen to our ship; for my clansmen and <lb/>
            my thralls shall lead me on my way thither."</p>
          <p>He spake, and forth from the house started on his path. <lb/>
            Even as Apollo goes forth from his fragrant shrine through <lb/>
            holy Delos, or Claros, or through Pytho, in his might, or <lb/>

            of men giving commands all together. And there met him <lb/>
            Iphias, the aged priestess of Artemis, protectress of the <lb/>
            city; and she clasped him by his right hand but could not , <lb/>
            say a word for all her longing, since the crowd went hasting <lb/>
            on ; so she turned aside and left him there, as an old dame <lb/>
            must before younger folk; and lo! he passed by and was <lb/>
            gone far away.</p>
          <p>Now when he had left the streets of the town with their <lb/>
            fair buildings, and was come to the headland of Pagasæ ; <lb/>
            there did his comrades welcome him, abiding together be­ <lb/>
            side the ship Argo. There she stood at the river mouth, <lb/>
            and they were gathered over against her; when lo ! they <lb/>
            saw Acastus and with him Argus coming forth from the <lb/>
            city to them, and they marvelled to see them hasting thither <lb/>
            with all speed, against the will of Pelias. And the one, <lb/>
            Argus, son of Arestor, had fastened about his shoulders a <lb/>
            bull's hide, reaching to his feet, black, with the hair upon <lb/>
            it; but the other had a fair mantle of double woof, which <lb/>
            his sister Pelopeia gave to him. But Jason refrained for <lb/>
            all that from questioning the pair on each point, but bade <lb/>
            them seat themselves at the assembly; for there were they <lb/>
            sitting one and all in rows on furled sails and the mast <lb/>
            that lay upon the ground. And amongst them the son of <lb/>
            Æson spake with good intent, " For the rest, whatsoever a <lb/>
            ship should be furnished withal lies ready against our start, <lb/>
            for all hath been done well and in order; therefore no long <lb/>
            space will we hold back from our voyage on that account, <lb/>
            when but the winds blow fair. Nay but, friends, since our <lb/>
            return to Hellas again is for all of us, and for all is the <lb/>
            voyage to the land of Æetes, choose ye therefore now un­ <lb/>
            grudgingly the best of you for leader, to whom each thing <lb/>
            shall be a care, to take upon him our quarrels and our <lb/>
            covenants with strangers."</p>
          <p>So spake he : and the young men looked round at bold <lb/>
            Heracles sitting in their midst; and with one shout they <pb n="16"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BOOK I."/><lb/>
            bade Jason declare him leader; but he forthwith, from <lb/>
            where he sat, stretched out his right hand and uttered his <lb/>
            voice, "Let none offer this honour to me. For I will never <lb/>
            consent; wherefore I will even stay another from rising up. <lb/>
            Let him who gathered us together, also lead the throng."</p>
          <p>So spake he in the greatness of his heart; and they <lb/>
            would have it as Heracles bade. Then arose warlike Jason <lb/>
            himself in his gladness, and to his eager listeners thus made <lb/>
            harangue : " If then 'tis your will that your fame be in my <lb/>
            hands, no longer let the voyage be delayed as hitherto. <lb/>
            Now forthwith let us appease Phœbus with sacrifice and <lb/>
            make a feast at once; and whilst my thralls, the overseers <lb/>
            of my steadings, go forth, whose business it is to make good <lb/>
            choice of oxen and drive them hither from the herd; mean­ <lb/>
            time will we drag the ship to sea, and do ye place all the <lb/>
            tackling therein and allot the oars amongst the benches; <lb/>
            and let us the while build an altar on the strand to Apollo, <lb/>
            lord of embarkation, who in answer to my prayer hath <lb/>
            promised to declare and show the passage o'er the sea, if <lb/>
            1 haply by sacrifice to him I may begin my contest with the <lb/>
            king."</p>
          <p>So spake he, and was the first to turn him to the work, <lb/>
            and they rose up obedient to him ; and they piled up their <lb/>
            garments apart in rows on a smooth ledge of rock, over <lb/>
            which the sea burst not with its waves, but long ago the <lb/>
            stormy brine had washed it clean. First then by the coun­ <lb/>
            sels of Argus they lashed the ship stoutly with a well­ <lb/>
            twisted cable from within, stretching it on either side, that <lb/>
            the timbers might hold fast by their bolts and have strength <lb/>
            to meet the breakers.1 And quickly they scooped out a <note type="footnote"> 1 The account of the launching of Argo is by no means easy to <lb/>
            understand in all its details. It seems that the heroes dug a trench in <lb/>
            front of the bows of the ship and a little way beneath her; then, as she <lb/>
            tilted forward of her own weight, they placed rollers under her keel, <lb/>
            and continued their trench at a somewhat greater depth, and so on, at a </note> <pb n="17"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="L. 343-395.]."/><lb/>
            space as wide as the ship's girth encompassed, and about <lb/>
            the prow into the deep they dug out all that she would <lb/>
            take to run in, when they hauled her down. And ever in <lb/>
            front of the keel they kept hollowing deeper in the ground, <lb/>
            and in the furrow did they lay smooth rollers, and on to <lb/>
            the first of these they tilted her forward, that she might <lb/>
            slide along them and be carried on. And above, on this <lb/>
            side and on that, they laid the oars across the ship, so as to <lb/>
            project a cubit, and they bound them to the tholes; while <lb/>
            they stood there on either side at alternate oars and pushed <lb/>
            with hand and chest together. And amongst them went <lb/>
            Tiphys to encourage the young men to push in time. <lb/>
            Loudly he shouted to urge them, and they at once leant on <lb/>
            with all their might, and thrust her with one rush right <lb/>
            from out her place, while with their feet they strained <lb/>
            and strove ; and lo! Pelian Argo went with them very <lb/>
            swiftly, and they darted from her sides with a cheer. Be­ <lb/>
            neath her heavy keel the rollers groaned at the friction, and <lb/>
            around them dark smoke and flame leapt1 up beneath the <lb/>
            weight, and into the sea she slid. Then did they check her <lb/>
            onward course and held her with a rope. And they fitted <lb/>
            oars on both sides to the tholes, and laid the mast and <lb/>
            shapely sails and stores within her.</p>
          <p>Now when they had taken careful heed to each thing, <lb/>
            first they portioned out the benches by lot, two men being <note type="footnote"> lower and lower grade, until they eased her down to the water's edge. <lb/>
            After this, apparently (cf. 1. 278), they placed oars right across the ship <lb/>
            from side to side, so that the blades protruded on one side, the handles <lb/>
            on the other, alternately; then making these fast with cords to the <lb/>
            tholes, they used them to push against, and so thrust Argo into deep <lb/>
            water with a rush. </note><note type="footnote"> If this is what the poet intends, we should have to assume that the <lb/>

            told off to one bench, but the midmost bench, apart from <lb/>
            the other heroes, did they select for Heracles and Ancæus, <lb/>
            who dwelt in the citadel of Tegea. For them alone they <lb/>
            left the middle seat, at once, without casting lots ; and <lb/>
            with one accord they entrusted Tiphys to mind the helm of <lb/>
            their ship with her good keel.</p>
          <p>Next, hard by the sea, they raised a pile of shingle, and <lb/>
            builded an altar there upon the strand to Apollo, naming <lb/>
            it after him who holds the shore and favours those who go <lb/>
            aboard. And quickly they laid thereon logs of dry olive; <lb/>
            meantime, the herdsmen of the son of Æson drove before <lb/>
            them from the herd two oxen ; these the young men of his <lb/>
            crew dragged to the altar, while others then held the lustral1 <lb/>
            water and meal for sprinkling nigh. And Jason called <lb/>
            upon Apollo, the god of his fathers, and prayed, " Hearken, <lb/>
            O king, who dwellest in Pagasæ and the city of Æson, that <lb/>
            is called after my sire, thou who didst promise me when I <lb/>
            sought to thee at Pytho to show me the accomplishment <lb/>
            and end of my journey. For 'twas thou thyself that wast <lb/>
            the cause2 of the enterprise. Do thou then bring my ship <lb/>
            with my comrades safe and sound hither back to Hellas. <lb/>
            Then in thy honour will we lay hereafter on thy altar noble <lb/>
            sacrifices of bulls for all of us who shall return, and other <lb/>
            gifts will I bring to Pytho, and others to Ortygia in count­ <lb/>
            less number. Come then and receive this sacrifice at our <lb/>
            hands, far-darting god ; which we have set before thee; a <lb/>
            first gift, as an offering for our embarking on this ship; <lb/>

          <p>He spake, and, as he prayed, cast the barley-meal. And <lb/>
            those twain, Ancæus the proud and Heracles, girt them­ <lb/>
            selves to slay the steers. Now the one smote with his club <lb/>
            the middle of the head about the forehead, and forthwith <lb/>
            the ox lay fallen in a heap upon the earth. But Ancæus <lb/>
            struck the other on his broad neck with a brazen axe and <lb/>
            cleft the strong sinews, and down he tumbled, doubled up1 <lb/>
            upon his horns. Quickly then their comrades cut the <lb/>
            oxen's throats, and flayed their hides ; next broke them up <lb/>
            and carved them, cutting out the sacred thighs, which they <lb/>
            wrapped closely in fat all together and burnt upon firewood. <lb/>
            Next the son of Æson poured pure libations; and Idmon <lb/>
            was glad, when he saw the flame blaze up on every side <lb/>
            from the sacrifice and the smoke thereof leaping up favour­ <lb/>
            ably in dark-gleaming wreaths ; and forthwith he declared <lb/>
            outright the will of the son of Leto.</p>
          <p>" Lo! it is the will of heaven and your destiny to come <lb/>
            hither again bringing the fleece with you, but countless <lb/>
            toils meantime await you as you come and go. But for <lb/>
            me 'tis fated to die by the hateful doom of a god, some­ <lb/>
            where far away on Asia's strand. Even so came I forth <lb/>
            from my fatherland, though I knew my doom a while ago <lb/>
            from evil omens, that I might embark upon the ship, and <lb/>
            fair fame be left me in my home for my embarking."</p>
          <p>So spake he: and the young warriors heard his prophecy <lb/>
            and were glad for their return, though grief seized them <lb/>
            for the fate of Idmon. Now when the sun had passed the <lb/>

            edge, and beside them lay vast stores of food and sweet <lb/>
            mead, which cupbearers drew forth in beakers ; next they <lb/>
            told each other tales in turn, such tales as young men oft <lb/>
            love to tell for their pastime1 o'er the feast and wine, what <lb/>
            time the spirit of insatiate violence is far away. Now the <lb/>
            son of Æson the while was lost in wonder, and was ponder­ <lb/>
            ing each matter within himself like to one downcast, when <lb/>
            lo! Idas noted him askance, and with loud voice railed upon <lb/>
            him, " Thou son of Æson, what plan is this thou turnest <lb/>
            over in thy heart ? Speak out thy will here in the midst. <lb/>
            Is it fear, that bugbear of cowards, that is coming upon <lb/>
            thee and mastering thee ? Be witness 'twixt us now, my <lb/>
            impetuous spear, wherewith I win myself renown far be­ <lb/>
            yond other men in the wars, nor is it Zeus that helpeth me <lb/>
            the half as much as this my spear,—yea, let it witness that <lb/>
            there shall come no deadly woe, and that no task shall re­ <lb/>
            main unaccomplished while Idas is with thee, even though <lb/>
            a god should rise up against us. Such a man am I whom <lb/>
            thou art bringing from Arene to thy aid."</p>
          <p>He spake; and grasping in both hands a full goblet drank <lb/>
            off the pure sweet mead, and his lips and dark cheeks were <lb/>
            wet with wine; but those others raised a din all together, <lb/>
            and Idmon lifted up his voice and spake, " God help thee,2 <lb/>

            Is it that the pure mead makes thy bold heart to swell <lb/>

            sons of Aloeus,1 men of old time, did sputter forth against <lb/>
            the blessed gods; and to them thou art nowise equal in <lb/>
            manhood ; yet were they both laid low by the swift arrows <lb/>
            of the son of Leto, for all their bravery."</p>
          <p>He ended; and Idas, son of Aphareus, laughed aloud his <lb/>
            fill; and, with blinking2 eyes, answered him with mocking <lb/>
            words, " Come now, tell me this by thy divination, whether <lb/>
            for me too the gods are fulfilling such another doom, as <lb/>
            that father of thine gave unto the sons of Aloeus. And <lb/>

            else shalt thou die for telling a prophecy light3 as the <lb/>
            winds."</p>
          <p>Thus in his wrath he upbraided him; and the quarrel <lb/>
            would have gone further, had not their comrades and the <lb/>
            son of Æson himself called to them with one accord and <lb/>
            stayed them from their strife. Then too Orpheus lifted <lb/>
            up his lyre in his left hand and made essay to sing. He <lb/>
            sang how earth, and heaven, and sea, once all joined <lb/>
            together in unity, were separated, each apart, after a <lb/>
            deadly quarrel; and how, for ever in heaven, the stars, <lb/>
            and moon, and the paths of the sea have their steadfast <lb/>
            goal; and how the mountains rose up, and how rivers <lb/>
            rushing noisily with their nymphs, and all creeping things <lb/>
            came into being. Next he sang how, at the first, Ophion <lb/>
            and Eurynome, daughter of Oceanus, held sway o'er snow- <note type="footnote"> 1 The sons of Aloeus were Otus and Ephialtes, two enormous giants, <lb/>

            heaven by piling Pelion on Ossa, which, says Homer, they would have <lb/>

            capped Olympus, and how the one yielded up his honours <lb/>
            to the mighty hands of Cronus, while she gave way to <lb/>
            Rhea, and they plunged 'neath the waves of ocean. Awhile <lb/>
            did these lord it over the blessed Titan gods, whilst Zeus <lb/>
            was yet a child and thought as a child in his home beneath <lb/>
            the Cave1 of Dicte, for not yet had the earth-born Cyclopes <lb/>
            made strong his hands with bolts of flashing lightning, <lb/>
            for 'tis these that bring glory to Zeus.</p>
          <p>He ended, and checked his lyre and voice divine; but <lb/>
            they, as he ceased, still leant their heads towards him with <lb/>
            eager ears, one and all hushed but hungry still by his en­ <lb/>
            chantment, so strong a spell of music had he left within <lb/>
            their hearts. But not long after did they mix libations for <lb/>
            Zeus, as was his due, and piously poured them on the <lb/>
            blazing tongues,2 and so bethought them of sleep for the <lb/>
            night.</p>
          <p>Now when the radiant Dawn with bright eyes looked <lb/>
            forth upon the high mountain-tops of Pelias, and the <lb/>
            headlands of the tossing main were swept into clear view <lb/>
            before the breeze; in that hour uprose Tiphys, and at <lb/>
            once he bade his comrades go aboard and make ready the <lb/>
            oars. And strangely did the harbour of Pagasæ, yea, and <lb/>
            Pelian Argo herself cry aloud, urging them to set forth. <lb/>
            For within Argo was laid one beam3 divine; this it was <lb/>
            that Athene made of oak from Dodona, and fitted all along <lb/>
            the keel. So they went up upon the benches one after <lb/>
            another, as before they had allotted to each in his place to <lb/>
            • row, and sat them down in order beside their gear. And <lb/>
            in the midst sat Ancæus and Heracles, that mighty man, <note type="footnote">1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Δικτα</foreign>ĩ<foreign xml:lang="grc">ον</foreign>, i.e. Cretan, from the cave Dicte in Crete, where Zeus <lb/>
            was brought up. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 The tongues of the victims were burnt as a sacrifice to Hermes at <lb/>

            and nigh to him he set his club, and beneath his tread the <lb/>
            ship's keel sank deep. And now were the cables drawn in, <lb/>
            and they poured a cup of mead upon the sea. And Jason <lb/>
            with a tear turned his eyes away from his fatherland.</p>
          <p>But they, like young men who range themselves to <lb/>
            dance to Phœbus, either in Pytho, or haply in Ortygia or <lb/>
            by the waters of Ismenus, and all together and in time <lb/>
            they beat the ground with nimble feet to the sound of the <lb/>
            lyre round his altar; even so they in time to the lyre of <lb/>
            Orpheus smote with their oars the boisterous water of the <lb/>
            deep, and the waves went dashing by, while on this side <lb/>
            and on that the dark brine bubbled up in foam, boiling <lb/>
            terribly 'neath the might of those strong men. And their <lb/>
            harness flashed like flame in the sunlight as the ship sped <lb/>
            on, while ever far behind their course was white with foam, <lb/>
            like a track seen over a grassy plain.</p>
          <p>On that day all the gods looked down from heaven at <lb/>
            the ship, and those men of courage half divine, who then <lb/>
            were sailing o'er the sea, a picked crew ; and upon the tops <lb/>
            of peaks stood the Pelian nymphs, marvelling to see the <lb/>
            work of Itonian Athene, and the heroes too, wielding their <lb/>
            oars in their hands. Yea, and from a mountain-top came <lb/>
            another nigh unto the sea, Chiron,1 son of Philyra, and he <lb/>
            wetted his feet where the gray waves break, and with his <lb/>
            weighty hand he waved them on full oft, chanting the <lb/>
            while as they went a returning free from sorrow. And <lb/>
            with him his wife, bearing on her arm Achilles, son of <lb/>
            Peleus, sent a greeting to his dear father.</p>
          <p>But when they had left the rounded headland of the <lb/>
            harbour by the cunning and skill of Tiphys, wise son of <lb/>
            Hagnias, who deftly handled the polished helm to guide <lb/>
            the ship stedfastly, then did they set up the mighty mast <lb/>
            in the cross-plank, and made it fast with stays, drawing <note type="footnote"> 1 Peleus had entrusted his child to Chiron to be brought up, on the <lb/>

            them taut on either side, and they spread the sails upon <lb/>
            it, stretching them along the yard-arm. Therewith a fresh <lb/>
            fair wind fell on them, so they fastened the ropes on the <lb/>
            deck to polished pins, set at intervals, and quietly they <lb/>
            sped beneath the long headland 1 of Tisa. And for them the <lb/>
            son of (Eager touched his lyre and sang in rhythmic song <lb/>
            of Artemis, daughter of a noble sire, protectress of ships, <lb/>
            who keepeth 'neath her care those peaks by the sea and <lb/>
            7 the land of Iolchos; and the fishes darting beneath the <lb/>
            deep sea, great and small together, followed bounding <lb/>
            through the watery ways. As when, in the track of the <lb/>
            shepherd, countless sheep follow to the fold filled to the <lb/>
            full with grass, while he goeth before them gaily piping <lb/>
            some shepherd's madrigal on his shrill pipe ; even so did <lb/>
            the fishes follow with them, and ever onward the steady <lb/>
            wind bare Argo.</p>
          <p>Anon the misty2 land of the Pelasgi, with its many corn- <lb/>
            fields, sank out of sight; and past the Pelian cliffs they <lb/>
            went, speeding ever onward; then the Sepian3 headland <lb/>
            opened to them, and Sciathus4 by the sea came in view, and <lb/>
            in the distance were seen the Peiresian headlands and the <lb/>
            headland of Magnesia, calm and clear upon the mainland, <lb/>
            and the cairn of Dolops; there they beached their ship <lb/>
            at eve, as the wind veered round, and in honour of Dolops <lb/>
            they burnt victims at nightfall by the swell of the heaving <lb/>
            deep. And two days they rested on the beach, but on the <lb/>
            third they put forth the ship, stretching the wide canvas <lb/>
            aloft; wherefore men still call that beach the loosing <lb/>

            and stormy strand. And at dawn they saw Homole close <lb/>
            to them lying on the deep, and past it they steered, nor <lb/>
            was it long before they were to sail away from the streams <lb/>
            of the river Amyrus. From thence they beheld Eurymenæ, <lb/>
            and the sea-beat ravines of Ossa and Olympus ; and then <lb/>
            speeding on by the breath of the wind they reached at <lb/>
            night the slopes of Pallene, beyond the headland of <lb/>
            Canastra.2 Now, as they fared on in the morning, the <lb/>

            shadows with its crest Lemnos, lying as far away as a well­ <lb/>

            strained to it. But at sunset, when the wind fell, they <lb/>

            exact no vengeance thereafter for the pitiful murder. Alone <lb/>
            of all the women Hypsipyle spared Thoas her aged father, <lb/>
            who indeed was king over the people ; but him she sent to <lb/>
            drift o'er the sea in a hollow ark, if haply he might escape. <lb/>
            Him did fisher-folk bring safe to an island, formerly called <lb/>

            cattle, and the donning of bronze harness, and ploughing <lb/>
            the wheat-bearing tilth was an easier lot than the toils 1 of <lb/>
            Athene, whereat ever aforetime they busied them. Yet <lb/>
            for all that full oft would they peer across the broad sea in <lb/>
            grievous dread against the coming of the Thracians. Where­ <lb/>
            fore when they saw Argo rowing near the island, forth­ <lb/>
            with in all speed they did on their warlike gear, and <lb/>
            poured down to the beach from out the gates of Myrine, <lb/>
            like to Thyades who eat raw flesh, for they thought that <lb/>

            and all, and come together, forthwith amongst them she <lb/>
            made eager harangue.</p>
          <p>" My friends, come now, let us give the men gifts in <lb/>
            plenty, all that men should have to carry on a ship, food <lb/>
            and sweet mead, that so they may abide steadfastly outside <lb/>
            our battlements, and may not in pursuit of their business <lb/>
            get to know us too well, and a foul report spread far and <lb/>
            wide; for we have wrought a great deed, which will not be <lb/>
            wholly to their liking, if they should learn it. Let this be <lb/>
            our plan now in this matter. But if any of you can devise <lb/>
            better counsel, let her arise, for to this end did I call you <lb/>
            hither."</p>
          <p>So spake she, and sat down on her father's seat of stone. <lb/>
            And next'uprose her dear nurse Polyxo, limping on feet <lb/>
            shrivelled with age, I trow, and leaning on a staff; and <lb/>
            she longed exceedingly to have her say. And by her, with <lb/>
            her white hair about her head, sat four unmarried maidens. <lb/>
            So she stood in the midst of the assembly, and raising ever <lb/>
            so little her bent and skinny back, she spake thus :</p>
          <p>" Gifts let us send to the strangers, as is pleasing <lb/>
            to Hypsipyle herself, for 'tis better to send them. But for <lb/>
            you, what plan have ye to keep your life, if a Thracian <lb/>
            army fall on you, or any other foe, as happeneth oft <pb n="28"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BOOK I."/><lb/>
            ’mongst men ? since even now yon host is come unex­ <lb/>
            pectedly. And if any one of the blessed gods turn this <lb/>
            aside, yet hereafter there await us countless other woes <lb/>
            worse than battle, when the aged women are dead, and ye <lb/>
            younger maidens reach a cheerless old age, childless. How <lb/>
            then will ye live, poor creatures? shall the oxen, yoked of <lb/>
            their own accord for you, drag the plough, that cleaves the <lb/>
            fallow, through the deep tilth, and straightway in the <lb/>
            fulness of the year reap the harvest ? Of a truth o'er me, <lb/>
            methinks, the earth shall lie this very year that cometh, <lb/>
            albeit the Fates have hitherto shrunk away from me, and <lb/>
            I shall get my meed of burial even thus, as is right, or <lb/>
            ever misfortune arrived But I bid you younger women <lb/>
            heed these things well. For now before you open stands <lb/>
            the door of escape, if but ye will give over to the care of <lb/>
            strangers your homes and all your booty and your glorious <lb/>
            town."</p>
          <p>So spake she, and through the assembly ran a murmur <lb/>
            of assent. For her saying pleased them well. But after <lb/>
            her at once Hypsipyle, again uprising, took up her parable <lb/>
            and said:</p>
          <p>" Why, then, if unto you all this purpose is pleasing, at <lb/>
            once will I send forth even a messenger to find their <lb/>
            ship."</p>
          <p>She spake, and called to Iphinoe sitting near, " Rouse <lb/>
            thee, Iphinoe, I pray, and beg yon' man who leads their <lb/>
            company to come unto us, that I may tell to him the word <lb/>
            that finds favour with my people, and bid his company, if <lb/>
            they will, set foot within our land and city boldly and with <lb/>
            a good heart."</p>
          <p>She spake, and broke up the assembly ; and then started <lb/>
            to go to her own house. And so Iphinoe came unto the <note type="footnote"> I i.e. it matters little to me what happens, for I feel assured my end <lb/>
            is very near, although the Fates have shrunk away so long from my <lb/>
            hideous form. <foreign xml:lang="grc">αὓως οὒτως</foreign>. </note> <pb n="29"/>

            Minyæ, who questioned her on what business bent she <lb/>
            came amongst them. And forthwith she thus made answer <lb/>
            with all haste to their questions, " Verily, 'twas the daughter <lb/>
            of Thoas, Hypsipyle, who sent me on my journey hither to <lb/>
            call the captain of the ship, whosoever he is, that she may <lb/>
            tell him somewhat that hath found favour with her folk ; <lb/>
            moreover she bids you, an you list, at once now set foot <lb/>
            within her land and city with a good heart."</p>
          <p>So spake she; and welcome to all was her fair message. <lb/>
            Now they imagined that Hypsipyle, the well-beloved <lb/>
            daughter of Thoas, did reign in his stead ; so quickly sent <lb/>
            they Jason on his way, yea, and themselves made ready <lb/>
            to go.</p>
          <p>Now he had buckled on his shoulders a purple mantle <lb/>
            of double woof, the handiwork of the Tritonian goddess, <lb/>
            which Pallas gave him, on that first day she laid down the <lb/>
            props for the ship Argo, and taught him to measure <lb/>
            cross-planks with the rule. More easily might you gaze <lb/>
            on the sun at his rising than on that mantle, or face the <lb/>
            sheen thereof. For lo! the middle was red, and the top <lb/>
            was all of purple, and on either end many cunning things <lb/>
            were worked passing well. On it were the Cyclopes sitting <lb/>
            at their work, that never decayeth, fashioning the thunder­ <lb/>
            bolt for king Zeus ; lo! it was all but made 1 in its bright <lb/>
            splendour, but yet it lacked one single flash, which they <lb/>
            with their hammers of iron were forging, with its breath <lb/>
            of fierce fire.</p>
          <p>On it were the two sons of Antiope, daughter of Asopus, <lb/>
            Amphion and Zethus; near by lay Thebes, as yet ungirt <lb/>
            with towers, whereof they were just laying the foundations <lb/>
            in eager haste. Zethus was bearing shoulder-high the top <note type="footnote"> 1 i.e. the bolt was all but finished; it only wanted one ray of light­ <lb/>
            ning to complete its composition; and so natural was the embroidery, <lb/>
            that the Cyclopes seemed to be in the very act of adding it. </note><note type="footnote"> The Cyclopes were Brontes and Steropes, i.e. Thunder and Lightning. </note> <pb n="30"/>

            of a steep mountain, like unto a man that toiled; and be­ <lb/>
            hind him came Amphion,l singing aloud to his golden lyre, <lb/>
            while in his track twice as large a rock followed.</p>
          <p>Next was worked thereon Cytherea, of the thick tresses, <lb/>
            carrying the nimble shield of Ares ; and from her shoulder, <lb/>
            from beneath her bosom, hung her girdle loosely over her <lb/>
            left arm; and there as she stood one seemed to see her <lb/>
            sure reflection thrown upon the brazen shield. And there <lb/>
            was a shaggy herd upon it; and the Teleboans2 and the <lb/>
            sons of Electryon were fighting about the cattle; these in <lb/>
            their defence, but those others, Taphian pirates, longing to <lb/>
            rob them; and the dewy meadow was wet with their blood, <lb/>
            and the many had the mastery of the few, even of the <lb/>
            herdsmen.</p>
          <p>Two chariots racing were fashioned there. Pelops drove <lb/>
            the one that was in front, shaking the reins, and with him <lb/>
            was Hippodamia for his companion ; while hard upon him <lb/>
            Myrtilus urged his steeds, and with him was (Enomaus, <lb/>
            gripping in his hand his couched lance, but down he fell as <lb/>
            the axle of the wheel break sideways in the nave, in his <lb/>
            eagerness to wound Pelops in the back.</p>
          <p>There too was broidered Phœbus Apollo, a big boy not <lb/>
            yet grown up, shooting at Tityos3 as he tried, with bold <lb/>
            hand, to snatch away his mother's veil,-great Tityos, <lb/>
            whose mother indeed was divine Elare, but the earth gave <lb/>
            him second birth, and brought him up. <note type="footnote">1 The legend was that Amphion, by playing on his lyre, drew the stones <lb/>
            after him till they ranged themselves in order on the battlements of Thebes. </note><note type="footnote">2 The Teleboans lived in the island of Taphos, one of the Echinades <lb/>
            group. They are notable pirates in Homer's Odyssee. </note><note type="footnote">3 The legend is given in two ways about the birth of the giant <lb/>
            Tityos. His mother Elare, the daughter of Orchomenus, was buried <lb/>
            alive when pregnant by Zeus, on account of the jealousy of Hera, but <lb/>
            Earth brought the child to birth. The other legend says that Elare <lb/>
            could not be delivered, so great was the child, and died in the effort; <lb/>
            whereon Earth bore the babe and reared him. </note></p><pb n="31"/>
            
          <p><note type="correspondsTo" n="L. 739-796.]"/>Yea, and Minyan Phrixus was there, even as though he <lb/>
            were really listening to the ram, while it was like to one <lb/>
            that spoke. Ah! shouldst thou see them, thou wouldst <lb/>
            be silent and deceive thy soul, expecting haply to hear <lb/>
            their voice aloud; and long mightest thou gaze thereon in <lb/>
            that hope.</p>
          <p>Such then were the presents of the Tritonian goddess <lb/>
            Athene. And in his right hand he held a spear, far-dart­ <lb/>
            ing, which on a day Atalanta gave to him in Mænalus as a <lb/>
            gift to a stranger, what time she met him graciously; for <lb/>
            greatly did she long to join him on that voyage; but yet of <lb/>
            himself and willingly he held her back, for he feared <lb/>
            grievous quarrels for her love.</p>
          <p>So he went on his way toward the city like a bright star, <lb/>
            which maidens through their curtains, newly made, do see, <lb/>
            when they awake, rising o'er their home, and through the <lb/>
            dark mist it charms their eyes with its lovely blush ; and <lb/>
            the maiden is cheered in her longing for the youth who is <lb/>
            amongst strange folk, for whom her parents are keeping <lb/>
            her to be his wedded wife; like to that star the hero <lb/>
            stepped along the path before the city. Now when they <lb/>
            were come within the gates of the city, the maidens of the <lb/>
            people surged behind them, glad to see the stranger ; but <lb/>
            he, with his eyes upon the ground, kept straight on, until <lb/>
            he reached the glorious halls of Hypsipyle ; and at his <lb/>
            appearing maids threw wide the folding-doors, fitted with <lb/>
            planks well wrought. Then did Iphinoe lead him hastily <lb/>
            through a fair hall, and seat him on a shining couch before <lb/>
            her mistress; but that lady cast down her eyes, and a <lb/>
            .blush stole o'er her maiden cheek; yet for all her modesty <lb/>
            found she wheedling word to address him withal: " Strange <lb/>
            sir, why sat ye thus so long outside our battlements ? for <lb/>
            our husbands abide not now within the city, but they are <lb/>
            sojourners awhile upon the Thracian mainland, and do <lb/>
            plough the wheat-bearing tilths. And I will tell thee <pb n="32"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BOOK I."/><lb/>
            truly all our trouble, that ye may know it surely for your­ <lb/>
            selves. When my father Thoas was king over the burghers, <lb/>
            then did bands of our folk start forth and plunder from <lb/>
            their ships the folds of the Thracians who dwell over <lb/>
            against us, and hither they brought endless booty and <lb/>
            maidens too. But Cypris, deadly goddess, schemed a <lb/>
            scheme, which cast upon them a fatal curse. For lo! <lb/>
            they loathed their wedded wives, and chased them from <lb/>
            their homes, yielding to their folly, and they took for con­ <lb/>
            cubines the captives of their spears, luckless wights ! Long <lb/>
            time did we endure, if haply they might change their mind <lb/>
            again at last; but ever the evil went on and doubled, for <lb/>
            they dishonoured their true children in their halls, and <lb/>
            there grew up a bastard race. And so maids unwed, and <lb/>
            widowed mothers with them, went wandering in neglect <lb/>
            through the city. Nor did a father care ever so little for <lb/>
            his daughter, though he saw her done to death before his <lb/>
            eyes by the hand of an insolent step-mother ; nor did chil­ <lb/>
            dren ward off unseemly outrage from their mother as <lb/>
            before, nor had brothers any thought for a sister. But <lb/>
            only captive maidens found favour at home and in the <lb/>
            dance, in the place of assembly, and at festivals, till some <lb/>
            god put overweening boldness in our hearts, that we <lb/>
            would no more receive them in our battlements on their <lb/>
            return from the Thracians, that so they might either be <lb/>
            minded aright, or start and go elsewhither, captive maids <lb/>
            and all. Thereon did they demand all the male children <lb/>
            that were left within the city, and went back again to the <lb/>
            place where still they dwell on the snowy ploughlands of <lb/>
            Thrace. Wherefore tarry ye here and sojourn ; and if, <lb/>
            indeed, thou wilt dwell here, and it find favour with thee, <lb/>
            verily then shalt thou have the honour of my father <lb/>
            Thoas. And methinks thou canst not scorn my land, <lb/>
            for very fruitful is it beyond all other isles that lie in <lb/>
            the Ægean sea. Nay, come now, get thee to thy ship,. <pb n="33"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="L. 797-864.]"/><lb/>
            and tell our words unto thy crew, and abide not outside <lb/>
            the city."</p>
          <p>So spake she, glozing over the murderous end that had <lb/>
            been worked upon the men; and Jason said to her in <lb/>
            answer, " Hypsipyle, lo! so shall we gain a request that is <lb/>
            very dear unto our hearts, which thou dost offer to our de­ <lb/>
            sire. But I will return again unto the city, when I have <lb/>
            told each thing in order. But thine, and thine alone be <lb/>
            the lordship of the island ; 'tis from no scorn that I shrink <lb/>
            therefrom, but upon me grievous toils press hard."</p>
          <p>He spake, and took her right hand, and at once went on <lb/>
            his way back; while about him throngs of maidens danced <lb/>
            on every side for very joy, till he passed outside the gates. <lb/>
            Next they went unto the shore, bearing on smoothly­ <lb/>
            running wains gifts full many for the strangers, as soon <lb/>
            as he had told them all the message from beginning to <lb/>
            end, even the word that Hypsipyle declared when she <lb/>
            summoned him. Yea, and they led the heroes to their <lb/>
            houses to entertain them, willingly. For Cypris stirred up <lb/>
            sweet desire5 for the sake of Hephæstus, the crafty; that so <lb/>
            Lemnos might again be inhabited by men in time to come <lb/>
            and get no hurt.</p>
          <p>Then did he, the son of Æson, start for the royal home <lb/>
            of Hypsipyle, but those others went whither chance led <lb/>
            each, all save Heracles, for he stayed by the ship of his <lb/>
            own free will, and with him a few chosen comrades. Anon <lb/>
            the city made merry with dance and feast, filled with the <lb/>
            smoke of steaming sacrifice; and beyond the rest of the <lb/>
            immortal gods did they propitiate the famous son of Hera, <lb/>
            yea, and Cypris too, with song and sacrifice. And ever <lb/>
            day by day was their voyage delayed, and long time would <lb/>
            they have tarried and rested there, had not Heracles assem­ <lb/>
            bled his companions, apart from the women, and thus up- <note type="footnote"> 1 Lemnos was sacred to Hephæstus, the husband of Aphrodite; so <lb/>

            braided them: " God help you, sirs! is it a kinsman's <lb/>
            . murder that keeps us from our country ? Was it for want <lb/>
            of weddings that we came from that land to this, scorning <lb/>
            the maidens of our people ? or is it your pleasure to dwell <lb/>
            here and till the fat glebes of Lemnos ? No fair fame shall <lb/>
            we win, I trow, from this our long sojourn with strange <lb/>
            women ; nor will some god of his own accord take the <lb/>
            . fleece and give it us at our prayer. Let us go each man to <lb/>
            his own again ; but leave ye that other to spend the live­ <lb/>
            long day in the arms of Hypsipyle, till he people Lemnos <lb/>
            with male children, and so there come to him great <lb/>

          <p>Thus did he chide the company, and none durst look <lb/>
            him in the face or make answer to him, but, even as they <lb/>
            were, hasting from the assembly they made ready to be <lb/>
            gone. But the women ran to them, when they learnt <lb/>
            thereof. And as when bees hum round fair lilies, pouring <lb/>
            forth from their hive in the rock, and around the dewy <lb/>
            meadow is glad, and they the while flit from flower to <lb/>
            flower, and gather their sweet food; even so, I ween, did <lb/>
            those women pour forth eagerly around the men, with loud <lb/>
            lament, while with hand and word they greeted each one, <lb/>
            praying to the blessed gods to grant them a safe return. <lb/>
            So too Hypsipyle prayed, taking the son of Æson by the <lb/>
            hands, and the tears that she' shed were for the loss of him <lb/>
            departing, " Go, and heaven guide thee hither again with <lb/>
            thy comrades all unmanned, bearing the golden fleece to <lb/>
            the king, even thus as thou wilt -and as is thy desire. <lb/>

            desire, and of myself I foresee that thus it will not come to <lb/>
            pass; still I pray thee, though thou art far away, and <lb/>

            me now thy bidding, which I will fulfil gladly, if, as may <lb/>

          <p>But the son of Æson, with a look of admiration answered <lb/>
            her : " Hypsipyle, may all these things turn out luckily by <lb/>
            the will of the blessed gods. But do thou devise some <lb/>
            better thought for me, for 'tis enough for me to dwell in <lb/>
            my fatherland by the grace of Pelias; only may heaven <lb/>
            loose me from my toils! But if it is not destined that I <lb/>
            should come to the land of Hellas after my far journey, <lb/>
            and thou do bear a boy, send him, when he is grown, <lb/>
            within Pelasgian Iolchos, to my father and mother, to <lb/>
            soothe their grief, if haply he find them yet alive, that they <lb/>
            may sit within their halls and be cared for, though I, the <lb/>
            king, be far away."</p>
          <p>Therewith he went aboard before them all, and in like <lb/>
            manner went the other chiefs, and, sitting in rows, they <lb/>
            grasped the oars in their hands, and Argus loosed for them <lb/>
            the stern-cables from beneath the sea-beat rock. Then did <lb/>
            they smite the water lustily with the long oars. At eve, by <lb/>
            the counsel of Orpheus, they beached the ship at the isle 1 of <lb/>
            Electra, daughter of Atlas, that they might learn the secret <lb/>
            rites through gentle initiation, and so might fare more <lb/>
            safely over the chilling sea. Of these things will I speak <lb/>
            no further; nay, farewell to yon isle itself, and farewell to <lb/>
            the gods who dwell there, whose mysteries these are ; of <lb/>
            them 'tis not right for us to sing.</p>
          <p>Hence did they row over the depths of the Black sea, <lb/>
            speeding on, with the land of Thrace on the one side, and <lb/>
            on the other side to starboard Imbros over against Thrace ; <lb/>
            and just at sunset they reached the promontory of Cher­ <lb/>
            .sonese. Then did the swift south-wind blow upon them ; <lb/>
            so they set the sails to the breeze and entered the rushing <note type="footnote"> 1 " The isle of Electra," i.e. Samothrace. Initiation into the sacred <lb/>

            stream 1 of the daughter of Athamas. At dawn the open <lb/>
            sea to the north was left behind, and at night were they <lb/>
            measuring their way over that which lies within the head­ <lb/>
            land of Rhceteum, keeping the land of Ida on the right. <lb/>
            Leaving Dardania they steered for Abydos, and on that <lb/>
            night passed by Percote and the sandy beach of Abarnis <lb/>
            and sacred Pityeia. Yea, on that night, as the ship sped <lb/>
            on with oar and sail,2 they passed right through the Helles­ <lb/>
            pont with its dark eddies.</p>
          <p>Now there is within Propontis a hilly isle,3 a little from <lb/>
            the Phrygian mainland with its rich corn-fields, sloping to <lb/>
            the sea, and there is an isthmus in front of the mainland <lb/>
            stretching across the sea, but the waves just wash over it. <lb/>
            And there are there two beaches, and they lie beyond the <lb/>
            waters of the Æsepus; and they who dwell around call the <lb/>
            hill Arctos. On it a wild and lawless race of earth-born <lb/>
            men ever had their home, a great wonder to their neigh­ <lb/>
            bours to behold; for each hath six masterful hands hang­ <lb/>
            ing from him, twain from his strong shoulders, and other <lb/>
            four joined below upon his fearsome sides. About the <lb/>
            isthmus and the plain the Doliones had their dwelling, and <lb/>
            amongst them Cyzicus, son of Æneus, held sway, whom <lb/>
            Ænete, daughter of divine Eusorus, bare. But these the <lb/>
            earth-born race in no wise harried, for all their fearsome­ <lb/>
            ness, for Poseidon guarded them; for from him were the <lb/>
            Doliones first sprung. Thither Argo pressed forward, <lb/>
            driven by the winds of Thrace, and a fair haven received <lb/>
            the speeding ship. There too by the advice of Tiphys they <lb/>
            loosed and left their light anchor-stone below a fountain, <lb/>
            even the Artacian fountain; and they chose another, which <lb/>
            suited them, a ponderous stone ; but that old one did the <note type="footnote"> 1 The Hellespont, so called from Helle, the daughter of Athamas. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 <foreign xml:lang="grc">διάνὂιχα</foreign> = in two ways, i.e. by oar and sail. </note><note type="footnote"> 3Cyzicus, afterwards mainland.

            Ionians,1 sons of Neleus, in the after time, in obedience to <lb/>
            the oracle of Hecatus, set up as holy, as was right, in the <lb/>
            temple of Athene, who was with Jason.</p>
          <p>Now the Doliones, yea, and Cyzicus himself, came forth <lb/>
            to meet them in a body, and treated them with kindness and <lb/>
            . hospitality, when they heard of their expedition and knew <lb/>
            their lineage, and who they were, and they persuaded them <lb/>
            to row on a space and moor the ship in the harbour of the <lb/>
            city. There they builded an altar to Apollo, god of em­ <lb/>
            barkation, and set it by the beach and busied themselves <lb/>
            with sacrifice. And the king of his own bounty gave them <lb/>
            in their need sweet mead and sheep as well; for lo! there <lb/>
            came a voice from heaven which said, that when there <lb/>
            -should arrive a goodly expedition of heroes, he should <lb/>
            straightway meet them graciously, and take no thought <lb/>
            for war. Now he was about Jason's age; his beard was <lb/>
            just sprouting, nor yet had he gotten children to his joy, <lb/>
            but his bride within his house had not yet known travail, <lb/>
            the daughter of Percosian Merops, Cleite with the fair <lb/>
            tresses, whom he had but lately brought thither from the <lb/>
            mainland opposite, with wondrous gifts of wooing to her <lb/>
            father. Yet even so he left his bridal bed and chamber, <lb/>
            and made ready a banquet amongst them,2 casting all fear <lb/>
            from his heart. And they questioned one another in turn; <lb/>
            -and he asked them of the end of their voyage and of the <lb/>
            commands of Pelias, while they enquired about the cities <lb/>
            of the folk around and about the whole gulf of wide <lb/>
            Propontis ; but he knew not how to tell them when they <lb/>
            were anxious to know aught far ahead. So at dawn they <lb/>
            went up to mighty Dindymus,3 that they might spy out <lb/>
            for themselves the passage of that sea, and they drave forth <note type="footnote">1 Ionian colonists led by Neleus, son of Codrus, from Attica. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 An oracle had warned king Cyzicus of the fate awaiting him at the <lb/>

            the ship from the outer basin of the harbour of Chytus; <lb/>
            wherefore this way they went is called Jason's way.</p>
          <p>But the earth-born men, rushing from both sides of the. <lb/>
            mountain, blocked the sea-ward mouth of boundless Chytus <lb/>
            with rocks at the bottom, lying in wait as though for a- <lb/>
            wild beast inside. Now Heracles had been left there with <lb/>
            the younger men; so quickly he stretched his curved bow <lb/>
            against them and brought them to the ground one after- <lb/>
            another; and they for their part caught up jagged rocks <lb/>
            and hurled them. For lo! Hera, goddess wife of Zeus,. <lb/>
            I wis, had raised those fearful monsters too, a labour for <lb/>
            Heracles ; and the other warlike heroes turned back anon <lb/>
            to meet them, or ever they had mounted to their place of <lb/>
            outlook, and joined in the slaughter of the earth-born men, <lb/>
            receiving them with arrows and swords till they had slain <lb/>
            them all as they rushed to meet them impetuously.</p>
          <p>As when wood-cutters throw down in rows upon the <lb/>
            beach long beams just hewn by their axes, that they <lb/>
            may soak and so receive the strong bolts; even so those- <lb/>
            monsters lay stretched there 1 in the entrance to the gray <lb/>
            haven, some with head and chest plunged all at once into <lb/>
            the salt water, and their limbs below spread out upon the <lb/>
            strand; others again were resting their heads upon the <lb/>
            sand of the beach and their feet in the deep water, both <lb/>
            alike to be a prey to birds and fishes.</p>
          <p>But the heroes, as soon as there was nought to fear for <lb/>
            their enterprise, at once loosed the cables of the ship to the <lb/>
            breath of the wind, and voyaged on across the ocean-swell. <lb/>
            And the ship sped on the live-long day under canvas; but, <lb/>
            as night came on, the rushing wind no longer abode stead­ <lb/>
            fast, but contrary blasts caught and swept them backward, <lb/>
            till they drew nigh again to the hospitable Doliones. And <lb/>
            they disembarked that self-same night; and that rock is: <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">ξυνόχη</foreign>, i.e. not merely the entrance to the harbour, but also all the­ <lb/>
            circumference of it. </note> <pb n="39"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="L. 986-1046.]"/><lb/>
            still called the sacred rock, whereto they bound the cables <lb/>
            of the ship in their haste. Nor did any man surely know <lb/>
            that it was really the island, nor did the Doliones by night <lb/>
            perceive for certain that it was the heroes again coining to <lb/>
            them ; but they supposed maybe some band of Pelasgian <lb/>
            warriors from the Macrians 1 was landing. Wherefore they <lb/>
            did on their harness and stretched forth their hands against <lb/>
            them. And they drove their ashen spears and shields <lb/>
            against each other, like a swift rush of fire, which falling <lb/>
            on a dry thicket rears its head; and withal upon the <lb/>
            Dolionian folk fell the din of battle, terrible and furious. <lb/>
            Nor was he, their king, to rise above the doom of battle <lb/>
            and come again home to his bridal chamber and bed. Nay, <lb/>
            him did the son of Æson, with one bound, smite through <lb/>
            the middle of the breast as he turned to face him, and the <lb/>
            bone splintered about his spear, and he grovelling on the <lb/>
            sand wound up his clew of fate. For mortal man may not <lb/>
            escape his fate, but on all sides is spread a mighty snare <lb/>
            around him. Thus upon that night it caught him in its <lb/>
            toils, as he thought, maybe, to avoid the bitter doom dealt <lb/>
            out by the chieftains, what time he fought with them ; and <lb/>
            many other champions were slain. Heracles slew Telecles <lb/>
            and Megabrontes; and Acastus stript Sphodris of his arms ; <lb/>
            and Peleus laid Zelys low, and Gephyrus, that fleet warrior. <lb/>
            And Telamon of the stout ashen spear killed Basileus. <lb/>
            Idas slew Promeus, and Clytius Hyacinthus ; and the two <lb/>
            sons of Tyndarus slew Megalossaces and Phlogius.</p>
          <p>Besides these the son of Œneus smote bold Itymoneus, <lb/>
            yea, and Artaces, a leader of men ; all these do the inhabi­ <lb/>
            tants still honour with the worship due to heroes.</p>
          <p>But the rest gave way and fled in terror, even as doves <note type="footnote"> 1 The Macrians or Macrones were colonists from Eubcea, and neigh­ <lb/>

            in flocks fly cowering from swift hawks, and they rushed <lb/>
            headlong to the gates with loud cries ; then straight was <lb/>
            the city filled with cries and groans as the battle was <lb/>
            turned backward. But at daybreak did both sides per­ <lb/>
            ceive their grievous, cureless error; and bitter anguish <lb/>
            seized the Minyan heroes when they saw before them <lb/>
            Cyzicus fallen mid the dust and blood. Three whole days <lb/>
            they mourned, they and the folk of the Doliones together, <lb/>
            tearing out their hair. And then thrice about his tomb <lb/>
            they marched in their bronze harness and made his funeral, <lb/>
            and instituted trial of games, as was right, on the meadow <lb/>
            plain, where to this day is his tomb heaped up for men <lb/>
            that shall be hereafter to see.</p>
          <p>Nor could his bride Cleite survive her husband's death, <lb/>
            but in her grief she wrought a deed more awful still, what <lb/>
            time she fastened the noose about her neck. And the <lb/>
            wood nymphs mourned her death, and all the tears they <lb/>
            let fall to earth from their eyes for her, of these did the <lb/>
            goddesses make a spring, which men call Cleite, the storied <lb/>
            name of that poor maid. Yea, that was the direst day <lb/>
            that Zeus ever sent upon the men and women of the <lb/>
            Doliones; for none of them could bear to taste of food, and <lb/>
            for a long time after their trouble they minded them not of <lb/>
            the work of grinding; but they dragged on their life, eating <lb/>
            the food, as it was, uncooked. There to this day, whenso <lb/>
            the Ionians, that dwell in Cyzicus, pour the yearly libation <lb/>
            to the dead, they ever grind their meal1 at the public mill.</p>
          <p>From thenceforth for twelve whole days and nights <lb/>
            arose tempestuous winds, which kept them there from <lb/>
            their voyage. But on the next night, all the other chiefs, <lb/>
            ere this, I ween, o'ercome by sleep, were resting there for <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">πέλανοι</foreign>, literally any half-liquid mixture of various consistency. Not <lb/>
            unfrequently a mixture of meal, honey, and oil offered to the gods, such <lb/>

            the last time, while Acastus and Mopsus, son of Ampycus, <lb/>
            guarded their sound slumbers. When lo! above the <lb/>
            yellow head of the son of Æson there flew a king-fisher, <lb/>
            boding by her shrill note an end of the violent winds; and <lb/>
            Mopsus, directly he heard the lucky cry of that bird of the <lb/>
            shore, marked it well; and the goddess brought it back <lb/>
            again, and it darted aloft and perched above the carved <lb/>
            stern ; then did Mopsus stir Jason, where he lay upon the <lb/>
            soft fleeces of sheep, and roused him instantly, and thus <lb/>
            unto him spake: " Son of Æson, to yonder temple on <lb/>
            rugged Dindymus thou must go up and seek the favour <lb/>
            of the fair-throned queen,1 mother of all the blessed gods ; <lb/>
            then shall cease the stormy winds. For such was the <lb/>
            voice I heard but now of the halcyon, bird of the sea, which <lb/>
            flew above about thy sleeping form and told me all. For <lb/>
            this goddess hath experience of the winds and the sea and <lb/>
            all the earth beneath and the snow-capped seat of Olym­ <lb/>
            pus ; and before her Zeus himself, the son of Cronos, doth <lb/>
            somewhat yield, when from her mountains she ascendeth <lb/>
            to the wide heaven. And hence it is the other blessed <lb/>
            deathless gods do reverence to this dread goddess."</p>
          <p>So spake he, and welcome to Jason's ear was his word. <lb/>
            And he roused him from his bed with joy, and hasted to <lb/>
            awake all his crew; and, when they were risen, he declared <lb/>
            to them the heavenly message of Mopsus, son of Ampycus. <lb/>
            Then straight did the young men drive up oxen from the <lb/>
            byres there to the steep mountain-top. And the rest <lb/>
            meantime loosed the cables from the sacred rock and rowed <lb/>
            to the Thracian2 harbour, and themselves went forth, leav­ <lb/>
            ing but a few of their fellows in the ship. Now upon their <note type="footnote"> 1 Rhea was called the mother of all the gods. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 i.e. the harbour of Cyzicus, which is here called Thracian because the <lb/>

            right hand the Macrian cliffs and all the Thracian main­ <lb/>
            land rose clear in view, and the dim entrance to the Bos­ <lb/>
            porus 1 and the hills of Mysia appeared; while upon their <lb/>
            left was the stream of the river Æsepus, and the city and <lb/>
            plain of Nepeia, which is called Adresteia. Now there was <lb/>
            a sturdy stump of a vine growing in a wood, an exceeding <lb/>
            old tree; this they cut out, for to make a sacred image of <lb/>
            the mountain goddess, and Argus polished it neatly, and <lb/>
            there upon that rugged hill they set it up beneath a canopy <lb/>
            of towering oaks, trees that have their roots deepest of all, <lb/>
            I trow. Next heaped they an altar of stones, and wreathed <lb/>
            it with oak-leaves, and busied themselves with sacrifice, <lb/>
            calling on the name of the Dindymian mother, queen re­ <lb/>

            dering through the air, even the lamentation, which the <lb/>
            folk were still raising at the funeral of their king. Whence <lb/>
            the Phrygians do ever seek the favour of Rhea with tam­ <lb/>
            bourine and drum. And now, I ween, the goddess turned <lb/>
            her ear to hearken to their pious worship ; and signs, that <lb/>
            are favourable, did appear. Trees shook down countless <lb/>
            fruits, and around their feet the earth of herself brought <lb/>
            forth the flowers of tender plants. Wild creatures left <lb/>
            their lairs in the thickets and came wagging their tails. <lb/>
            And yet another marvel she produced ; for aforetime Din­ <lb/>
            dymus had no running water, but now they saw it gush <lb/>
            forth there and cease not from the thirsty hill; wherefore <lb/>
            neighbouring folk in after time called that water Jason's <lb/>
            spring. Then did they make a feast in honour of the god­ <lb/>
            dess on Mount Arctos, singing the praise of Rhea, august <lb/>
            queen; and at dawn the wind ceased and they rowed away <lb/>
            from the island.</p>
          <p>Then rivalry stirred each chieftain's heart to be the last <lb/>
            to leave his rowing. For around them the still air had <lb/>
            laid the tumbling waves and lulled the sea to rest. So they, <lb/>
            trusting to the calm, drave on the ship mightily, nor would <lb/>
            even Poseidon's steeds, that are swift as wind, have caught <lb/>
            her as she sped through the sea. Yet as the salt waves <lb/>
            began to rise beneath violent gusts, which toward evening <lb/>
            were just beginning to get up from the rivers, then were <lb/>
            they for ceasing, foredone with toil; but Heracles with <lb/>
            mighty hands pulled those tired rowers along all together, <lb/>
            making the joints of the ship's timbers to quiver.</p>
          <p>But when, in their haste past the mainland of the <lb/>
            Mysians, they had sighted and sailed by the mouth of the <lb/>
            river Rhyndacus1 and the great cairn of Ægæon, a little <lb/>
            away from Phrygia; in that hour did Heracles break his <note type="footnote"> 1 A river of Phrygia. </note> <lb/>

            oar in the middle as he heaved aside the furrows of the <lb/>
            roughened surge. And backward fell he, grasping in both <lb/>
            hands one fragment, while the sea swept the other away on <lb/>
            its wash. And there he sat glaring round in silence, for <lb/>
            his hands knew not to be idle.</p>
          <p>At the hour when some delver or ploughman cometh <lb/>
            from the field joyfully to his cottage, longing for his supper; <lb/>
            and there on his threshold, all squalid with dust as he is, <lb/>
            lie droops his weary knees, and, gazing on his toil-worn <lb/>
            hands, many a bitter curse he flingeth at that belly of his ; <lb/>
            in that hour, I trow, came those heroes to the abodes of <lb/>
            the land Cianian about the Arganthonian mountain and the <lb/>
            mouth of the river Cios. And the Mysians welcomed them <lb/>
            with all hospitality and kindness on their coming, for they <lb/>
            &gt; dwelt in that land, and they gave them at their need Sheep <lb/>
            and mead in plenty. So then some brought dry logs, and <lb/>
            others mowed the plenteous herbage of the meadows for <lb/>
            beds to strew withal, and others twirled sticks to get fire; <lb/>
            and they mixed wine in bowls, and made ready a feast, <lb/>
            after sacrificing to Apollo, god of embarkation, as darkness <lb/>
            fell.</p>
          <p>Now Heracles bade his comrades give good heed unto <lb/>
            the feast, while he went on his way to the wood, that son <lb/>
            of Zeus, that he might first fashion for himself an oar to <lb/>
            suit him. And in his wandering he found a pine that was <lb/>
            not burdened with many branches, nor had much foliage <lb/>
            thereon, but it was like some tall poplar sapling to look at <lb/>
            both in height and girth. Quickly then upon the ground <lb/>
            he laid his quiver, arrows and all, and doffed his lion-skin. <lb/>
            And when he with his heavy club of bronze had made it <lb/>
            totter from its base, then did he grip it low down about the <lb/>
            stump with both hands, trusting to his strength, and plant­ <lb/>
            ing himself firmly he leant his broad shoulder against it, <lb/>
            and so clinging to it he dragged it from the ground, deep­ <lb/>
            rooted though it was, clods of earth and all. As when a <pb n="45"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="L. 1168-1233.]"/> <lb/>
            sudden squall of wind strikes aloft a ship's mast unex­ <lb/>
            pectedly, just at the time of baleful Orion's winter setting, <lb/>
            and tears it from its stays,1 wedges and all; even thus the <lb/>
            strong man dragged it out. And at once he caught up his <lb/>
            bow and arrows, and his skin and club, and hasted to go <lb/>
            back.</p>
          <p>Meantime Hylas with a brazen pitcher went apart from <lb/>
            the company, in quest of a sacred running spring, that he <lb/>
            might ere his return draw for him water against supper­ <lb/>
            time, and get all else ready and in order for him at his <lb/>
            coming. For Heracles had with his own hands brought <lb/>
            him up in such habits from his earliest childhood, having <lb/>
            robbed him from his father's house, goodly Theiodamas, <lb/>
            whom he slew ruthlessly amongst the Dryopes, because he <lb/>
            withstood him about a steer for ploughing. Now Theio­ <lb/>
            damas was ploughing up a fallow field, when the curse fell <lb/>
            on him; and Heracles bade him give up the steer he was <lb/>
            ploughing with, and he would not. For he longed to find <lb/>
            some grim pretext for war against the Dryopes, for there <lb/>
            they dwelt without regard for justice. But this would <lb/>
            send me straying far from my story. Quickly came Hylas. <lb/>
            to the spring, which they who dwell around and near call <lb/>
            Pegæ. Now it chanced that lately choirs of nymphs had <lb/>
            settled there ; their care it was ever to hymn Artemis with <lb/>
            midnight song, as many of them as dwelt there round the <lb/>
            lovely peak. All those, whose lot it is to watch o'er hill- <lb/>
            tops and mountain-streams, and they who guard the woods, <lb/>
            were all drawn up apart; but she, the nymph of the water, <lb/>
            was just rising from her lovely spring, when she marked <lb/>
            him near with the blush of his beauty and sweet grace <lb/>
            upon him. For on him the full moon from heaven was <lb/>
            shedding her light. And Cypris made the nymph's heart. <lb/>
            flutter, and scarce in her confusion could she collect her- <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">σφήνεσσιν</foreign>, wedges to block the mast firmly in its hole. <foreign xml:lang="grc">προτόνων</foreign>, <lb/>
            stays from the top of the mast to the deck to keep it still firmer. </note> <pb n="46"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BOOK I."/><lb/>
            self. But he, so soon as lie had dipped his pitcher in the <lb/>
            stream, leaning aslant over it, and good store of water was <lb/>
            flowing into the sounding brass and bubbling round it, lo! <lb/>
            in that instant the nymph from below the water laid her <lb/>
            left arm on his neck, longing to kiss his soft lips; while <lb/>
            with her right hand she plucked him by the elbow and <lb/>
            plunged him amid the ripple.</p>
          <p>And as he cried out, Polyphemus, son of Elatus, alone <lb/>
            of his comrades, heard him, as he came on along the path. <lb/>
            For he would welcome mighty Heracles, whensoever he <lb/>
            might come. Away rushed he towards Pegæ like some <lb/>
            wild beast, to whom from afar hath come the bleating of <lb/>
            sheep, and furious with hunger he goeth to find them and <lb/>
            yet cometh not upon the flocks, for shepherds before have <lb/>
            penned them with their own hands within the fold; but <lb/>
            he howls and roars unceasingly till he is tired. So then <lb/>
            did the son of Elatus cry aloud, and went to and fro about <lb/>
            the place shouting, and piteous was his voice. Anon drew <lb/>
            lie his mighty sword and started to go forth, for fear that <lb/>
            the boy might be a prey to beasts, or men have taken him <lb/>
            in ambush as he was alone, and be leading him away, an <lb/>
            easy booty. Then did he meet Heracles himself in the <lb/>
            way, as he was brandishing his naked sword in his hand, <lb/>
            and right well he knew him as he hasted toward the ship <lb/>
            through the darkness. At once he told the grievous news, <lb/>
            gasping hard for breath, " God help thee! friend, a bitter <lb/>
            grief shall I be the first to tell thee. Hylas went unto the <lb/>
            spring, but he cometh not again in safety; but robbers <lb/>
            have attacked him and are leading him away, or beasts are <lb/>
            tearing him, for I heard his loud cry."</p>
          <p>So spake he; and, as the other listened, there broke out <lb/>
            great beads of sweat upon his forehead, and beneath his <lb/>
            heart the dark blood surged. Down upon the ground in <lb/>
            wrath he cast the pine, and hasted along the path whither <lb/>
            his feet carried him in his hurry. As when a bull some­ <pb n="47"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="L. 1234-1292.]"/><lb/>
            where, stung by the gadfly, rushes along, leaving the <lb/>
            meadows and marsh-lands, and heedeth not the herdsmen, <lb/>
            nor the herd, but passes on his way, at one time without <lb/>
            stopping, and again standing still, and lifting up his broad <lb/>
            neck he bellows aloud, 'neath the sting of that cursed <lb/>
            fly ; even so Heracles in his eagerness now made his swift <lb/>
            knees move without a check, and now again, ceasing from <lb/>
            his toil, he would make his loud shout peal afar.</p>
          <p>Anon uprose the morning star above the topmost heights, <lb/>
            and down came the breeze; quickly then did Tiphys urge <lb/>
            them go aboard and take advantage of the wind. So they <lb/>
            at once embarked eagerly, and they hauled in the anchor- <lb/>
            ropes of the ship and backed her out.1 And the sails were <lb/>
            bellied out by the wind, and they were borne far from the <lb/>
            beach past the headland of Posideum, glad at heart. Now <lb/>
            when bright-eyed dawn, arising from the east, shed its <lb/>
            light from heaven, and the paths stood out clearly, and <lb/>
            the dew-spangled plains shone in the bright gleam, then <lb/>
            knew they those whom they had left behind in ignorance. <lb/>
            And there arose a fierce strife amongst them, and brawl­ <lb/>
            ing unspeakable, to think that they had gone and left the <lb/>
            best of all their crew. But he, the son of Æson, mazed <lb/>
            and at a loss, had nought to say one way or the other, but <lb/>
            there he sat, inly consuming his soul with heavy woe ; but <lb/>
            Telamon2 was seized with wrath and thus spake he, " Sit <lb/>
            thee then in silence thus, since it pleased thee well to leave <lb/>
            Heracles behind; far from thee is any counsel, that so his <lb/>
            fame may not o'ershadow thee in Hellas,3 if haply the gods <note type="footnote"> 1 The ancient mode of landing was to beach the ship, if possible, and <lb/>
            then fasten by cables to the land, and by anchors from the stern in the <lb/>

            stones, and then back the ship out. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Telamon had joined Heracles in his expedition against the Amazons, <lb/>

            words ? for I will go even apart from thy crew, who helped <lb/>
            thee to devise this guile."</p>
          <p>He spake, and sprung toward Tiphys, son of Hagnias, <lb/>
            and his two eyes were like the flash of glowing fire. And <lb/>
            now would they have come back to the Mysian land in <lb/>
            spite of the wide sea and the ceaseless roaring blast, had <lb/>
            not the two sons of Thracian Boreas held back the SOIl of <lb/>
            Æacus with harsh words, poor wights ; 1 verily upon them <lb/>
            came a grievous vengeance in the aftertime from the hands <lb/>
            of Heracles, for that they stayed the search for him. For <lb/>
            he slew them in sea-girt Tenos as they returned from the <lb/>
            games after the slaughter of Pelias, and he piled the earth <lb/>
            about them, and set up two pillars above them, whereof <lb/>
            the one, an exceeding marvel for men to see, is stirred by <lb/>
            the breath of the noisy north-wind. Thus were these <lb/>
            things to be brought to pass in days to come. But to them <lb/>
            appeared Glaucus2 from the depth of the sea, wise ex­ <lb/>
            pounder of the will of godlike Nereus ; and he raised aloft <lb/>
            his shaggy head and chest from the hollow depths, and <lb/>
            laid hold upon the ship's keel with his stalwart hand and <lb/>
            cried to them as they hastened, " Why against the will of <lb/>
            mighty Zeus are ye eager to take bold Heracles to the <lb/>
            city of Æetes ? His lot it is to toil in Argos for insolent <note type="footnote"> the poet's treatment of Jason's character ; not enough prominence is <lb/>

          <p>Therewith he dived below and wrapped the restless <lb/>
            wave around him, and the dark water seethed and foamed <lb/>
            in eddies about him, and he let the hollow ship go on <lb/>
            through the sea. Then were the heroes glad; and he, <lb/>
            Telamon, son of Æacus, made haste to come to Jason, and <lb/>
            he grasped his hand in his own and embraced him, with <lb/>
            these words, " Son of Æson, be not angered with me, if in <lb/>
            my folly I was somewhat blinded, for exceeding grief <lb/>
            urged me to speak a haughty word I could not stay. Nay, <lb/>
            let us give our error to the winds, and be good friends even <lb/>
            as before."</p>
          <p>Him in answer the son of Æson cautiously addressed, <lb/>
            "Yea, good friend, that was a grievous word enough, I <lb/>
            trow, wherewith thou didst revile me, making me to be a <lb/>
            sinner against a comrade kind amongst all these. Yet no <lb/>
            long time will I nurse bitter wrath against thee, though <lb/>
            before distressed, for it was not for flocks of sheep nor <lb/>
            for possessions that thou wert angered into fury, but for a <lb/>

          <p>He spake, and they sat them down, united as of old; <lb/>
            and so by the counsel of Zeus, the one was destined to <lb/>

            But they chose out the noblest sons of the people, and <lb/>

            would never cease from the toil of seeking him. Where­ <lb/>

          <p>And all day long and all that night the wind bare on <lb/>
            the ship, blowing in its strength ; but as the dawn broke, <lb/>
            never a breath stirred. So they, having marked a head­ <lb/>
            land, broad enow to look upon, stretching out from a bend <lb/>

          <p>They reach Bithynia. Amycus, king of the Bebryces, having chal­ <lb/>
            lenged any of them to box with him, is slain by Polydeuces, and in the <lb/>
            subsequent fight many of the Bebryces fall. At Salmydessa in Thrace <lb/>
            they find blind Phineus, whom the sons of Boreas relieve from the <lb/>
            attacks of the Harpies. In return he tells them of their voyage. Hence <lb/>
            they come to the Symplegades, and, after escaping through them, are <lb/>
            received by Lycus, king of the Mariandyni. Idmon and Tiphys die <lb/>
            there. They meet with strange adventures among the Chalybes, Tiba­ <lb/>
            reni, and Mossynœci. Coming to an island infested by " the birds of <lb/>
            Ares," they pick up the shipwrecked sons of Chalciope, who henceforth <lb/>
            serve them as guides to Colchis.</p><pb n="53"/>

          <p>H <lb/>
            ERE were the steadings and the farm of Amycus, <lb/>
            proud king of the Bebryces, whom on a day the <lb/>
            Bithynian nymph, Melie, bare from the embraces of Posei­ <lb/>
            don,1 lord of birth, to be the haughtiest of men, for he laid <lb/>
            this unseemly ordinance even on his guests, that none <lb/>
            should go away, till he had made trial of his boxing; and <lb/>
            many of his neighbours had he slain. So then he came to <lb/>
            the ship, but scorned to ask the object of their voyage and <lb/>
            who they were, in his exceeding insolence; but this word <lb/>
            at once spake he amongst them all: " Hearken, ye rovers <lb/>
            o'er the deep; 'tis right ye should know these things. Of <lb/>
            stranger folk none may get him hence, whoso draweth nigh <lb/>
            to the Bebryces, ere he have lifted up his hands to fight <lb/>
            with me. Wherefore set the best man of your company <lb/>
            alone and apart to do battle with me in boxing on the spot. <lb/>
            But if ye neglect and trample on my decrees, verily some <lb/>
            hard necessity shall follow you to your sorrow."</p>
          <p>So spake he in his great pride. But savage anger seized <lb/>
            them as they listened. And most of all his chiding smote <lb/>
            Polydeuces. Quickly he stood up as champion of his fel­ <lb/>
            lows, and spake, "Hold thee now, and show no coward <lb/>
            violence, whoever thou boastest to be ; for we will yield to <lb/>
            thy ordinance, as thou declarest it. I myself willingly do <lb/>
            undertake to meet thee in this very hour." <note type="footnote"> 1 Poseidon is called " Lord of Creation " because he had power over <lb/>
            all moisture, without which nothing could come into being. </note> <pb n="54"/>
            </p>
          <p><note type="correspondsTo" n="[BOOK II."/>So spake he bluntly; but the other rolled his eyes and <lb/>
            gazed at him, as when a lion is wounded by a spear, and <lb/>
            men encompass him upon the hills ; but he, hemmed in, <lb/>
            though he be, by the press, yet recketh no more of them, <lb/>
            but only mindeth in his solitude that man who first did <lb/>
            wound him and slew him not. Then did the son of Tyn­ <lb/>
            darus lay aside his fine close-woven robe, that robe which <lb/>
            one of the Lemnian maidens had given him for a stranger's <lb/>
            gift, and he threw down his dark cloak of double woof with <lb/>
            the brooches thereupon, and the rough shepherd's crook of <lb/>
            wild mountain olive that he was carrying. Anon they <lb/>
            looked about for a convenient spot near, and made their <lb/>
            comrades all sit down in two bands upon the beach; nor <lb/>
            were they in form or stature like each other to behold. The <lb/>
            one was like some monstrous birth of baleful Typhoeus1 or <lb/>
            haply of Earth herself, such as she aforetime bare to Zeus <lb/>
            in her displeasure;' while the other, the son of Tyndarus, <lb/>
            was like a star of heaven, whose twinklings are most lovely <lb/>
            when he shineth in the gloaming. So fair was the son of <lb/>
            Zeus, with the young down still sprouting on his face and <lb/>
            the glad light yet in his eyes. But his might and his spirit <lb/>
            waxed as doth a beast's ; and he swung his arms, testing <lb/>
            them to see if they moved nimbly as of yore, or lest they <lb/>
            might be stiff withal from toil and rowing. Amycus how­ <lb/>
            ever made no trial of himself; there he stood apart in <lb/>
            silence, and kept his eyes on him, and his heart beat high <lb/>
            with eagerness to dash the other's life-blood from his breast. <lb/>
            Betwixt them Lycoreus, henchman of Amycus, laid at their <lb/>
            feet two pairs of thongs,' rough, dry, and wrinkled all about. <note type="footnote"> 1 Typhoeus, a fearful giant slain by Zeus, and buried by him in <lb/>

            <pb n="55"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="L. 25-84.]"/><lb/>
            And Amycus with haughty words addressed the other: <lb/>
            " Here will I freely give thee without casting lots which- <lb/>
            ever of these thou wilt, that thou mayst not find fault with <lb/>
            me hereafter. Come, bind it about thy hand; and, when <lb/>
            thou hast learnt, thou mayst tell another, how far I excel <lb/>
            in cutting the hides of oxen when they are dry, and in <lb/>
            dabbling men's cheeks with blood."</p>
          <p>He spake; but the other answered him with never a taunt, <lb/>
            but, lightly smiling, readily took up the thongs that lay at <lb/>
            his own feet; and Castor came to be his squire, and mighty <lb/>
            Talaus, the son of Bias ; and quickly they bound the thongs <lb/>
            about his arms, very earnestly exhorting him to show his <lb/>
            prowess ; while for that other Aretus and Ornytus did the <lb/>
            like, and little they knew, poor fools, that they had bound <lb/>
            them for the last time, with ill luck to boot.</p>
          <p>But they then, when they were ready with their thongs, <lb/>
            face to face, at once held out before their bodies their <lb/>
            weighty fists, and brought their might to meet each other. <lb/>
            Then the king of the Bebryces, like a wave of the sea that <lb/>
            rears its rugged crest against a swift ship that only just <lb/>
            avoids it by the skill of the crafty pilot, as the billow is <lb/>
            eager to sweep her away within its wall of water; even so <lb/>
            the king pressed hard the son of Tyndarus to frighten him, <lb/>
            nor would he give him any respite. But the other, un­ <lb/>
            wounded ever, kept avoiding his rush by his skill; and <lb/>
            quickly he noted his rough boxing, to see if he were invin­ <lb/>
            cible in his strength or haply his inferior; so there he stood <lb/>
            continually,1 and gave him blow for blow. As when car­ <lb/>
            penters, urgently laying on, do strike with hammers and <lb/>
            nail together ship-timbers with sharp mortices, while blow <lb/>
            on blow re-echoes round unceasingly ; so their cheeks and <lb/>
            jaws on both sides resounded, and the gnashing of teeth <lb/>
            arose incessantly, and they ceased not to smite each in turn, <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἃμοτον</foreign>. A word of uncertain derivation, frequently occurring in <lb/>
            Apollonius in the sense of " insatiably." </note> <pb n="56"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BOOK II."/><lb/>
            till sore gasping o'ercame them both. Then stood they a <lb/>
            little apart, wiping from their faces great drops of sweat, <lb/>
            with grievous panting and hard breathing the while. Once <lb/>
            more they roused them to the encounter, like two bulls that <lb/>
            furiously battle for a grazing heifer. Then did Amycus, <lb/>
            rising on tiptoe, like a butcher, strain to his full height and <lb/>
            shot forth his heavy fist at him, but he stooped his head <lb/>
            and went under his rush, but caught his blow just on the <lb/>
            shoulder; then did he come up to Amycus, and advancing <lb/>
            his knee past him dashed in and smote him above the ear, <lb/>
            crashing the bones inward ; and the other fell on his knees <lb/>
            in agony, but the Minyan heroes cheered ; and away sped <lb/>
            his spirit at once.</p>
          <p>But the Bebryces, I trow, left not their king thus ; no, <lb/>
            at once they caught up rough clubs and spears aud made <lb/>
            straight for Polydeuces. But his comrades drew their keen <lb/>
            swords from the scabbards and stood up before him. 'Twas <lb/>
            Castor first that smote a man upon the head as he rushed <lb/>
            at him, and his skull was cleft in twain on either shoulder. <lb/>
            Likewise he smote the giant Itymoneus and Mimas; the <lb/>
            one he smote beneath the breast, having rushed on him with <lb/>
            speedy foot,1 and hurled him in the dust; the other, as he <lb/>
            drew nigh, he struck with his right hand above the left <lb/>
            eye-brow and tore off the lid, and the eye was left uncovered. <lb/>
            And Oreides too, daring squire of Amycus, wounded Talaus, <lb/>
            the SOIl of Bias, in the loins, but he slew him not, for the <lb/>
            bronze sped beneath his belt merely along the skin, and <lb/>
            touched not his belly. In like manner Aretus sprang at <lb/>
            Iphitus, steadfast son of Eurytus, and smote him with a <lb/>
            seasoned club, not yet doomed to die miserably ; Aretus <lb/>
            indeed was soon to fall beneath the sword of Clytius.</p>
          <p>'Twas then that Ancaeus, bold son of Lycurgus, uplifted <lb/>
            his great axe right speedily, holding his black bear skin in <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">λάξ</foreign>, an adverb, = "with the heel or foot," on the same analogy as <lb/>

            his left hand, and sprang furiously into the thick of the <lb/>
            Bebryces, and the son of Æacus charged with him, and <lb/>
            Jason too rushed on with them.</p>
          <p>As when, on a day in winter, grizzled wolves attack and <lb/>
            terrify countless sheep in the fold without the knowledge <lb/>
            of the keen-scented dogs and the shepherds themselves, <lb/>
            and they seek how they may at once spring on them and <lb/>
            take them, oft peering over the pens withal, while the sheep <lb/>
            from every side huddle as they are, tumbling over one an­ <lb/>
            other ; even so, I ween, the heroes grievously affrighted <lb/>
            the overweening Bebryces. As shepherds or bee-keepers <lb/>
            smoke a mighty swarm of bees in a rock, and these the <lb/>
            while, all huddled in their hive, buzz round confusedly ; <lb/>
            and far from the rock they dart, smoked right through by <lb/>
            the sooty fumes; so these men no longer abode steadfastly, <lb/>
            but fled routed within Bebrycia, carrying the news of the <lb/>
            death of Amycus ; poor fools, for they knew not of another <lb/>
            unseen woe that was very nigh to them. For their orchards <lb/>
            and villages were wasted by the hostile spear of Lycus and <lb/>
            the Mariandyni, now that their king was gone. For there <lb/>
            was ever a feud twixt them about the land that yielded <lb/>
            iron; for these at once began to pillage the farms and <lb/>
            steadings, while the heroes forthwith plundered and <lb/>
            carried off their countless sheep ; and thus some man <lb/>
            amongst them would say : " Bethink you what they would <lb/>
            have brought upon themselves by their craven deeds, if <lb/>
            haply some god had brought Heracles too hither. Very sure <lb/>
            . am I, had he been here, there would have been not so much <lb/>
            as a trial of boxing ; no, but when he came to tell his ordi­ <lb/>
            nances, forthwith the club would have made him forget his <lb/>
            pride and the ordinances too which he declared. Yea, we <lb/>
            have left him yonder on the shore without a thought and <lb/>
            gone our way across the sea, but every man amongst us <lb/>
            shall know that fatal mistake, now that he is far away."</p>
          <p>Thus spake he; but all these things were wrought by <pb n="58"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BOOK II."/><lb/>
            the counsels of Zeus. There they abode that night, and <lb/>
            set to curing the wounds of those who were smitten, and <lb/>
            they offered sacrifices to the deathless gods, and made <lb/>
            ready a great supper; and sleep o'ertook no man beside <lb/>
            the wine-bowls and the blazing sacrifices. And they <lb/>
            wreathed their yellow locks with bay that groweth by the <lb/>
            sea, whereto also were fastened the cables, and sang in sweet <lb/>
            harmony to the lyre of Orpheus; and as they sang the <lb/>
            headland round grew calm and still, for their song was of <lb/>
            the son of Zeus,' who dwelleth in Therapnæ.</p>
          <p>Now when the sun, rising from the east, shone upon the <lb/>
            dewy hills, and awoke shepherds, in that hour they loosed <lb/>
            their cables from the stem of the bay-tree, and, putting <lb/>
            their booty on board, even all that they had need to carry, <lb/>
            they steered with the wind along the swirling Bosporus. <lb/>
            Then did a wave like to a steep mountain rush upon them <lb/>
            in front, as though it were charging them, rearing itself <lb/>
            ever above the clouds, and never wouldst thou have said <lb/>
            they would escape a horrid fate, for it hung arching right <lb/>
            over the middle of the ship in all its fury; but yet even <lb/>
            this grows smooth, if but you possess a clever pilot. So <lb/>
            then they too came forth, unscathed, though much afeard, <lb/>
            through the skill of Tiphys. And on the next day they <lb/>
            anchored over against the Bithynian land.</p>
          <p>Here Phineus, son of . Agenor, had his home beside the <lb/>
            sea; he who, by reason of the divination that the son of <lb/>
            Leto granted him aforetime, suffered most awful woes, far <lb/>
            beyond all men; for not one jot did he regard even Zeus <lb/>
            himself, in foretelling the sacred purpose to men unerringly. <lb/>
            Wherefore Zeus granted him a weary length of days, but <lb/>
            reft his eyes of the sweet light, nor suffered him to have <lb/>
            any joy of all the countless gifts, which those, who dwelt <lb/>
            around and sought to him for oracles, were ever bringing to <note type="footnote"> 1 " The Therapnaean son of Zeus," i.e. Apollo, so called from <lb/>
            Therapnæ, a part of Sparta, which was sacred to this god. </note> <pb n="59"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="L. 155-220.]"/><lb/>
            his house. But suddenly through the clouds the Harpies <lb/>
            darted nigh, and kept snatching them from his mouth or <lb/>
            hands in their talons. Sometimes never a morsel of food <lb/>
            was left him, sometimes a scrap, that he might live and <lb/>
            suffer. And upon his food they spread a fetid stench; <lb/>
            and none could endure to bring food to his mouth, but <lb/>
            stood afar off; so foul a reek breathed from the remnants <lb/>
            of his meal. At once, when he heard the sound and noise <lb/>
            of a company, he perceived that they were the very men <lb/>
            now passing by, at whose coming an oracle from Zeus had <lb/>
            said that he should enjoy his food. Up from his couch he <lb/>
            rose, as it were, a lifeless phantom, and, leaning on his <lb/>
            staff, came to the door on his wrinkled feet, feeling his <lb/>
            way along the walls ; and, as he went, his limbs trembled <lb/>
            from weakness and age, and his skin was dry and caked <lb/>
            with filth, and nought but the skin held his bones together. <lb/>
            So he came forth from his hall, and sat down with heavy <lb/>
            knees on the threshold of the court, and a dark mantle <lb/>
            wrapped him, and seemed to sweep the ground below all <lb/>
            round ; and there he sank with never a word, in strength­ <lb/>
            less lethargy.</p>
          <p>But they, when they saw him, gathered round, and were <lb/>
            astonied. And he, drawing a laboured breath from the <lb/>
            bottom of his chest, took up his parable for them and said: <lb/>
            " Hearken, choice sons of all the Hellenes, if 'tis you in <lb/>
            very truth, whom now Jason, at the king's chill bidding, is <lb/>
            leading on the ship Argo to fetch the fleece. 'Tis surely <lb/>
            you. Still doth my mind know each thing by its divining. <lb/>
            Wherefore to thee, my prince, thou son of Leto, do I give <lb/>
            thanks eyen in my cruel sufferings. By Zeus, the god of <lb/>
            suppliants, most awful god to sinful men, for Phœbus’ sake <lb/>
            and for the sake of Hera herself, who before all other gods <lb/>
            hath had you in her keeping as ye came, help me, I im­ <lb/>
            plore ; rescue a hapless wretch from misery, and do not <lb/>
            heedlessly go hence and leave me thus. For not only hath <pb n="60"/>

            the avenging fiend set his heel upon my eyes, not only do I <lb/>
            drag out to the end a tedious old age, but yet another most <lb/>
            bitter pain is added to the tale. Harpies, swooping from <lb/>
            some unseen den of destruction, that I see not, do snatch the <lb/>
            food from my mouth. And I have no plan to help me. But <lb/>
            lightly would my mind forget her longing for a meal, or <lb/>
            the thought of them, so quickly fly they through the air. <lb/>
            But if, as happens at times, they leave me some scrap of <lb/>
            food, a noisome stench it bath, and a smell too strong to <lb/>
            bear, nor could any mortal man draw nigh and bear it even <lb/>
            for a little while, no, not though his heart were forged of <lb/>
            adamant. But me, God wot, doth necessity, cruel and in­ <lb/>
            satiate, constrain to abide, and abiding to put such food in <lb/>
            my miserable belly. Them 'tis heaven's decree that the <lb/>
            sons of Boreas 1 shall check; and they shall ward them off, <lb/>
            for they are my kinsmen, if indeed I am that Phineus, who <lb/>
            in days gone by had a name amongst men for my wealth <lb/>
            and divination, whom Agenor, my sire, begat; their sister <lb/>
            Cleopatra2 did I bring to my house as wife with gifts of <lb/>
            wooing, what time I ruled among the Thracians."</p>
          <p>So spake the son of Agenor; and deep sorrow took hold <lb/>
            on each of the heroes, but specially on the two sons of <lb/>
            Boreas. But they wiped away a tear and drew nigh, and <lb/>
            thus spake Zetes, taking in his the hand of the suffering <lb/>
            old man: " Ah! poor sufferer, methinks there is no other <lb/>
            man more wretched than thee. Why is it that such woes <lb/>
            have fastened on thee ? Is it that thou hast sinned against <lb/>
            the gods in deadly folly through thy skill in divination ? <lb/>
            Wherefore are they so greatly wroth against thee ? Lo ! <lb/>
            our heart within us is sorely bewildered, though.we yearn <lb/>
            to help thee, if in very truth the god hath reserved for us <note type="footnote"> 1 The sons of Boreas were Zetes and Calais. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Phineus in his happier days had married Cleopatra, daughter of <lb/>

            twain this honour. For plain to see are the rebukes that <lb/>
            the immortals send on us men of earth. Nor will we check <lb/>
            the coming of the Harpies, for all our eagerness, till that <lb/>
            thou swear that we shall not fall from heaven's favour in <lb/>
            return for this." So spake he, and straight that aged man <lb/>
            opened his sightless eyes and lifted them up, and thus <lb/>
            made answer: " Hush ! remind me not of those things, my <lb/>
            son. The son of Leto be my witness, who of his kindness <lb/>
            taught me divination ; be witness that ill-omened fate, that <lb/>
            is my lot, and this dark cloud upon my eyes, and the gods <lb/>
            below, whose favour may I never find if I die perjured <lb/>
            thus, that there shall come no wrath from heaven on you <lb/>
            by reason of your aid."</p>
          <p>Then were those twain eager to help him by reason of <lb/>
            the oath, and quickly did the young men make ready a <lb/>
            feast for the old man, a last booty for the Harpies ; and <lb/>
            the two stood near to strike them with their swords as they <lb/>
            swooped down. Soon as ever that aged man did touch the <lb/>
            food, down rushed those Harpies with whirr of wings at <lb/>
            once, eager for the food, like grievous blasts, or like <lb/>
            lightning darting suddenly from the clouds; but those <lb/>
            heroes, when they saw them in mid air, shouted ; and they <lb/>
            at the noise sped off afar across the sea after they had <lb/>
            devoured everything, but behind them was left an intoler­ <lb/>
            able stench. And the two sons of Boreas started in pur­ <lb/>
            suit of them with their swords drawn; for Zeus inspired <lb/>
            them with tireless courage, and 'twas not without the will <lb/>
            of Zeus that they followed them, for they would dart past <lb/>
            the breath of the west wind, what time they went to and <lb/>
            from Phineus. As when upon the hill-tops dogs skilled <lb/>
            in the chase run on the track of homed goats or deer, and, <lb/>
            straining at full speed just behind, in vain do gnash their <lb/>
            teeth upon their lips; even so Zetes and Calais, darting <lb/>
            very nigh to them, in vain grazed them with their finger­ <lb/>
            tips. And now, I trow, they would have torn them in <pb n="62"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BOOK II."/><lb/>
            pieces against the will of the gods on the floating islands,' <lb/>
            after they had come afar, had not swift Iris seen them, <lb/>
            and darting down from the clear heaven above stayed them <lb/>
            with this word of rebuke: " Ye sons of Boreas, 'tis not or­ <lb/>
            dained that ye should slay the Harpies, the hounds of <lb/>
            mighty Zeus, with your swords; but I, even I, will give <lb/>
            you an oath that they will come no more nigh him."</p>
          <p>Therewith she sware by the stream of Styx, most dire <lb/>
            and awful oath for all the gods, that these should never <lb/>
            again draw near unto the house of Phineus, son of Agenor, <lb/>
            for even so was it fated. So they yielded to her oath and <lb/>
            turned to hasten back to the ship. And so it is that men <lb/>
            call those isles, " the isles of turning," though aforetime <lb/>
            they called them " the floating isles." And the Harpies <lb/>
            and Iris parted; they entered their lair in Crete, the land <lb/>
            of Minos, but she sped up to Olympus, soaring on her <lb/>
            swift pinions.</p>
          <p>Meantime the chieftains carefully washed the old man's <lb/>
            squalid skin, and chose out and sacrificed sheep, which <lb/>
            they had brought from the booty of Amycus. Now when <lb/>
            they had laid a great supper in his halls, they sat them <lb/>
            down and feasted, and with them Phineus fell afeasting <lb/>
            ravenously, cheering his heart as in a dream. Then when <lb/>
            they had taken their fill of food and drink, they sat up all <lb/>
            night awaiting the sons of Boreas. And in their midst <lb/>
            beside the hearth sat that ancient one himself, telling <lb/>
            them of the ends of their voyage and the fulfilment of <lb/>
            their journey: " Hearken then. All ye may not learn of a <lb/>
            surety, but as much as is heaven's will I will not hide. <lb/>
            Aforetime I went astray in my folly by declaring the mind <lb/>
            of Zeus in order to the end. For he willeth himself to <lb/>
            make plain to men oracles that need divination, to the <note type="footnote"> 1 " The Floating Isles " in the Sicilian sea. They were supposed to <lb/>
            be capable of movement. After the flight of the Harpies here, they were <lb/>
            called the Strophades, i.e. " Isles of turning." </note> <pb n="63"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="L. 285-345.]"/><lb/>
            end that they may have some need of the mind of the <lb/>
            gods.</p>
          <p>" First of all, when ye have gone hence from me, ye shall <lb/>
            see the two Cyanean1 rocks at the place where two seas <lb/>
            meet. Through these, I trow, none can win a passage. <lb/>
            For they are not fixed on foundations below, but oft they <lb/>
            clash together upon each other, and much salt water boils <lb/>
            up from beneath, rearing its crest, and loud is the roar <lb/>
            round the bluff headland.</p>
          <p>" Wherefore now give heed to my exhorting, if in sooth ye <lb/>
            make this voyage with cautious mind and due regard for <lb/>
            the blessed gods; perish not then senselessly by a death <lb/>
            of your own choosing, nor rush on at the heels of youthful <lb/>
            rashness. First I bid you let loose from the ship a dove, <lb/>
            and send her forth before you to try the way. And if she <lb/>
            fly safely on her wings through those rocks to the sea, no <lb/>
            longer do ye delay your voyage for any time, but stoutly <lb/>
            ply the oars in your hands and cleave through the strait <lb/>
            of sea, for now your life will depend, not so much on your <lb/>
            prayers, as on your stalwart arms. Wherefore leave all <lb/>
            other things alone and exert 2 yourselves bravely to the <lb/>
            utmost; yet ere you start, I do not forbid you to entreat <lb/>
            the gods. But if the dove be slain right in mid passage, <lb/>
            fare ye back again, for far better it is to yield to the death­ <lb/>
            less gods. For then could ye not escape an evil doom at <lb/>
            the rocks, no, not if Argo were made of iron. Ah! hapless <lb/>
            wights ! dare not to go beyond my warning, although ye <lb/>
            think me thrice as much the foe of the lords of heaven, <lb/>
            aye and even more hateful to them than I really am ; dare <lb/>
            not to sail yet further against the omen. And these things <lb/>
            shall be even as they may. But if ye escape the clashing <note type="footnote"> I <foreign xml:lang="grc">πέτρας</foreign>, i.e. the Symplegades, or " Clashers,” stood at the mouth of <lb/>

            of the rocks and come scatheless inside Pontus, forthwith <lb/>
            keep the Bithynian1 land upon your right, and sail cautiously <lb/>
            amid the breakers, till that ye round the swift current of <lb/>
            the river Rhebas and the Black headland, and be come to a <lb/>
            haven in the Thynian isle. Thence return a short stretch <lb/>
            across the sea, and beach your ship on the opposite shore <lb/>
            of the Mariandyni. There is a path down to Hades, and <lb/>
            the headland2 of Acherusia juts out and stretches itself on <lb/>
            high, and swirling Acheron, cutting through the foot of <lb/>
            the cliff, pours itself forth from a mighty ravine. Very <lb/>
            nigh to it shall ye pass by many hills of the Paphlagonians, <lb/>
            over whom Pelops first held sway in Enete,3 of whose blood <lb/>
            they avow them to be. Now there is a certain cliff that <lb/>
            fronts the circling * Bear, on all sides steep; men call it <lb/>
            Carambis ; above it the gusty north is parted in twain ; in <lb/>
            such wise is it turned toward the sea, towering to heaven. <lb/>
            At once when a man bath rounded it a wide beach stretches <lb/>
            before him, and at the end of that wide beach nigh to a <lb/>
            jutting cliff the stream of the river Halys 5 terribly dis­ <lb/>
            charges, and after him, but flowing near, the Iris rolls into <lb/>
            the sea, a lesser stream with clear ripples. Here in front <lb/>
            a great and towering bend stands out 6; next, Thermodon's <lb/>
            mouth flows into a sleeping bay near the Themiscyrean <lb/>
            headland, from its meandering through a wide continent. <note type="footnote"> 1 The Bosporus is bounded on the right by Bithynia, on the left by <lb/>

            There is the plain of Doias, and hard by are the triple <lb/>
            cities of the Amazons ; and after them the Chalybes 1 in­ <lb/>
            habit a rough and stubborn land, of all men most wretched, <lb/>
            labourers they, busied with working of iron. Near them <lb/>
            dwell the Tibareni, rich in sheep, beyond the Genetæan head­ <lb/>
            land, where is a temple of Zeus, lord of hospitality. Next <lb/>
            beyond this, but nigh thereto, the Mossynœci 2 hold the <lb/>
            woody mainland and the foot of the mountain, men that <lb/>
            have builded houses of timber with wooden battlements <lb/>
            and chambers deftly finished, which they call ' Mossynæ,’ <lb/>

            the skill ye may those ravening birds, which, men say, do <lb/>
            roost upon this desert isle in countless numbers. Therein <lb/>
            the queens of the Amazons builded a temple of stone to <lb/>
            Ares, even Otrere and Antiope, what time they went forth <lb/>
            to battle. Now here shall there come to you from out the <lb/>

            next the warlike Colchians themselves. But cleave on your <lb/>
            way, until ye come nigh to the inmost sea. There across <lb/>
            the Cytæan 1 mainland, from the Amarantian hills afar, and <lb/>
            the plain of Circe,2 the swirling Phasis rolls his broad <lb/>
            stream into the sea. Drive your ship into the mouth of <lb/>
            that river, and ye shall see the towers of Cytæan Æetes <lb/>

            to behold, watches from his ambush round the fleece as it <lb/>

          <p>So spake he; and as they hearkened, fear fell on them <lb/>
            forthwith. Long were they struck with speechlessness; at <lb/>
            last spake the hero, the son of iEson, sorely at a loss, " Old <lb/>
            man, lo! now hast thou rehearsed the end of our toilsome <lb/>
            voyage, and the sure sign, which if we obey we shall pass <lb/>
            through those loathed rocks to Pontus; but whether there <lb/>
            shall be a return again to Hellas for us, if we do escape <lb/>
            them, this too would I fain learn of thee. How am I to <lb/>
            act, how shall I come again over so wide a path of sea, in <lb/>
            ignorance myself and with a crew alike ignorant? for <lb/>
            Colchian Æa lieth at the uttermost end of Pontus and the <lb/>
            earth."</p>
          <p>So spake he, and to him did that old man make answer, <lb/>
            “ My child, as soon as thou hast escaped through those <lb/>
            rocks of death, be of good cheer, for a god will guide thee <lb/>
            on a different route from Æa; and toward Æa, there <lb/>
            shall be plenty to guide thee. Yea, friends, bethink you of <lb/>

            pared a glorious end to your toils. But question me no <lb/>
            further of these matters."</p>
          <p>So spake the son of Agenor, and the two sons of <lb/>
            Thracian Boreas came glancing down from heaven, and <lb/>
            set their rushing feet upon the threshold beside them. Up <lb/>
            sprang the heroes from their seats, when they saw them <lb/>
            coming near. And among the eager throng Zetes made <lb/>
            harangue, drawing great gasps for breath after his toil, and <lb/>
            told them how far they had journeyed, and how Iris pre­ <lb/>
            vented them from slaying the Harpies, and how the <lb/>
            goddess in her favour gave them an oath, and those others <lb/>
            slunk away in terror 'neath the vast cavern of the cliff of <lb/>
            Dicte. Glad then were all their comrades in the house, <lb/>
            -and Phineus himself, at the news. And quickly did the <lb/>
            son of Æson address the old man with right good will: " It <lb/>
            seems then, Phineus, some god there was who pitied thy <lb/>
            grievous misery, and brought us, too, hither from afar, that <lb/>
            the sons of Boreas might help thee; if but he would grant <lb/>
            the light unto thine eyes, methinks I would be even as glad <lb/>
            -as if I were on my homeward way."</p>
          <p>So spake he; but the other, with downcast face, answered <lb/>
            him: " Ah! son of Æson, that may never be recalled, nor <lb/>
            is there any remedy for that hereafter; for blasted 1 are my <lb/>
            sightless eyes. Instead thereof God grant me death 2 at <lb/>
            once, and after death shall I share in all festive joys."</p>
          <p>Thus these twain held converse together. And anon, in <lb/>
            no long space, as they talked, the dawn appeared; and the <lb/>
            neighbouring folk came round Phineus, they who even <lb/>
            aforetime gathered thither day by day, ever bringing a <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὑποσμὑχονται</foreign> literally = are smouldering away, a forcible word to <lb/>

            -but, to punish his folly, it was accompanied with blindness. </note> <pb n="68"/>

            portion of food for him in spite of all. And unto all of <lb/>
            them that aged man with good will gave oracles, whatso <lb/>
            feeble man might come; and he loosed many of their woes <lb/>
            by his divination ; wherefore they would visit and care for <lb/>
            him. With these came Paræbius, the man most dear to <lb/>
            him, and glad was he to hear them in his house. For long <lb/>
            before had he himself declared that an expedition of chief­ <lb/>
            tains, on its way from Hellas to the city of Æetes, should <lb/>
            fasten its cables to the Thynian1 land, and they should re­ <lb/>
            strain by Zeus's will the Harpies from coming to him. So <lb/>
            then that old man sent these men forth, winning them with <lb/>
            words of wisdom; only Paræbius he bade stay there with <lb/>
            the chieftains; and quickly he sent him forth, bidding him <lb/>
            bring thither the pick of all his sheep; and as he went out <lb/>
            from the hall, Phineus made harangue graciously amongst <lb/>
            the throng of rowers: " Friends, all men, I trow, are not <lb/>
            overweening, nor forgetful of a kindness. Thus yonder <lb/>
            man, brave soul as he is, came hither that he might learn <lb/>
            his fate.2 For when he toiled his best and worked his <lb/>
            hardest, even then above all repeated want of food would <lb/>
            waste him, and day on day was ever more miserable, nor <lb/>
            was there any respite from his suffering. But he was pay­ <lb/>
            ing a sad return for his father's sin; for he, cutting trees <lb/>
            alone on a day in the hills, slighted the prayer of a tree­ <lb/>
            nymph, who besought him with tears and earnest entreaty <lb/>
            not to cut the trunk of an oak that had grown up with her, <lb/>
            whereon she had passed many a long year together, but he, <lb/>
            in the senseless pride of youth, cut it down. Wherefore <lb/>
            did the nymph make her death unprofitable to him and his <lb/>
            children afterwards. Now I knew the sin, when he came <lb/>
            to me; so I bade him build an altar to the Thynian <lb/>
            nymph, and offer upon it sacrifice to cleanse the guilt, <lb/>
            praying for an escape from his father's doom. Then when <note type="footnote">1 Thynis, a part of Thrace upon the Bosporus.</note> <note type="footnote"> 2 <foreign xml:lang="grc">μόρον</foreign> here = " fate, destiny," not " death." </note> <pb n="69"/>

            he escaped the doom sent by the goddess, he never forget <lb/>
            nor ceased to care for me; and scarce can I send him to <lb/>
            the door, unwilling to depart, for he is fain to abide even <lb/>
            here with me in my distress."</p>
          <p>So spake the son of Agenor; and the other anon drew <lb/>
            nigh, driving two sheep from the fold. Then up stood <lb/>
            Jason, and up stood the sons of Boreas as the old man <lb/>
            bade them. Quickly they called on the name of prophetic <lb/>
            Apollo, and did sacrifice upon the hearth just as the day <lb/>
            was waning, and the young men of the crew made ready a <lb/>
            plenteous feast. Then when they had well feasted, some <lb/>
            laid them to rest by the cables of the ship, and some in <lb/>
            knots there in the house. At morn the steady summer <lb/>
            winds 1 began to blow, which breathe o'er the whole earth <lb/>
            equally, for such is the command of Zeus.</p>
          <p>There runs a legend that Cyrene2 once was herding sheep <lb/>
            along the marsh of the Peneus amongst the men of former <lb/>
            times, for her heart rejoiced in her maidenhood and virgin <lb/>
            couch. But Apollo caught her up from her shepherding <lb/>
            by the river far from Hæmonia, and set her down among <lb/>
            the maidens of the country who dwelt in Libya beside the <lb/>
            Myrtosian height. There she bare Aristæus unto Phoebus, <lb/>
            whom the Hæmonians, with their rich corn-lands, call "the <lb/>
            Hunter" and the Shepherd." For the god, for the love <lb/>
            of the nymph, granted her length of days and a home in <lb/>
            the country there, and brought her infant son to be reared <lb/>
            ’neath the cave of Chiron. And when he was grown, the <lb/>
            divine Muses found for him a wife, and taught him the <note type="footnote">1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐτήσιαι αὓραι</foreign>. According to the legend, a great drought prevailed <lb/>
            once in the Cyclades, when an oracle told the people to call in to their <lb/>
            aid Aristæus, the son of Apollo and Cyrene, from Phthia. He came to <lb/>
            Cos, and appeased Zeus with sacrifice; whereon that god sent a cool <lb/>
            breeze to blow upon the isle for forty days. Henceforth these winds <lb/>
            became annual during the summer, beginning when the sun is in the <lb/>
            last chamber of the Crab, and lasting until he enters the Lion. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 The mother of Aristaeus just mentioned. </note> <pb n="70"/>

            arts of healing and prophecy; and they made him the <lb/>
            keeper of their flocks, all that feed along the plain of <lb/>
            Athamas in Phthia, and around steep Othrys, and the <lb/>
            sacred stream of the river Apidanus. Now when the Dog­ <lb/>
            star 1 from heaven scorched up the islands of Minos,2 and for <lb/>
            a long space the inhabitants found no relief, then by the <lb/>
            advice of Hecatus they called him in to stay the plague. <lb/>
            So he left Phthia at the bidding of his father, and came to <lb/>
            dwell in Cos, having gathered thither the Parrhasian3 folk, <lb/>
            who are of the lineage of Lycaon; and he builded a mighty <lb/>
            altar to Zeus, the god of rain,4 and did fair sacrifice upon <lb/>
            the mountains to Sirius, that baleful star, and to Zeus <lb/>
            himself, the son of Cronos. Wherefore it is that the <lb/>
            Etesian winds blow cool across the earth for forty days <lb/>
            from Zeus; and even now in Cos priests offer sacrifices <lb/>
            before the rising of the Dog.</p>
          <p>So runs this legend; and the chiefs abode there by con­ <lb/>
            straint ;5 and every day the Thynians sent forth good store <lb/>
            of gifts for the strangers, out of favour for Phineus. After <lb/>
            this, when they had builded an altar to the twelve blessed <lb/>
            gods on the edge of the sea opposite, and had offered <lb/>
            sacrifice upon it, they went aboard their swift ship to row <lb/>
            away, nor did they forget to take with them a timorous <lb/>
            dove, but Euphemus clutched her in his hand, cowering <lb/>
            with terror, and carried her along, and they loosed their <lb/>
            double cables from the shore.</p>
          <p>Nor, I ween, had they started, ere Athene was ware of <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Σείριος</foreign>, i.e. the Dogstar, " the scorching star." </note><note type="footnote"> 2 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Μινωίδας</foreign>, i.e. the Cyclades, for Minos, king of Crete, held the <lb/>

            them, and forthwith and hastily she stepped upon a light <lb/>
            cloud, which should bear her at once for all her weight; <lb/>
            and she hasted on her way seaward, with kindly intent to <lb/>
            the rowers. As when a man goes wandering from his <lb/>
            country, as oft we men do wander in our hardihood, and <lb/>
            there is no land too far away, for every path lies open <lb/>
            before his eyes, when lo! he seeth in his mind his own <lb/>
            home, and withal there appeareth a way to it over land or <lb/>
            over sea, and keenly he pondereth this way and that, and <lb/>
            searcheth it out with his eyes; even so the daughter of <lb/>
            Zeus, swifty darting on, set foot upon the cheerless strand <lb/>
            1 of Thynia.</p>
          <p>Now they, when they came to the strait of the winding <lb/>
            passage, walled in with beetling crags on either side, while <lb/>
            an eddying current from below washed up against the ship <lb/>
            as it went on its way; and on they went in grievous fear, <lb/>
            and already on their ears the thud of clashing rocks smote <lb/>
            unceasingly, and the dripping cliffs roared; in that very <lb/>
            hour the hero Euphemus clutched the dove in his hand, <lb/>
            and went to take his stand upon the prow, while they, at <lb/>
            the bidding of Tiphys, son of Hagnias, rowed with a will, <lb/>
            that they might drive right through the rocks, trusting in <lb/>
            their might. And as they rounded a bend, they saw those <lb/>
            rocks opening for the last time of all. And their spirit melted <lb/>
            at the sight; but the hero Euphemus sent forth the dove <lb/>
            to dart through on her wings, and they, one and all, lifted <lb/>
            up their heads to see, and she sped through them, but at <lb/>
            once the two rocks met again with a clash ; and the foam <lb/>
            leapt up in a seething mass like a cloud, and grimly roared <lb/>
            the sea, and all around the great firmament bellowed. <lb/>
            And the hollow caves echoed beneath the rugged rocks as <lb/>
            the sea went surging in, and high on the cliffs was the <lb/>
            white spray vomited as the billow dashed upon them. <lb/>
            Then did the current spin the ship round. And the rocks <lb/>
            cut off just the tail-feathers of the dove, but she darted <pb n="72"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BOOK II."/><lb/>
            away unhurt. And loudly the rowers cheered, but Tiphys <lb/>
            himself shouted to them to row lustily, for once more the <lb/>
            rocks were opening. Then came trembling on them as <lb/>
            they rowed, until the wave with its returning wash came <lb/>
            and bore the ship within the rocks. Thereon most awful fear <lb/>
            seized on all, for above their head was death with no <lb/>
            escape ; and now on this side and on that lay broad Pontus <lb/>
            to their view, when suddenly in front rose up a mighty <lb/>
            arching wave, like to a steep hill, and they bowed down <lb/>
            their heads at the sight. For it seemed as if it must indeed <lb/>
            leap down and whelm the ship entirely. But Tiphys was <lb/>
            quick to ease her as she laboured, to the rowing, and the <lb/>
            wave rolled with all his force beneath the keel, and lifted <lb/>
            up the ship herself from underneath, far from the rocks, <lb/>
            and high on the crest of the billow she was borne. Then <lb/>
            did Euphemus go amongst all the crew, and call to them <lb/>
            to lay on to their oars with all their might, and they smote <lb/>
            the water at his cry. So she sprang forward twice as far <lb/>
            as any other ship would have yielded to rowers, and the <lb/>
            oars bent like curved bows as the heroes strained. In that <lb/>
            instant the vaulted wave was past them, and she at once <lb/>
            was riding over the furious billow like a roller, plunging <lb/>
            headlong forward o'er the trough of the sea. But the <lb/>
            eddying current stayed the ship in the midst of " the <lb/>
            Clashers," and they quaked on either side, and thundered, <lb/>
            and the ship-timbers throbbed. Then did Athene with her <lb/>
            left hand hold the stubborn rock apart, while with her <lb/>
            right she thrust them through upon their course; and the <lb/>
            ship shot through the air like a winged arrow. Yet the <lb/>
            rocks, ceaselessly dashing together, crushed off, in passing, <lb/>
            the tip of the carved stern. And Athene sped back to <lb/>
            Olympus, when they were escaped unhurt. But the rocks <lb/>
            closed up together, rooted firm for ever; even so was <lb/>
            it decreed by the blessed gods, whenso a man should have <lb/>
            passed through alive in his ship. And they, I trow, <pb n="73"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="L. 2575-639.]"/><lb/>
            drew breath again after their chilling fear, as they gazed <lb/>
            out upon the sky, and the expanse of sea spreading far and <lb/>
            wide. For verily they deemed that they were saved from <lb/>
            Hades, and Tiphys first made harangue: " Methinks we <lb/>
            have escaped this danger sure enough, we and the ship, <lb/>
            and there is no other we have to thank so much as Athene, <lb/>
            who inspired the ship with divine courage, when Argus <lb/>
            fastened her together with bolts; and it is not right that <lb/>
            she should be caught. Wherefore, son of Æson, no more <lb/>
            fear at all the bidding of thy king, since God hath granted <lb/>
            us to escape through the rocks, for Phineus, son of Agenor, <lb/>
            declared that, after this, toils, easy to master, should be ours."</p>
          <p>Therewith he made the ship speed past the Bithynian <lb/>
            coast across the sea. But the other answered him with <lb/>
            gentle words: " Ah! Tiphys, why comfort my heavy heart <lb/>
            thus ? I have sinned, and upon me has come a grievous <lb/>
            blindness I may not cope with ; for I should have refused <lb/>
            this journey outright at once when Pelias ordained it, even <lb/>
            though I was to have died, torn ruthlessly limb from limb; <lb/>
            but now do I endure 1 exceeding terror, and troubles past <lb/>
            bearing, in deadly dread to sail across the chill paths of <lb/>
            the deep, in deadly dread whene'er we land. For on all <lb/>
            sides are enemies. And ever as the days go by, I watch <lb/>
            through the dreary night, and think of all, since first ye <lb/>
            mustered for my sake ; and lightly dost thou speak, caring <lb/>
            only for thine 2 own life, while I fear never so little for my­ <lb/>
            self, but for this man and for that, for thee and the rest of <lb/>

            cried out with words of cheer. And his heart was glad <lb/>
            within him at their exhorting, and once more he spake to <lb/>
            them outright, " My friends, your bravery makes me more <lb/>
            bold. Wherefore now no more will I let fear fasten on <lb/>
            me, even though I must voyage across the gulf of Hades, <lb/>

          <p>So spake he, and forthwith they ceased from such words, <lb/>
            and toiled in rowing unceasingly, and soon they passed by <lb/>
            Rhebas, that swiftly-rushing river, and the rock of Colone, <lb/>
            and, not long after, the Black headland, and, next, the <lb/>
            mouth of the river Phyllis,1 where aforetime Dipsacus <lb/>
            received the son of Athamas in his house what time he <lb/>
            was flying, together with the ram, from the city of Orcho­ <lb/>
            menus; his mother was a meadow-nymph, and he loved <lb/>
            not wanton deeds, but gladly dwelt with his mother by the <lb/>
            waters of his father, feeding flocks upon the shore. And <lb/>
            quickly they sighted and passed by his shrine, and the <lb/>
            river's broad banks and the plain and Calpe with its deep <lb/>
            stream; and day by day, the calm night through, they bent <lb/>
            to their unresting oars. As ploughing oxen do toil in <lb/>
            cleaving a moist fallow-field, and the sweat trickles in great <lb/>
            drops from their flanks and neck, and they keep turning <lb/>
            their eyes askance from under the yoke, while the parched <lb/>
            breath from their mouths comes ever snorting forth, and <lb/>

            Thynian isle with laboured toil, and went ashore. And <lb/>
            to them appeared the son of Leto, coming up from far <lb/>
            Lycia, on his way to the countless race of the Hyperboreans; <lb/>
            and clustering locks of gold streamed down his cheeks as <lb/>
            he came; and in his left hand he held his silver bow, while <lb/>
            about his back was slung his quiver from his shoulders ; <lb/>
            beneath his feet the island quaked throughout, and on the <lb/>
            shore the waves surged up. And they were filled with <lb/>
            wild alarm when they caught sight of him, and none dare <lb/>
            gaze into the god's fair eyes. But there they stood with <lb/>
            heads bowed low upon the ground, till he was far on his <lb/>
            way to sea through the air ; then at last spake Orpheus, <lb/>
            thus declaring his word to the chieftains, " Come now, let <lb/>
            us call this island the sacred isle of Apollo, god of dawn, <lb/>
            for that he was seen by all passing over it at dawn, and let <lb/>
            us sacrifice such things as we may, when we have raised <lb/>
            an altar on the strand ; but if hereafter he grant us a safe <lb/>
            return to the land of Hæmonia, then surely will we lay <lb/>
            upon his altar the thighs of hornèd goats. And now, as ye <lb/>
            may, I bid you win his favour with the steam of sacrifice. <lb/>
            Be gracious, 0 be gracious in thy appearing, prince! "</p>
          <p>So spake he; and some at once made an altar of shingle,2 <lb/>
            while others roamed the island in quest of fawns or wild <lb/>
            goats if haply they might see aught of either, such beasts <lb/>
            as oft do seek their food in a wood's depths. And for <lb/>
            them the son of Leto found a quarry; then with pious rites <lb/>
            they wrapped the thigh bones 3 of them all in a roll of fat <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀμφιλύκη</foreign>, an adj. agreeing with <foreign xml:lang="grc">νύξ</foreign> understood, i.e. the gray <lb/>

            and burned them on the sacred altar, calling on the name <lb/>
            of Apollo, god of dawn. And they stood in a wide ring <lb/>
            around the burning sacrifice, chanting this hymn to Phœbus, <lb/>
            " Hail, all hail! fair healing god ; " 1 while the goodly son <lb/>
            of (Eager led for them their clear song on his Bistonian2 <lb/>
            lyre, telling how on a day beneath Parnassus' rocky ridge <lb/>
            he slew the monster snake Delphine with his bow, while <lb/>
            yet a beardless youth, proud of his long locks. " 0 be <lb/>
            gracious, ever be thy hair uncut,3 my prince, ever free from <lb/>
            hurt, for thus 'tis right. Only Leto herself, daughter of <lb/>
            Cams, fondles it in her hands." And the Corycian4 <lb/>
            nymphs, daughters of Pleistus, oft took up the cheering <lb/>
            strain, crying, "Hail, all hail! " 1 This then was the fair <lb/>
            refrain they chanted to Phœbus.</p>
          <p>Now when they had celebrated 6 him with song and dance, <lb/>
            they took an oath by the holy drink-offering, that verily <lb/>
            they would help one another for ever in unity of purpose, <lb/>
            laying their hand upon the sacrifice; and still to this day <lb/>
            there stands a temple there to cheerful Unity, the temple <note type="footnote"> bones were specially reserved for sacrifice to the gods; they were <lb/>

          <p>Now when the third day was come, then did they leave <lb/>
            that steep isle with a fresh west wind. Thence they sighted <lb/>
            over against them the mouth of the river Sangarius,1 and <lb/>
            the fruitful land of the Mariandyni and the streams of <lb/>
            Lycus and the lake of Anthemoisia, and by them they <lb/>
            passed. And as they ran before the breeze, the ropes and <lb/>
            tackling throughout the ship were shaken; at dawn, for <lb/>
            the wind dropped during the night, they were glad to­ <lb/>
            reach the haven of the Acherusian headland, which rises <lb/>
            up with steep beetling crags, facing the Bithynian sea; <lb/>
            beneath it are rooted smooth sea-washed rocks, and round <lb/>
            them the billow rolls and thunders loud, but above, upon <lb/>
            the top, grow spreading plane trees. Further inland from <lb/>
            this lieth a glen in the hollow, where is the cave of Hades,2 <lb/>
            roofed in with trees and rocks, whence an icy blast, <lb/>
            breathing always from the chill den within, ever freezeth <lb/>
            the sparkling rime, that thaws again beneath the noonday <lb/>
            sun. Never spreads silence o'er that grim3 headland, but <lb/>
            there is a confused murmur of the booming sea, and of <lb/>
            leaves rustling in the wind within. There too is the mouth <lb/>
            of the river Acheron, which discharges through the head­ <lb/>
            land and falleth into the sea eastward; a hollow chasm <lb/>
            brings it down from above. The Megarians of Nisae. <lb/>
            called it in after-times " Saviour of Mariners," when they <lb/>
            were about to settle in the land of the Mariandyni. For <lb/>

            through the Acherusian headland and anchored insider just <lb/>
            as the wind was dropping.</p>
          <p>No long time,2 I trow, could the slavers of Amycus, as <lb/>
            report had told, anchor without the knowledge of Lycus, <lb/>
            lord of that mainland, or of the Mariandyni; but they made <lb/>
            even a league with them on that account. And they wel­ <lb/>
            comed Polydeuces himself as he had been a god, gathering <lb/>
            from all sides, for long time had they warred bitterly <lb/>
            against the overweening Bebryces. And so it was that <lb/>
            at once within the halls of Lycus they made ready a feast <lb/>
            that day with all good will, going to the city, and rejoiced <lb/>
            their hearts with converse.</p>
          <p>And the son of Æson declared his lineage and the name <lb/>
            of each of his crew, and the commands of Pelias, and how <lb/>
            they were entertained by the women of Lemnos, and all <lb/>
            that they did in Cyzicus, city of the 'Doliones, and how <lb/>
            they came to Mysia and Chios, where they left the hero <lb/>
            Heracles against their will; also he declared the message <lb/>
            of Glaucus, and told how they smote the Bebryces and <lb/>
            Amycus, and of the prophecies and misery of Phineus, and <lb/>
            how they escaped the Cyanean rocks, and met the son of <lb/>
            Leto at the island. And the heart of Lycus was charmed <lb/>
            at listening to his tale, and thus spake he amongst them <lb/>
            all: " My friends, what a man is he whose aid ye have lost <lb/>
            in your long, long voyage to Æetes! For well I mind seeing <lb/>
            him here in the halls of my father Dascylus, what time he <lb/>

            with the down just sprouting on my chin. Then1 when our <lb/>
            brother Priolaus was slain by the Mysians, whom from <lb/>
            that day forth the people mourn in piteous elegies, he <lb/>
            entered the lists with Titias the mighty, and vanquished <lb/>
            him in boxing, a man who excelled all our young men in <lb/>
            build and might; and he dashed his teeth upon the ground. <lb/>
            Moreover he subdued to my father Phrygians and Mysians <lb/>
            together, who inhabit the lands nigh to us, and took for <lb/>
            his own the tribes of the Bithynians with their land, as <lb/>
            far as the mouth of the Rhebas and the rock of Colone ; <lb/>
            next the Paphlagonians, sprung from Pelops, yielded with­ <lb/>
            out fight, all whom the black water of Billæus breaks <lb/>
            around. But now the Bebryces and the violence of <lb/>
            Amycus did separate me from Heracles, who dwells afar, <lb/>
            for they have long cut great slices from my land, till they <lb/>
            set their boundaries at the water-meadows of the Hypius. <lb/>
            Yet have they paid the penalty to you, and I trow that he, <lb/>
            the son of Tyndarus, brought not death this day upon the <lb/>
            Bebryces without the will of heaven, what time he slew <lb/>
            yon man. Wherefore now whatso thanks I can return, <lb/>
            that will I right gladly. For that is right for weaklings, <lb/>
            when others that be stronger than them begin to help <lb/>
            them; so with you all and in your company I charge <lb/>

          <p>So then, the livelong day, they took their pastime at the <lb/>
            feast, but at dawn they went down in haste unto the ship, <lb/>
            yea, and with them went Lycus too, bringing countless <lb/>
            gifts to bear away, for with them was he sending from his <lb/>
            house his son to fare.</p>
          <p>There the doom of his fate smote Idmon, son of <lb/>
            Abas, most excellent seer; yet could not his divining <lb/>
            save him, for fate led him on to die. For within the water- <lb/>
            mead beside the reedy river lay a boar, with white tusks, <lb/>
            cooling his flanks and huge belly in the mud, a deadly <lb/>
            monster, whereof even the nymphs that haunt the meads <lb/>
            were afraid ; and no man knew of his being there, for all <lb/>
            alone along the broad marsh he browsed. Now he, the son <lb/>
            of Abas, was passing by the springs of that muddy river, <lb/>
            when lo ! the boar leapt up from some unseen lair among <lb/>
            the reeds and charged and smote him on the thigh, cutting <lb/>
            sinews and bone right in twain. And with one bitter cry1 <lb/>
            down fell he upon the ground, and his comrades flocking <lb/>
            round cried o'er their smitten fellow. But Peleus made <lb/>
            one quick lunge with his hunting-spear at the boar as he <lb/>
            darted in flight into the marsh, and out he rushed again <lb/>
            to charge them, but Idas smote him, and with one grunt <lb/>
            he fell grovelling about the sharp spear. And there they <lb/>
            left him on the ground where he fell, and sorrowfully bare <lb/>
            their swooning comrade to the ship, but he died in his <lb/>
            companions' arms.</p>
          <p>So they stayed them from all thought of sailing, and <lb/>
            abode in bitter grief for the burial of the dead man. Three <lb/>
            full days they mourned, and on the fourth made him a <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὀξὺ κλάγξας</foreign>, "with one sharp cry." Notice the true force of the <lb/>

            splendid funeral; and the people, with Lycus their king as <lb/>
            well, joined in the funeral rites ; and at the grave-side they <lb/>
            cut the throats of countless sheep, as is the meed of the <lb/>
            departed. So in that land this warrior's cairn was heaped, <lb/>
            and upon it is a sign' for those who may yet be born to see, <lb/>
            a log of wild olive such as ships are builded of, which <lb/>
            putteth forth her leaf a little below the Acherusian head­ <lb/>
            land. Yea, and if I must needs declare this also clearly in <lb/>
            my song, Phœbus bade the Bœotians, who came from Nisæa, <lb/>
            worship him, nothing doubting, as the protector of their <lb/>
            city, and found a town about that log of ancient olive ; <lb/>
            but2 these to-day do honour to Agamestor instead of Idmon, <lb/>
            god-like son of Æolus.</p>
          <p>Who next did die ? that3 must I tell; for yet again the <lb/>
            heroes piled a barrow for a comrade dead. For verily there <lb/>
            are yet two tombs of those two men to be seen. 'Tis said <lb/>
            that Tiphys, son of Hagnias, died, for it was not appointed <lb/>
            him to voyage further. Nay, a short illness closed there <lb/>
            his eyes far from his fatherland,4 while his company were <lb/>
            burying the dead son of Abas. And bitter was the grief <lb/>
            they felt at this cruel woe. For when they had buried him <lb/>
            too beside the other there, they threw themselves down in <lb/>
            their distress before the sea, closely wrapped from head to <lb/>
            foot, and never a word they spake nor had they any thought <lb/>
            for meat or drink, but sorrow made their spirit droop ; for <lb/>

            shall set over the helm, none shall harm our voyaging. <lb/>
            But quickly tell all this comfort out; then boldly rouse <lb/>
            them to a remembrance of their labour."</p>
          <p>So spake he, and the heart of the other went out to2 him <lb/>
            in gladness; and anon, without delay, he made harangue <lb/>
            in their midst, " God help us, sirs ! why nurse we thus our <lb/>
            grief in vain ? The dead, I trow, have died the death that <lb/>
            fell to their lot, but there are amongst us, methinks, helms­ <lb/>
            men in our company, aye, plenty of them. Wherefore <lb/>
            delay we no more our attempt, but up to your work, cast­ <lb/>
            ing sorrow to the winds."</p>
          <p>To him the son of Æson made answer, much perplexed: <lb/>
            " Son of Æacus, where then be these steersmen ? For they <lb/>
            whom aforetime we boasted were men of skill, hang down <lb/>
            their heads, more vexed at me than ever. Wherefore I fore­ <lb/>
            see a sorry fate for us as well as for the dead, if indeed it <lb/>
            be our lot neither to come to the city of baleful JEetes, nor <lb/>
            ever again to pass the rocks and reach the land of Hellas; <lb/>
            for here will a miserable doom hide us without fame, till <lb/>
            we grow old for nought." So spake he; but right speedily <note type="footnote"> 1 A river in Samos, formerly called Parthenius. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὀρέξατο</foreign>—<foreign xml:lang="grc">ὀρέγω</foreign>, literally " I reach out;" perhaps our phrase " went <lb/>

            Ancæus took upon him to steer the swift ship, for verily lie <lb/>
            was turned thereto by the prompting of the goddess. And <lb/>
            after him arose Erginus and Nauplius and Euphemus, all <lb/>
            eager for to steer. But these did they hold therefrom, for <lb/>
            many of the crew would have Ancæus.</p>
          <p>So they went aboard on the twelfth day at dawn ; for <lb/>
            lo! a strong west wind did blow for them, and quickly they <lb/>
            passed through the Acheron with rowing ; and, trusting to <lb/>
            the wind, they shook out their sails, and so sped calmly on <lb/>
            a goodly stretch under canvas. Quickly came they past <lb/>
            the mouth of the river Callichorus,l where, men say, the <lb/>
            Nysean son of Zeus, what time he left the tribes of India <lb/>
            and came to dwell in Thebes, held his revels and led the <lb/>
            dance before the cave, wherein he would sleep away the <lb/>

            around do call that river " Stream of fair dancing," and <lb/>
            -that cave the Bedchamber,” 3 after him.</p>
          <p>. Sailing thence they saw the tomb of Sthenelus,4 son of <note type="footnote">1 A river in Paphlagonia sacred to Dionysus, because he had held <lb/>

            poor man on earth than lord it over all the souls in Hades. This passage <lb/>
            here portrays the soul of another brave man craving, with many tears, <lb/>

            Actor, who on his way back from the bold fight with the <lb/>
            Amazons-for thither had he gone with Heracles—died <lb/>
            there upon the beach, of an arrow wound. So then they <lb/>
            sailed on no further. For Persephone herself sent forth <lb/>
            the spirit of the son of Actor, at his piteous prayer, to gaze a <lb/>
            little on men of like passions with himself. So he took his <lb/>
            stand on the summit of his tomb and watched for the ship, <lb/>
            in form even as when he went to the war, and on his head <lb/>
            shone his four-plumed helmet with the blood-red crest. <lb/>
            And then he passed once more beneath the mighty gloom; <lb/>
            but they marvelled at the sight, and Mopsus, son of <lb/>
            Ampycus, did prophesy, and bade them anchor there and <lb/>
            appease the spirit with drink-offerings. So they quickly <lb/>
            furled the sails, and making fast the cables on the strand <lb/>
            were busied about the tomb of Sthenelus, pouring libations <lb/>
            to him, and offering sheep as victims. Moreover they did <lb/>
            build, besides pouring libations, an altar to Apollo, pro­ <lb/>
            tector of ships, and burnt sheep thereon; and there <lb/>
            Orpheus dedicated his lyre, whence that place is called <lb/>
            " the Lyre."</p>
          <p>Anon, as the wind blew strong, they went aboard; and <lb/>
            set the sail and made it taut to either sheet; 1 and Argo was <lb/>
            carried at full speed to sea, even as when a falcon aloft <lb/>
            through the air spreading his wings to the blast goes <lb/>
            swiftly on his way, swerving not in his swoop, as he poises <lb/>
            on steady pinions. And so they passed by the streams of <lb/>
            Parthenius,2 murmuring to the sea, gentlest of rivers, <lb/>
            wherein the virgin child of Leto doth cool her limbs in its <lb/>
            lovely waters, whenso she ascendeth to heaven from the <lb/>

            they sailed out past Sesamus and the steep Erythinian <lb/>
            hills, Crobialus, and Cromne, and wooded Cytorus. Next <lb/>
            after doubling Carambis, as the sun was rising, they rowed <lb/>
            all day and all night too along a vast stretch of sand.</p>
          <p>Anon they set foot on the soil of Assyria, where Zeus, <lb/>
            tricked by his own promise, set down Sinope, daughter of <lb/>
            Asopus, and granted her her virgin state. For verily he <lb/>
            longed for her love; so the great god promised to give her <lb/>
            whatsoever her heart desired; and she in her cunning <lb/>
            asked her maidenhood. So too did she beguile Apollo, <lb/>
            eager for her love, and after them the river Halys; nor did <lb/>
            any man ever subdue her in love's embrace. There were <lb/>
            dwelling even yet at that day the sons of noble Deimachus, <lb/>
            prince of Triccæ, Deileon and Autolycus and Phlogius, <lb/>
            after they had wandered away from Heracles. Now these, <lb/>
            when they marked the expedition of the chieftains, came <lb/>
            forth to meet them, and told them truly who they were; <lb/>
            for they had no wish to abide there any longer, but went <lb/>
            aboard the ship, soon as ever the clear' south-wind blew. <lb/>
            So in their company they sped before the swift breeze, and <lb/>
            left the river Halys, and Iris, that flows hard by, yea, and <lb/>
            that part2 of Syria that these have formed; and on that day <lb/>
            they rounded the distant headland of the Amazons, that <lb/>
            shutteth in their harbour.</p>
          <p>There on a day the hero Heracles laid in ambush for <lb/>
            Melanippe, daughter of Aretius, as she came forth; and, <lb/>
            in ransom for her sister, Hippolyte gave him her dazzling <lb/>
            girdle; so he set her free uuhurt. <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀργεστα̃ο</foreign>, from <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀργός</foreign>, " bright, shining," the same word that appears <lb/>

          <p><note type="correspondsTo" n="[BOOK II."/>They then anchored in a bay behind the headland, at the. <lb/>
            mouth of the Thermodon, for the sea was rising against <lb/>
            their going. This river hath no counterpart, nor is there <lb/>
            any other that sendetli forth from itself upon the earth so <lb/>
            many streams. If a man should count each up, there <lb/>
            would lack but four of a hundred.1 Yet is there only one <lb/>
            real spring, which cometh down from high mountains unto <lb/>
            the land. Men say these are called the Amazonian moun­ <lb/>
            tains. Thence it spreads straight over a somewhat hilly <lb/>
            country far inland, wherefore it hath a winding course, and <lb/>
            ever it twists in different directions, wheresoever it can <lb/>
            best find a flat country; one branch far away, another near <lb/>
            at hand; and there be many of them, of which no man <lb/>
            knoweth, where they lose themselves in the sand; but it, <lb/>
            mingling with a few openly, discharges its archinga2 flood of <lb/>
            foam into cheerless Pontus. And now would they have <lb/>
            stayed to do battle with the Amazons; nor would they, I <lb/>
            trow, have striven without bloodshed, for the Amazons are <lb/>
            no gentle folk, and cared not for justice in their dwellings <lb/>
            on the plain of Doias; nay, their thoughts were set on <lb/>
            deeds of grievous violence, and the works of Ares; for they, <lb/>
            indeed, drew their stock from Ares and the nymph Har­ <lb/>
            monia, who bare these warrior daughters unto him, what <lb/>
            time she won his love in the dells of the Acmonian grove <lb/>
            but once more, from Zeus mayhap, came the breath of the <lb/>
            clear south-wind. And Argo left the round headland <lb/>
            before the wind, where the Themiscyrean Amazons were <lb/>
            doing on their harness.</p>
          <p>These dwelt not all together in one city, but were <lb/>
            scattered over the land by tribes in three bodies ; apart <note type="footnote"> 1 A curiously roundabout way of saying that there are ninety-six dis­ <lb/>

            were those over whom Hippolyte was then queen; and <lb/>
            apart dwelt the Lycastiæ, and apart the Chadesiæ, who <lb/>
            hurl the spear. On the next day, as night drew on, they <lb/>
            came unto the land of the Chalybes. These take no thought <lb/>
            for ploughing with oxen, nor for any planting of luscious <lb/>
            fruit; neither do they, strange folk, herd cattle in the <lb/>
            dewy pasture. But cleaving open the stubborn earth with <lb/>
            her store of iron, they do take therefrom a wage to barter <lb/>
            for food ; for them dawn never riseth without toil, but mid <lb/>
            soot and flame and smoke 1 they endure their heavy labour.</p>
          <p>Anon, after these, they doubled the headland of Zeus, <lb/>
            the great father, and sailed safely by the land of the <lb/>
            Tibareni. Here it is that when the women bear children <lb/>
            to the men, 'tis the men that throw themselves upon their <lb/>
            beds and groan, with their heads veiled, while the women <lb/>
            tend them carefully with food, and get ready for them the <lb/>
            bath they use after child-birth.2</p>
          <p>Next they passed the Holy mountain and land, wherein <lb/>
            upon the hills dwell the Mossynœci in wooden houses, and <lb/>
            hence they have their name. Strange is their justice; <lb/>
            strange their ordinances. All that men may do openly, <lb/>
            either among the people or in the market-place, all this they <lb/>
            perform at home; but all that we do in our houses, that <lb/>
            do they out of doors in the midst of the streets, with none <lb/>
            to blame. In love is there no modesty among this people, <lb/>
            but like swine that feed in herds, caring not a jot for the <lb/>
            .presence of any, they lie with their women upon the ground. <lb/>
            Now their king sitteth in a house of wood, high above the <lb/>
            rest, and declareth just judgment to the throng of folk. <lb/>
            Poor wretch! for if haply he do err at all in his judging, <lb/>
            they keep him shut up that day without food.</p>

            their way, till they were almost opposite to the isle of <lb/>
            Ares, for towards dusk the light breeze failed. Already <lb/>
            they saw one of those birds of Ares that haunt the isle <lb/>
            come swooping through the air from above, which did <lb/>
            stretch his pinions o'er the speeding ship and shoot against <lb/>
            her a sharp feather, and it fell on the left shoulder of <lb/>
            goodly Oileus ; and lie let his oar fall from his hands, for <lb/>
            he was wounded; but they marvelled to see the feathered <lb/>
            shaft. And Eribotes from his seat hard by drew forth the <lb/>
            feather and bound up the wound, having loosed the baldric <lb/>
            hanging from his own scabbard; and lo ! there appeared <lb/>
            another swooping down after the former, but the hero <lb/>
            Clytius, the son of Eurytus slew it, for he had ere this <lb/>
            stretched his bended bow, and he shot a swift arrow at the <lb/>
            bird, even as it flew above; and it fell with a rush hard by the <lb/>
            swift ship ; then amongst them spake Amphidamas, the <lb/>
            son of Aleus : " Nigh to us is the isle of Ares ; be sure of <lb/>
            that from seeing these birds with your own eyes. And I <lb/>
            think that arrows will not help us much to disembark; <lb/>
            but let us provide some other counsel for our help, if haply <lb/>
            ye mean to anchor here, mindful of the bidding of Phineus. <lb/>
            For not even Heracles, when he came to Arcadia, was able <lb/>
            to drive away with his arrows the birds that swam Ion on the <lb/>
            Stymphalian mere; that saw I with mine own eyes. But <lb/>
            he, shaking his rattling bronze armour in his hands, did <lb/>
            raise a din upon a lofty height, and they were scared afar, <lb/>
            screaming in frightful terror. Wherefore now let us too <lb/>
            devise some such plan, and I will tell you myself, since I <lb/>
            have ere this thought upon it. Put on your heads your <lb/>
            high-crested helmets, and half of you take turns at rowing, <lb/>
            and the other half guard' the ship with polished spears and <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">πλωίδας</foreign>, so called because they swam about the Stymphalian lake <lb/>

             <note type="correspondsTo" n="L. 1033-1099.]"/><lb/>
            bucklers. And at .once raise a mighty shout all together, <lb/>
            that they may be scared by the uproar, from being unused <lb/>
            thereto, and the nodding plumes and uplifted spears. And <lb/>
            if we reach the island itself, then shout and raise a hideous <lb/>
            din by smiting on your shields."</p>
          <p>So spake he ; and his helpful counsel pleased them all; <lb/>
            so about their heads they put their brazen helmets, dread­ <lb/>
            fully flashing, and upon them waved the blood-red plumes. <lb/>
            And part took turns at rowing, while the rest with sword <lb/>
            and shield did guard the ship. As when a man doth roof <lb/>
            a house with tiles, an ornament to his house and a defence <lb/>
            against the rain, as one tile is fitted firmly on another; so <lb/>
            they covered in the ship with a pent-house of shields. And <lb/>
            as the clash that goeth up from a warlike throng of men in <lb/>
            motion, what time the lines of battle meet, even such was <lb/>
            the sound that rose into the air on high from the ship. <lb/>
            Nor could they see any of the birds the while, but when <lb/>
            they drew nigh the island and smote upon their bucklers, <lb/>
            forthwith those birds rose in thousands, flying this way and <lb/>
            that. As when the son of Cronos sends a heavy hailstorm <lb/>
            from the clouds on city and houses, and they who dwell <lb/>
            beneath them hear the rattle on their roofs and sit in <lb/>
            silence, for the wintry season is not come upon them un­ <lb/>
            awares, but ere its coming have they made fast the roof; <lb/>
            even so the birds let loose on them a thick shower of shafts, <lb/>
            as they darted high o'er the sea to the hills on the farther <lb/>
            shore.</p>
          <p>What did Phineus mean, (that must I tell,) in bidding <lb/>
            the divine company of heroes anchor here ? or what help <lb/>
            was to come to them at their desire ? The sons of Phrixus <lb/>
            had gone on board a Colchian ship, and were faring to the <lb/>
            city of Orchomenus from Æa, at the direction of Cytæan <lb/>
            Æetes, that they might take unto themselves the boundless <lb/>
            wealth of their father, for he, as he lay a-dying, laid this <lb/>
            journey on them. And very nigh were they to the island <pb n="90"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BOOK II."/><lb/>
            on that day. But Zeus stirred up the .mighty north-wind <lb/>
            to blow, marking the wet path of Arcturus in the waves ; <lb/>
            so all day long he shook the leaves upon the mountains a <lb/>
            little, blowing lightly on the topmost branches, but at night <lb/>
            came he seaward in his giant strength, roaring and stirring <lb/>
            the billow with his breath ; and a dark mist veiled the sky, <lb/>
            nor were the bright stars to be seen from the clouds, but a <lb/>
            curtain of gloom settled over all. And they, the sons of <lb/>
            Phrixus, dripping and in terror of a fearsome death, were <lb/>
            drifting thus before the waves. Aud the furious wind rent <lb/>
            their sails, yea, and brake their ship in pieces, shaken as it <lb/>
            was by the breakers. Then by heaven's guidance those <lb/>
            four men seized hold upon a mighty beam, such as were <lb/>
            scattered in plenty, after the wreck, held together by sharp <lb/>
            bolts. And them did the waves and the breath of the wind <lb/>
            drive in sore distress unto the island, within a little of death. <lb/>
            Anon there burst on them a wondrous 1 storm of rain, and <lb/>
            it rained over the sea and the island, and all the coast over <lb/>
            against the island, where dwelt the haughty Mossynœci. <lb/>
            And the onset of the wave hurled them, the sons of Phrixus, <lb/>
            together with the stout beam, upon the beach of the island <lb/>
            in the gloom of night; but at sunrise it ceased, that heaven­ <lb/>
            sent torrent, and quickly they drew nigh and met one an­ <lb/>
            other, and Argus first made harangue;­</p>
          <p>" By Zeus, who seeth all, we do entreat you, whosoever <lb/>
            ye be, to be favourable and help us at our need. For rough <lb/>
            tempests, grievously buffeting the sea, have scattered piece­ <lb/>

            rid of the sons of Phrixus, had encouraged them to undertake their <lb/>
            voyage to Orcbomenus, but had purposely given them an unseaworthy <lb/>
            ship that they might be wrecked. He was afraid of them, because an oracle <lb/>
            had warned him of dangers to come from his own family. He failed to guess <lb/>
            that Medea, not Chalciope and her sons, was the real cause of danger. </note> <pb n="91"/>

            implore you, if ye will hearken, give us some rag to wrap <lb/>
            around our skin and take us hence, in pity for companions <lb/>
            in adversity. Yea, reverence suppliant strangers for the <lb/>
            sake of Zeus, the god of strangers and suppliants ; for we <lb/>
            are both suppliants of Zeus and strangers. And, I trow, <lb/>
            he hath his eye even upon us."</p>
          <p>Him in answer did the son of Æson question carefully, <lb/>
            for he thought that the prophecies of Phineus were being <lb/>
            accomplished, " Anon will we provide all these things with <lb/>
            good will. But come now, tell me truly, in what country <lb/>
            ye dwell, and the business that bids you fare across the sea, <lb/>
            and your own famous name and lineage."</p>
          <p>And Argus answered him in helpless misery, " Haply ye <lb/>
            have heard yourselves even aforetime, I deem, and of a <lb/>
            surety, how one Phrixus, son of Æolus, came from Hellas <lb/>
            unto Æa,—that Phrixus, who came to the town of Æetes, <lb/>
            sitting astride a ram, the rani that Hermes made of gold; <lb/>
            yea, and even now might ye see the fleece fluttering on the <lb/>
            rough branches of an oak. For afterwards, by the ram's <lb/>
            own counsel, Phrixus sacrificed him to Zeus, the son of <lb/>
            Cronos, who helpeth fugitives,1 before all other gods. Him <lb/>
            did Æetes receive into his house and gave to him his <lb/>
            daughter Chalciope without gifts of wooing in the gladness <lb/>
            of his heart. From these twain are we sprung. But he, <lb/>
            even Phrixus, died long ago, full of years, in the halls of <lb/>
            Æetes ; and we, obeying our father's command, set out at <lb/>
            once to Orchomenus to take the possessions of Athamas. <lb/>
            And if, as thou sayest, thou hast a mind to learn our name, <lb/>
            lo! this man is called Cytisorus, and this Phrontis, and <lb/>
            that Melas, and me myself shall ye call Argus."</p>
          <p>So spake he; and the chieftains were glad at the meet­ <lb/>
            ing, and they crowded round them in wonder. But Jason <note type="footnote"> I <foreign xml:lang="grc">Φυξιος</foreign>. Zeus was worshipped under this title amongst the Thes­ <lb/>
            salians. </note> <pb n="92"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BOOK II."/><lb/>
            again made answer thus, as was fitting : “Why, lo! ye <lb/>
            come as kinsmen 1 of my father and be- In our kindly aid in <lb/>
            your wretchedness. For Cretheus and Athamas were <lb/>
            brothers; and I, the grandson of Cretheus, am on my way <lb/>
            with these my comrades from Hellas itself into the city of <lb/>
            Æetes. But we will speak of these matters yet again to <lb/>
            each other; but first put on raiment; for by heaven's <lb/>
            guidance, I ween, have ye come to my hands in your <lb/>
            need."</p>
          <p>Therewith he gave them raiment from the ship to put <lb/>
            on. And at once thereafter made they for the temple of <lb/>
            Ares, to offer sacrifice of sheep, and right eagerly they set <lb/>
            themselves about the altar, which stood outside the roofless <lb/>
            temple, built of pebbles ; within is a black stone planted, <lb/>
            the holy stone whereto in days gone by all the Amazons <lb/>
            did pray, nor was it lawful, when these did come from the <lb/>
            mainland opposite, to burn sacrifices of oxen and sheep <lb/>
            upon this altar, but they kept great herds of horses and <lb/>
            sacrificed them. Now when the heroes had done sacrifice <lb/>
            and eaten the feast they had prepared, then did the son of <lb/>
            Æson take up his parable and begin to speak : " Zeus hath <lb/>
            still his eye on all things, I trow; and of a surety we men <lb/>
            escape not his ken, those of us who be god-fearing, nor yet <lb/>
            those who be just; for even so he rescued your father from <lb/>
            a murderous step-mother,2 and gave him boundless wealth <lb/>
            away from her; and even so hath he also rescued you un­ <lb/>
            hurt from the destroying storm. And ye may fare upon <lb/>
            this ship this way or that, whither ye list, either to Æa, or <lb/>
            to the rich city of goodly Orchomenus. For 'twas Athene <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">γνωτοὶ</foreign> = <foreign xml:lang="grc">συγγενει̃ς</foreign>. The relationship comes thus : Cretheus and <lb/>
            Athamas were brothers. Æson was the son of Cretheus, Jason the son <lb/>
            of Æson. Phrixus was the son of Athamas, Argus the son of Phrixus. <lb/>
            Jason and Argus were therefore cousins. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 <foreign xml:lang="grc">φόνοιο μητρυιη̃ς</foreign>, " murder by a stepmother,” i.e. Ino, who was <lb/>

            that built this ship and cut with brazen axe her timbers <lb/>
            about the peak of Pelion ; and with the goddess worked <lb/>
            Argus. But that ship of yours hath the angry wave riven <lb/>
            asunder, or ever she came nigh to the rocks which clash to­ <lb/>
            gether the livelong day in the sea's narrow channel. But <lb/>
            come now, even ye, and help us in our struggle to bring the <lb/>
            fleece of gold to Hellas, and be our pilots, for I am sent to <lb/>
            make full atonement for the attempted sacrifice1 of Phrixus, <lb/>
            that stirred the wrath of Zeus against the sons of Æolus.”</p>
          <p>So spake he to comfort them, but they would none of it <lb/>
            when they heard; for they thought they would find Æetes <lb/>
            no gentle host, if they desired to take the ram's fleece. <lb/>
            Thus spake Argus, sore vexed that they were bent on such <lb/>
            a quest, " My friends, the strength that is in us shall never <lb/>
            be withheld from helping you, no, not one jot, when any <lb/>
            need arise. But terribly is Æetes furnished with deadly <lb/>
            cruelty. Wherefore I do greatly fear to voyage thither. <lb/>
            He avows him2 to be the son of Hellos, and around him <lb/>
            dwell countless tribes of Colchians, and he might match <lb/>
            even with Ares his dread war cry and mighty strength. <lb/>
            Yea, and 'twere no easy task to take the fleece away from <lb/>
            Æetes ; so huge a serpent keepeth guard around and about <lb/>
            it, a deathless, sleepless snake, which earth herself did rear <lb/>
            in the wolds of Caucasus, by the rock of Typhon, where <lb/>
            they say Typhon, smitten by the bolt of Zeus, the son of <lb/>
            Cronos, what time he stretched out his strong hands against <lb/>
            him, did drop warm gore from his head ; and he came with <lb/>
            this wound to the mountains and plain of Nysa; where to this <lb/>

          <p><note type="correspondsTo" n="[BOOK II."/>So spake he; and o'er the cheek of many did paleness <lb/>
            spread at once, when they heard the greatness of their <lb/>
            labour. But Peleus quickly answered and said, with brave <lb/>
            words, " Be not so exceeding fearful at heart, my trusty <lb/>
            friend.1 For we are not so wanting in valiancy, as to be no <lb/>
            match for a bout in arms with Æetes ; nay, methinks we <lb/>
            too came hither knowing somewhat of war, for we are near <lb/>
            in blood to the blessed gods. Wherefore if he give us not <lb/>
            the fleece of gold for love, I trow his tribes of Colchians <lb/>
            shall not much avail him."</p>
          <p>Thus did they hold converse together, until, satisfied <lb/>
            with food, they fell asleep. And when they woke at dawn, <lb/>
            a gentle breeze was blowing; so they set the sails, which <lb/>
            did strain before the rushing wind; and swiftly they left <lb/>
            the isle of Ares on the lee.</p>
          <p>On the following night they passed the isle of Philyra,2 <lb/>
            where Cronos, son of Uranus, lay with Philyra, having <lb/>
            deceived Rhea, when he ruled the Titans on Olympus, and <lb/>
            that other, Zeus, was yet being reared in a cave in Crete by <lb/>
            the Idæan Curetes; but the goddess caught them in the <lb/>
            midst of their dalliance; and he sprang up and sped away <lb/>
            in the semblance of a horse with flowing mane, but she, <lb/>
            that child of Oceanus, Philyra, left that country and those <lb/>
            haunts in shame, and came to the distant hills of the <lb/>
            Pelasgi, where she bare to him in return for his love huge <lb/>
            Chiron, half horse, half god in appearance.</p>
          <p>Thence they sailed on past the Macrones and the bound­ <lb/>

            Byzeræ next to them ; for ever onward they cleft their way <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὴθει̃ε</foreign>, mostly an address of respect by a younger man to an elder, <lb/>

            in haste, borne forward by the gentle wind. And as they <lb/>
            sailed, there came in sight a bay of the sea, and before <lb/>
            them rose up the steep cliffs of the Caucasian mountains, <lb/>
            where Prometheus was feeding with his liver an eagle. <lb/>
            swooping back again and again, his limbs fast bound to the <lb/>
            hard rocks with bands of brass, unbreakable; that eagle <lb/>
            did they see at eve skimming right above the ship with <lb/>
            loud rush of wings nigh to the clouds, and yet he made all <lb/>
            the sails to shake as he flapped his pinions. For he ha I <lb/>
            not the form of a bird of the air, but, when he moved his <lb/>
            swift feathers, they were like to polished oars. And no <lb/>
            long time after, they heard a bitter cry. as the liver of <lb/>
            Prometheus was torn, and the welkin rang with his sereams. <lb/>
            until again they marked the savage eagle soaring on his <lb/>
            way from the mountain; and at night, by the skill of <lb/>
            Argus, came they to the broad stream of the Phasis. and <lb/>
            the uttermost ends of the sea.</p>
          <p>Anon they furled and put away the sails and the yard­ <lb/>
            arm within the hollow mast-hold, and they let down the <lb/>
            mast too along the deck, and quickly rowed into the river's <lb/>
            broad current; and he dashed all round them. yet gave <lb/>
            way. Upon their left hand they kept steep Caucasus and <lb/>
            the Cytæan town of Æa, and next the plain of Ares and <lb/>
            that god's sacred grove, where the serpent keepeth watch <lb/>
            and ward o'er the fleece as it hangs on the oak's rough <lb/>
            branches. Then did the son of Æson with his own hand <lb/>
            pour a libation sweet as honey, of unmixed wine, from a <lb/>
            golden chalice into the river to Earth and the gods of that <lb/>
            land,1 and the spirits of heroes dead and gone ; and he be­ <lb/>
            sought them to be his kindly helpers graciously, and to <lb/>
            allow a fair anchoring of the ship. And forthwith Ancæus <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐνναέταις</foreign> = <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐγχωρίοις</foreign>, " gods of the country;” a precaution usual <lb/>

             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BOOK II., L. 1280-8."/><lb/>
            spake this word amongst them, “ Lo! we are come to the <lb/>

            make plans for ourselves, whether indeed we will try Æetes <lb/>
            with gentleness, or whether haply some different attempt <lb/>
            shall win the day."</p>
          <p>So spake he ; and Jason, by the advice of Argus, bade <lb/>
            them row the ship into a shaded backwater1 and let her ride <lb/>
            at anchor in deep water, and that they found close by; <lb/>

            OME now, Erato,1 stand at my side and tell, how Jason <lb/>
            brought the fleece hence to Iolchos by the love of <lb/>

          <p>Thus those chieftains abode in their ambush, unseen <lb/>
            among the thick reeds, and the goddesses, Hera and Athene, <lb/>
            were ware of them; so they came unto a chamber, apart <lb/>

            counsel together ; and first did Hera make trial of Athene : <lb/>
            " Do thou now first begin with thy plan, daughter of Zeus. <lb/>
            What is to be done ? wilt thou devise some crafty wile, <lb/>
            whereby they shall take the golden fleece from Æetes and <lb/>
            carry it to Hellas, or shall they haply persuade him with <lb/>
            gentle words and so prevail? For surely he is terribly <lb/>
            haughty. And yet it is not right that any attempt of ours <lb/>
            should be turned aside."</p>
          <p>So spake she; and Athene answered her at once : " I was <lb/>
            even pondering these very things myself, Hera, when thou <lb/>
            didst question me outright; but not yet, methinks, have I <note type="footnote"> 1 ’<foreign xml:lang="grc">Ερατώ</foreign>, the Muse of dancing. The name of this Muse at first sight <lb/>

            ’<foreign xml:lang="grc">Ερατώ, ἐπήρατον</foreign>. But as this third book is to relate Jason's wooing and <lb/>
            winning of Medea, there is a certain appropriateness in an address to <lb/>

            devised a plan to help those chieftains brave, though many <lb/>
            are the schemes my mind revolves."</p>
          <p>Therewith those goddesses fixed their eyes upon the <lb/>
            ground before them, pondering separately in their hearts. <lb/>
            Anon, when she had thought thus awhile, Hera broke the <lb/>
            silence: " Let us hence to Cypris ; and, when we are come, <lb/>
            let us both urge her to speak unto her boy, if haply he can <lb/>
            be persuaded to shoot an arrow at the daughter of JEetes, <lb/>
            mighty sorceress, and bewitch her with love of Jason. <lb/>
            For, methinks, he would by her helping counsel bear the <lb/>
            fleece to Hellas."</p>
          <p>So spake she; and her sage plan pleased Athene, and <lb/>
            once more she answered her with winning words: " Ah! <lb/>
            Hera, my sire begat me to know nought of the darts of <lb/>
            love, nor wot I of any magic spell of desire. But if this <lb/>
            word pleaseth thee thyself, surely I will follow; but thou <lb/>
            must speak when thou comest before her."</p>
          <p>Therewith went they darting to the great house of Cypris, <lb/>
            the house which her lord of the strong arms had builded <lb/>
            for her, when first he brought her from Zeus to be his <lb/>
            bride. So they entered the courtyard and stood beneath <lb/>
            the corridor that led to her chamber, where the goddess <lb/>
            used to make ready the couch of Hephaestus. But he had <lb/>
            gone to his smithy 1 and anvils at dawn, a cavern vast <lb/>
            within a floating island, wherein he would forge all manner <lb/>
            of cunning work with the blast of fire; so she was sit­ <lb/>
            ting alone in her house on her rounded chair, facing the <lb/>
            door, and she was combing her hair with a golden comb, <lb/>
            letting it cover her white shoulders on either side, and she <lb/>
            was in the act of plaiting her long tresses when she saw them <lb/>
            before her, and stopped; and she bade them enter, and <lb/>
            arose from her throne and made them sit on seats; then <lb/>
            sat she down herself and bound up her uncombed hair <note type="footnote"> 1 Hephæstus’ forge was said to be in Lipara, one of the isles of .EOIs, <lb/>
            not far from Sicily. </note> <lb/>

             <note type="correspondsTo" n="L. 20-76.]"/><lb/>
            with her two hands. And thus with a smile she spake to <lb/>
            them in wheedling words, " Fair ladies, what purpose or <lb/>
            business doth bring you hither after so long a time ? and <lb/>
            why are ye twain come that came not very often aforetime <lb/>
            to visit me ? for ye are far above all other goddesses."</p>
          <p>Thus then did Hera answer her in turn: " Thou dost <lb/>
            mock us ; but the heart of us twain is stirred by sore mis­ <lb/>
            chance. For even now in the river Phasis the son of Æson <lb/>
            stays his ship, and those others who come with him to <lb/>
            fetch the fleece. Verily for them all do we fear exceedingly, <lb/>
            since their work is nigh, but most of all for the son of <lb/>
            Æson. Him will I save, though he sail even to Hades, to <lb/>
            free Ixion 1 there below from his fetters of brass, so far as <lb/>
            there is any strength in my limbs, that Pelias may not <lb/>
            mock if he escape his evil doom; he who in his haughtiness <lb/>
            left me without my meed of sacrifice. Yea, and, beyond all <lb/>
            that, Jason was ever dear to me aforetime, from that day <lb/>
            when he met me at the mouth of the swollen Anaurus, as <lb/>
            he came up from hunting, and I did test the righteousness <lb/>
            of men; and all the hills and towering crags were coated <lb/>
            with snow, and their torrents came rushing down from <lb/>
            them with loud roar. But he had compassion on me in <lb/>
            the likeness of an old bag, and took me up upon his <lb/>
            shoulders and bore me through the headlong flood. Where­ <lb/>
            fore he hath honour of me unceasingly, nor shall Pelias <lb/>
            work outrage upon him, even though thou grant him not <lb/>
            his return."</p>
          <p>So spake she; but speechlessness seized Cypris. For she <note type="footnote"> 1 Ixion was bound to an ever-turning wheel by Zeus because he had in­ <lb/>
            suIted Hera. " Even him," says Hera, " I would release if Jason required <lb/>
            it, for I remember how he showed kindness to me on the day I made <lb/>
            trial of men's hearts." Hera had assumed the form of an old woman, <lb/>
            in which guise Jason had found her on the banks of the swollen <lb/>
            torrent Anaurus; and when she would go over but dare not, Jason <lb/>
            carried her across upon his shoulders, and knew not that it was the <lb/>
            goddess. </note> <pb n="102"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BOOK III."/><lb/>
            was awe-struck at seeing Hera ask a favour of her, and <lb/>
            she answered her with kindly words, " Dread goddess, may <lb/>
            nought worse than Cypris 1 ever come to thee, if I neglect <lb/>
            thy desire in word or deed, so far as these weak hands can <lb/>
            effect aught; and let me have no thanks in return."</p>
          <p>So spake she ; and Hera once again made prudent speech: <lb/>
            " We come not to thee through lack of might or strength <lb/>
            at all. But, as thou eanst, softly bid thy boy bewitch the <lb/>
            daughter of Æetes2 with passion for the son of Æson. For <lb/>
            if she do help him with friendly counsel, lightly, I trow, <lb/>
            will he take the golden fleece and return to Iolehos ; for she <lb/>
            is very crafty."</p>
          <p>So spake she; and Cypris said unto them both, " Hera, <lb/>
            and Athene, he will obey you rather than me. For shame­ <lb/>
            less as he is, haply will he have some little reverence at <lb/>
            sight of you, but me he regardeth not, but ever and aye he <lb/>
            slighteth me, and striveth with me. And lo! overcome by <lb/>
            his naughtiness, I have a mind to break his bow and ill­ <lb/>
            sounding arrows before his eyes ; for in a burst of anger he <lb/>
            threatened me on this wise, that if I would not keep my <lb/>
            hands off him, whilst he was mastering his temper, I would <lb/>
            have only myself to blame hereafter."</p>
          <p>So spake she ; and the goddesses smiled, and looked at <lb/>
            one another; but Cypris answered with a sigh, Others can <lb/>
            laugh at my sorrows, nor ought I to tell them to every <lb/>
            one; enough that my own heart knows them. But now <lb/>
            since this is the will of both of you, I will try and coax <lb/>
            him, nor will he disobey."</p>
          <p>So spake she; and Hera stroked her dainty hand, and <lb/>
            with a soft smile spake to her in answer, " Yes, even so <lb/>
            accomplish this business now at once, as thou sayest, 0 <note type="footnote"> I i.e. may all of whom you make requests be as easy to persuade as <lb/>

            Cytherea, and distress not thyself at all, nor wrathfully strive <lb/>
            with thy child, for he shall cease tormenting thee hereafter."</p>
          <p>Therewith she left her seat, and Athene went with her. <lb/>
            So they twain went back again, and Cypris too went on her <lb/>
            way through the wolds of Olympus, to see if she could find <lb/>
            her son. And she found him far away in a blooming <lb/>
            orchard of Zeus, not alone, but Ganymede was with him; <lb/>
            he it was whom Zeus on a day brought to dwell in heaven <lb/>
            with the immortals, eager for his beauty. And those <lb/>
            twain were sporting with golden dice, as youths alike in <lb/>
            habits will. Now the one, even greedy Eros, held the palm <lb/>
            of his left hand quite full already beneath his breast as he <lb/>
            stood there upright; and a sweet blush was mantling. on <lb/>
            the skin of his cheeks ; but the other sat crouching near in <lb/>
            moody silence, and he held two dice, casting one forth upon <lb/>
            the other, where he sat, and he was angered at the loud <lb/>
            laughter of Eros. Now when he had lost these at once as <lb/>
            well as the first, away he went with empty hands, helpless, <lb/>
            and he was not ware of Cypris as she drew nigh ; so she <lb/>
            stood facing her child, and at once, laying her hand upon <lb/>
            his mouth, she spake to him: " Thou monstrous rogue, why <lb/>
            laughest thou ? surely thou didst cheat him, poor dupe, at <lb/>
            that game, and thou didst not fairly get the better of him <lb/>
            But come now, accomplish readily the business I shall tell <lb/>
            thee of, and verily I will give thee that fair plaything, <lb/>
            which his fond nurse, Adresteia, made for Zeus, in the <lb/>
            cave of Ida, while he was yet a little child, a ball well­ <lb/>
            rounded, than which thou canst get no fairer toy from the <lb/>
            hands of Hephæstus. Of gold are his circles fashioned,1 <note type="footnote"> 1 The description of the ball is rather puzzling on account of the <lb/>
            numerous allusions to the seams in it. <foreign xml:lang="grc">κύκα</foreign> = the pieces of which the <lb/>

            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ῥαφαί</foreign> are the stitches of these fastenings; while over and around all the <lb/>
            fastenings runs a spiral (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἕλιξ</foreign>) of blue, not as a fastening, but as an orna­ <lb/>
            ment to the whole work. </note> <pb n="104"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BOOK III."/><lb/>
            and round each runneth a double fastening, holding them <lb/>
            together, but the seams thereof are hidden, for a blue <lb/>
            spiral runneth over them all. And if thou toss it in thy <lb/>
            hands, it sends a track of flame through the air, like a star. <lb/>
            Yea, this will I give thee, but do thou shoot at the daughter <lb/>
            of Æetes and bewitch her with love for Jason, and let <lb/>
            there be no delay, for then would the gratitude be <lb/>
            fainter."</p>
          <p>So spake she; and 'twas a welcome word to him when <lb/>
            he heard. Down he threw all his toys, and caught hold of <lb/>
            the goddess's robe with both hands eagerly on either side. <lb/>
            And he besought her instantly to give it him at once; but <lb/>
            she met him with gentle words, and drew his cheek to hers <lb/>
            and put her arms round him and kissed him, answering : <lb/>
            " Be witness1 now thine own darling head and mine, that I <lb/>
            will surely give it thee, and will not deceive thee, if thou <lb/>
            fix thy shaft in the heart of the daughter of Æetes.”</p>
          <p>Thus she ; and he gathered his dice together, and, after <lb/>
            counting them all carefully, cast them into the fold of his <lb/>
            mother's bright robe. Next he slung about him with a <lb/>
            belt of gold his quiver, which was hanging on a tree­ <lb/>
            trunk, and he took up his bended bow, and went on his <lb/>
            way from the halls of Zeus through the fruitful orchard. <lb/>
            Then came he forth from the heavenly gates of Olympus, <lb/>
            where is a path down from heaven; for the world's two <lb/>
            poles, the highest points on earth, whereon the sun at his <lb/>
            rising rests with his earliest rays, uphold steep mountain- <lb/>
            tops ; while below, on the one side, Earth, the life-giver, <lb/>
            and the cities of men, and sacred river-streams, and, on <lb/>
            the other, hills and sea all round appeared to him, as he <lb/>
            passed through the wide upper air.</p>
          <p>Now the heroes sat in council on the ship's benches, in <lb/>
            their ambush apart, in a backwater of the river. And <note type="footnote"> I i.e. I swear by myself and by the love I bear you. </note> <pb n="105"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="L. 138-196.]"/><lb/>
            amongst them the soil of Æson himself was speaking, <lb/>
            while they, sitting quietly in their place in order, did listen: <lb/>
            " My friends, surely I will tell you what seems good to me <lb/>
            myself; but 'tis for you to bring it to pass. For all alike <lb/>
            share this quest, and all alike can speak; and he who <lb/>
            silently withholds his purpose and counsel, let him know, <lb/>
            that 'tis he and he alone who robbeth this expedition of its <lb/>
            return. Do ye others abide here quietly in the ship with <lb/>
            your arms ; but I will go to the halls of Æetes, taking the <lb/>
            sons of Phrixus and two comrades as well. And when I <lb/>
            meet him, I will first see what words may do, whether he <lb/>
            be willing to give us the golden fleece for love, or, if 1 he <lb/>
            will not, but, trusting to his might, will not heed our <lb/>
            quest. For thus of himself shall we learn his ill-will afore <lb/>
            and devise, whether to meet him in the field, or whether <lb/>
            there shall be some other plan to help us, if we restrain our <lb/>
            battle-cry. But let us not deprive him of his possession <lb/>
            thus by force, till we have tried what words can do. Nay, <lb/>
            'twere better first to go and conciliate him with words. <lb/>
            Full oft, I wis, hath a word easily accomplished at need, <lb/>
            what might would scarce have won, in that it seemed <lb/>
            soothing. Yea, and this man too once welcomed gallant2 <lb/>

          <p>So spake he; and forthwith the young men agreed to the <lb/>
            word of the son of Æson, and there was not one who could <lb/>

            Phrixus and Telamon and Augeas to go with him; and in <lb/>
            his hand he took the wand of Hermes;1 and anon forth <lb/>
            they went from the ship, beyond the reeds and water, <lb/>
            toward the country over a rising plain. This, they say, is <lb/>
            called the plain of Circe, and on it were growing in rows <lb/>
            many willows and osiers,2 on whose branches hang dead <lb/>
            men, bound with cords. For to this day 'tis an abomina­ <lb/>
            tion to Colchians to burn the corpses of men with fire; <lb/>
            nor is it lawful to lay them in the earth, and heap a cairn <lb/>
            above them; but two3 men must roll them up in hides un­ <lb/>
            tanned, and fasten them to trees afar from the town. And <lb/>
            yet the earth getteth an equal share with the air, for they <lb/>

          <p>Now as the heroes went through the city, Hera, with <lb/>
            friendly intent, shed a thick mist on them, that they might <lb/>

            the city and house of Æetes, then again did Hera disperse <lb/>
            the cloud. And they stood at the entrance, astonied at the <lb/>
            king's fenced walls and wide gates and columns, which <lb/>
            stood in rows upholding the walls ; and above the house <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">σκη̃πτρον</foreign> ’<foreign xml:lang="grc">Ερμείαο</foreign>. This wand had been entrusted in the outset to <lb/>

            was a coping of stone resting upon triglyplis 1 of bronze. <lb/>
            Then went they quietly over the threshold. And nigh <lb/>
            thereto were garden-vines in full blossom, shooting on <lb/>
            high, and covered with green young foliage. Beneath <lb/>
            them flowed those four eternal springs, which Hephæstus <lb/>
            digged, whereof the one did gush with milk, another with <lb/>
            wine, while a third flowed with fragrant unguents, and the <lb/>
            last gave a stream of water, which was warm at the setting <lb/>
            of the Pleiads, and in turn at their rising spouted up cold <lb/>
            as ice from the hollow rock. These were the wondrous <lb/>
            works that crafty Hephæstus did devise in the halls of <lb/>
            Cytæan Æetes. And he fashioned for him bulls with <lb/>
            brazen feet, and mouths of brass, wherefrom they breathed <lb/>
            the fearful blaze of fire; yea, and he forged for him <lb/>
            besides a plough of stout adamant, all of one piece, in re­ <lb/>
            turn for the kindness of Helios,2 for he had taken him up <lb/>
            in his chariot, when he was weary at the battle on Phlegra's <lb/>
            plain.</p>
          <p>Next was builded the inner court; and in the walls <lb/>
            thereof on either side were close-folding doors and rooms ; <lb/>
            and all along both walls ran a corridor of carved work; <lb/>
            and across at either end stood higher buildings ; in one of <lb/>
            these, which towered over all, dwelt king Æetes with his <lb/>
            wife, and in the other lived Absyrtus,3 son of Æetes, whom <lb/>
            Asterodia, nymph of Caucasus, bare, ere that Eidyia be­ <lb/>
            came his wedded wife, last-born child of Tethys and <lb/>
            Oceanus ; him the sons of the Colchians did call by the <lb/>
            name of Phaethon, for he outshone all the young men. <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">γλύφιδες</foreign>, properly “ the notch of an arrow " which fits on the string, <lb/>

            But the servants and the two daughters of Æetes, Chal­ <lb/>
            ciope1 and Medea, had the other rooms. Now they found <lb/>
            Medea going from chamber to chamber in quest of her <lb/>
            sister; for Hera had kept her at home, though aforetime <lb/>
            she came not very often into the house, but all day long <lb/>
            was busied at the temple of Hecate, for 'twas she that <lb/>
            was priestess of the goddess. And when she saw them <lb/>
            near, she cried out, and quickly did Chalciope hear, and <lb/>
            the maid-servants threw down at their feet their yarn and <lb/>
            thread, and came running out all together. But Chalciope, <lb/>
            when she saw her sons with those others, lifted up her <lb/>
            hands for joy, and so too did they greet their mother, and <lb/>
            embraced her for joy when they saw her. And thus spake <lb/>
            she through her sobs : " So then, after all, ye were not to <lb/>
            wander very far, leaving me in my anguish2; but fate <lb/>
            hath turned you back. Ah! woe is me ! what a desire for <lb/>
            Hellas did ye feel, prompted by some pitiful infatuation, <lb/>
            at the bidding of your father Phrixus! who dying did <lb/>
            ordain bitter sorrow for my heart. Why should ye go to <lb/>
            the city of Orchomenus, whoever this Orchomenus is,3 for <lb/>
            the sake of the goods of Athamas, leaving your mother <lb/>
            behind in her sorrow ? "</p>
          <p>So spake she; and last of all came Æetes forth to the <lb/>
            door, and forth came Eidyia in person, wife of Æetes, when <lb/>
            she heard Chalciope ; and anon that whole courtyard was <lb/>
            filled with a throng. Thralls in crowds were busy now, <note type="footnote"> 1 Elder daughter of Æetes, sister of Medea ; she had been married to <lb/>

            wood with the axe, and others were heating at the fire <lb/>

            in obedience to the king.</p>
          <p>Meantime Eros went through the clear air unseen, con­ <lb/>
            fusing them, as when the gad-fly ariseth against grazing <lb/>
            heifers, the fly which herdsmen call the goad of cattle. <lb/>
            Quickly within the porch, beneath the lintel, he stretched <lb/>
            his bow and drew from his quiver a shaft of sorrow never <lb/>
            yet used. Then did he pass unseen across the threshold <lb/>
            with hasty steps, glancing quickly round, and gliding close <lb/>
            past the son of Æson himself, he laid the notch of the <lb/>
            arrow on the middle of the bow-string, and drawing1 it to <lb/>
            the head with both hands he let it fly straight against <lb/>
            Medea; and speechless amaze took hold upon her. But <lb/>
            lie sped away again from the high-roofed hall, laughing <lb/>
            loudly. And the shaft burnt beneath the maiden's heart, <lb/>
            like a flame, and ever she kept darting glances toward the <lb/>
            son of Æson, and her heart was wildly beating in her <lb/>
            breast in distress, and she remembered nought but him, <lb/>
            and her soul was melting with sweet sorrow. As when <lb/>
            some poor workwoman hath strewn dry chips about a <lb/>
            blazing brand-one whose business is to spin wool-that <lb/>
            she may make a blaze at night beneath her roof, waking <lb/>
            exceeding early; which darting up wondrously from the <lb/>
            tiny brand doth consume all the chips with itself ; even so <lb/>
            love in his mighty couched beneath her heart, was burning <lb/>
            secretly; and her soft cheeks would pale and blush by <lb/>
            turns, in the anguish of her soul.</p>

            and they had washed themselves in warm baths, gladly <lb/>
            did they take their fill of food and drink. Then did <lb/>
            Æetes question the sons of his daughter, addressing them <lb/>
            with these words: " Sons of my daughter and of Phrixus, <lb/>
            whom I honoured above all strangers in our halls, how <lb/>
            came ye back again to Æa ? did some misfortune come be­ <lb/>
            twixt you and your safety, preventing you ? Ye hearkened <lb/>
            not to me when I set before you the measure of the voyage. <lb/>
            For I knew it that day I whirled along in the car of Helios, <lb/>
            my father, when he was bringing my sister Circe into the <lb/>
            land of the west,1 and we came to a headland of the Tyr­ <lb/>
            senian mainland, where she dwelleth even now, very far <lb/>
            from the Colchian land. What pleasure, though, have I in <lb/>
            telling hereof ? Come tell me plainly what befell you, or <lb/>
            who these are who bear you company, and whence ye have <lb/>
            come from your hollow ship."</p>
          <p>Somewhat afeard was Argus for the expedition of the <lb/>
            son of Æson when he questioned so straitly, but he <lb/>
            before his brethren made a gentle answer, for he was the <lb/>
            eldest: " Æetes, that ship of ours did raging winds soon <lb/>
            wreck; but the wave cast us up, as we crouched on <lb/>
            timbers, on the dry land of the isle of Enyalius, in the <lb/>
            dead of night, for some god saved us. For not even were <lb/>
            the birds of Ares roosting on that desert isle, which were <lb/>
            there aforetime, nor did we find them any more. But <lb/>
            these men had driven them away, when they came forth <lb/>
            from their ship on the previous day, and the mind of <lb/>
            Zeus or some chance kept them there, in pity for us ; for <lb/>
            at once they gave us food and raiment in plenty, after <lb/>
            hearing the famous name of Phrixus and of thee thyself, <lb/>
            for to thy city were they faring. If thou wouldst surely <lb/>
            know their business, I will not hide it from thee. A <lb/>

            country and his goods, for that he excelled very greatly in <lb/>
            his might all the sons of Æolus, is sending him hither on <lb/>
            a difficult voyage; for it is ordained that the race of <lb/>
            Æolus shall not escape the grievous wrath and fury of <lb/>
            implacable Zeus, nor the awful pollution and the punish­ <lb/>
            ment for the sake of Phrixus, until the fleece come to Hellas. <lb/>
            And Pallas Athene hath builded his ship, in no wise like the <lb/>
            ships amongst the Colchian folk, whereof we chanced <lb/>
            upon the vilest; 1 for furious winds and waves tore it in <lb/>
            pieces enow. But that other holds fast unto her bolts, even <lb/>
            though all the winds fall heavy on her. And swift as the <lb/>
            wind she speeds, whenso her crew bend to their oars with <lb/>
            a will. And Jason hath gathered together in her the <lb/>
            chosen heroes from all Achæa, and is come to thy city, <lb/>
            after wandering to many towns, and over the face of the <lb/>
            loathly sea, to see if thou wilt give him the fleece. And as <lb/>
            it is pleasing to thee, so shall it be; for he is not come to <lb/>
            use violence, but 'tis his desire to pay thee fair quittance <lb/>
            for the gift; for he heareth from me that the Sauromatæ <lb/>
            are thy grievous foes ; so he will subdue these to thy rule. <lb/>
            And if, as thou sayest, thou art anxious to know too their <lb/>
            name and lineage, who they be, verily let me tell thee all. <lb/>
            Him, for sake of whom the rest mustered from Hellas, men <lb/>
            call Jason, son of Æson, whom Cretheus begat. Now if he <lb/>
            is really of the stock of Cretheus himself, so must he be a <lb/>
            kinsman on his father's side to us. For both Cretheus <lb/>
            and Athamas were sons of Æolus; and Phrixus again was <lb/>
            son of Athamas, who was son of Æolus. Lo! here dost <lb/>
            thou see Augeas, if ever thou dost hear of this son of <lb/>
            Helios, and this is Telamon, sprung from famous Æacus, <lb/>
            whom Zeus himself begat. So too all the rest, who follow <lb/>
            in his crew, are sons or scions of immortal gods."</p>
          <p>This was the tale that Argus told. And the king was <note type="footnote"> I Æetes had given the sons of Chalciope a bad ship in the hope of <lb/>

             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BOOK III."/><lb/>
            angered at his word, as he listened. And his heart swelled <lb/>
            high with rage, and he spake with a troubled mind, but <lb/>
            most of all was he wroth with the sons of Chalciope, <lb/>
            for he thought that Jason had come on this quest by <lb/>
            reason of them ; and his eyes flashed beneath his brows <lb/>
            in his fury : " Away, ye caitiff wretches, at once from my <lb/>
            sight; depart from my land with your trickery, ere some <lb/>
            of you see the fleece and Phrixus to your sorrow. 'Twas <lb/>
            not to fetch the fleece, but to take my sceptre and my <lb/>
            kingly power, that ye banded together and came hither at <lb/>
            once from Hellas. But if ye had not tasted first of my <lb/>
            board, of a truth I would have cut out your tongues and <lb/>
            chopped off both your hands and sent you forth with feet <lb/>
            alone, that ye might be stayed from setting forth there­ <lb/>
            after ; what lies too have ye told about the blessed gods!”</p>
          <p>So spake he in his fury; and mightily was the heart of <lb/>
            the son of Æacus swelling in his breast; and his spirit <lb/>
            within him longed to give him back a fatal answer,1 but the <lb/>
            son of Æson checked him; and, before he could speak, <lb/>
            himself made gentle answer: " Æetes, bear with me anent <lb/>
            this my coming. For we are in no wise come unto thy <lb/>
            town and home, as thou belike dost think, nor with any <lb/>
            such desire. For who would willingly venture to cross so <lb/>
            wide a gulf for the goods of another ? Nay, 'twas a god <lb/>
            and the chilling best of a presumptuous king that sent us <lb/>
            forth. Grant thy favour to our prayer; and I will carry <lb/>
            throughout Hellas a wondrous report of thee; yea, and we <lb/>
            are ready even now to make thee quick recompense in thy <lb/>
            wars, if haply thou desirest to bring beneath thy sway even <lb/>
            the Sauromatæ or some other folk."</p>
          <p>So spake he, trying to win him with gentle speech. But <lb/>
            that other's heart was pondering a double design, either to <lb/>
            set upon them and slay them out of hand, or, strong king as <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὀλοόν ἔπος</foreign>, i.e. an answer that would have had deadly consequences <lb/>
            to someone. </note> <pb n="113"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="L. 368-430.]"/><lb/>
            he was, to make trial of their might. And as he thought <lb/>
            thereon, this seemed the better plan ; and so he caught <lb/>
            him up and said, " Stranger, why shouldst thou tell me all <lb/>
            to the end ? For if ye are really of the race of gods, or <lb/>
            have set foot upon a foreign shore no ways my inferiors, <lb/>
            I will give thee the golden fleece to carry hence, if so thou <lb/>
            wilt, after trying thee. For in the case of good men I grudge <lb/>
            it noways, as yourselves declare he doth who is king in Hellas. <lb/>
            But to test your spirit and strength there shall be a task, <lb/>
            which I myself can compass with my hands, hard though <lb/>
            it be. Two bulls with brazen hoofs, breathing flame from <lb/>
            their mouths, do browse upon yon plain of Ares ; these do <lb/>
            I yoke and drive over the rough fallow of Ares of four <lb/>
            plough-gates, and when I have speedily turned it up with <lb/>
            the plough to the end I sow for seed in the furrows, not <lb/>
            the corn of Demeter, but the teeth of a dread serpent, <lb/>
            which grow into the form 1 of armed men. These do I next <lb/>
            utterly destroy with my spear as they stand round to meet <lb/>
            me. At early dawn I yoke my oxen, and at eventide I <lb/>
            cease from my harvesting.</p>
          <p>" Now, if thou wilt accomplish the like, thou shalt bear <lb/>
            away to the king's palace the fleece upon the self-same <lb/>
            day. Ere that I will not give it thee; so hope not so. <lb/>
            For it were shameful indeed for a good man born to yield <lb/>
            unto a worse."</p>
          <p>So spake he ; but Jason fixed his eyes in front of him <lb/>
            and sat speechless, as he was, at a sore loss. Long time <lb/>
            turned he the plan over, and no way could he find to <lb/>
            accept the challenge courageously, for the task seemed a <lb/>
            great one; but at last he made answer with crafty words : <lb/>
            " ްÆetes, very straitly dost thou shut me up within thy <lb/>
            right. Wherefore I will even endure that toil, passing <lb/>
            hard though it be; yea, though it be my lot to die. For <lb/>
            there is nothing worse that cometh on men than dire neces- <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">δέμας</foreign> used adverbially = " in form, appearance." </note> <note type="footnote"> I </note> <pb n="114"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BOOK III."/><lb/>
            sity, and 'twas it that forced me to come hither at the <lb/>
            king’s command."</p>
          <p>So spake he, smitten with dismay; and the other answered <lb/>
            him in his distress with grim words: " Come now unto <lb/>
            the gathering,1 since thou art even eager for the toil; but if <lb/>
            thou art afraid to put the yoke upon the oxen's neck, or <lb/>
            if haply thou shrink from the deadly harvesting, these <lb/>
            things severally shall be my care, that so any other may <lb/>
            fear to come to a man that is better than he."2</p>
          <p>So spake he bluntly; but the other, even Jason, leapt <lb/>
            up from his seat, and Augeas and Telamon by his side, but <lb/>
            only Argus 3 went with him, for he signed to his brothers, <lb/>
            whilst they were yet there, that they should stay behind. <lb/>
            But they went forth from the hall. And the son of Æson <lb/>
            shone out wondrously amongst them all for beauty and <lb/>
            grace, and the maiden cast shy glances at him, holding her <lb/>
            bright veil aside, consuming her heart with woe ; and her <lb/>
            thoughts stole after him like a dream,4 and flitted in his <lb/>
            footsteps as he went. So they went forth from the house, <lb/>
            sore at heart. And Chalciope, avoiding the wrath of <lb/>
            Æetes, had gone swiftly to her chamber with her sons. <lb/>
            And in like manner came Medea after her; and much she <lb/>
            brooded in her heart, even all the cares that love doth <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">μεθ</foreign>’ <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὄμιμον</foreign>, “to the place of gathering," <foreign xml:lang="grc">μετα</foreign> = <foreign xml:lang="grc">προς</foreign>. This usage <lb/>
            is very common in Apollonius. The phrase might also mean " come <lb/>
            after the crowd," but. that suits the context less well, for the crowd <lb/>

            hazard so dangerous an enterprise. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 i.e. a dark threat of punishment for Jason's presumption in pre­ <lb/>

            urge. For before her eyes everything yet seemed to be, <lb/>
            her lover's very form, the raiment that he wore, the words <lb/>
            he said, the way he sat upon his seat, and how he went <lb/>
            unto the door; and, as she thought thereon, she dreamed <lb/>
            there never was such another man ; and ever in her ears <lb/>
            his voice was ringing and the sweet words he spake. And <lb/>
            she feared for him, that the oxen or haply Æetes with his <lb/>
            own hands might slay him ; and she mourned for him <lb/>
            as though he were already slain outright, and the tears ran <lb/>
            softly down her cheeks in her affliction from her exceeding <lb/>
            pity; and, softly weeping, she uttered her voice aloud:- <lb/>
            Why doth this sorrow come o'er me to my grief? <lb/>
            Whether he be the best or worst of heroes that is now to <lb/>
            perish, let him die. Ah ! would that he might escape <lb/>
            unhurt. Yea, let that even come to pass, 0 dread goddess, <lb/>
            daughter of Perses 1; let him escape death and return <lb/>
            home. But if 'tis fated that he be slain by the oxen, let <lb/>
            him learn ere his doom, that I at least exult not in his <lb/>
            cruel fate."</p>
          <p>Even thus was that maiden weighed down with care. <lb/>
            Now when those others had gone outside the crowd and <lb/>
            the city along the path, which aforetime they had taken <lb/>
            from the plain; in that hour did Argus speak to Jason <lb/>
            with these words, " Son of Æson, thou wilt scorn the <lb/>
            counsel I shall tell thee 2 ; and yet it is not right at all to <lb/>
            desist from any attempt in trouble. Haply thou too hast <lb/>
            somewhat heard before that one of my sisters useth sorcery <lb/>
            by the prompting of Hecate, daughter of Perses ; if we can <lb/>
            persuade her, no longer, methinks, shall there be any fear <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Περσηί</foreign>, another name of Hecate, the goddess to whom Medea as a <lb/>
            sorceress naturally prays; she was so called as being a daughter of <lb/>
            Perses, or Persæus, though other legends declare her to have sprung <lb/>
            from Zeus. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 i.e. you may not think much of my counsel in this particular case, <lb/>
            but I give it all the same, for one ought to neglect no precaution in <lb/>

            that thou be foiled in thy emprise ; but terribly I fear,1 that <lb/>
            my mother will not undertake this for me. Yet will I go to <lb/>
            her again to entreat her ; for o'er the heads of all of us <lb/>
            hangeth joint destruction."</p>
          <p>So spake he in kindliness, and the other thus made <lb/>
            answer: " Good friend, if now this finds favour in thine <lb/>
            own eyes, I have nought against it. Speed thee then and <lb/>
            hasten to implore thy mother with words of wisdom. Yet <lb/>
            wretched indeed is our hope, when we have entrusted our <lb/>
            return to women."</p>
          <p>So spake he ; and quickly they came unto the backwater. <lb/>
            And their comrades questioned them with joy when they <lb/>
            saw them drawing near. But sorrowfully did the son of <lb/>
            Æson tell out his tale to them, " Friends, the heart of <lb/>
            cruel Æetes is angered at us outright. For never will the <lb/>
            goal be reached by me, nor yet by you who question me <lb/>
            on every point. Now he saith there are two bulls, with <lb/>
            hoofs of bronze, that range the plain of Ares, breathing <lb/>
            flame from their mouths. And he bath bidden me plough <lb/>
            with these a fallow-field of four plough-gates; then, he <lb/>
            says he will give me seed of the jaws of a serpent, which <lb/>
            maketh earth-born men to rise in their bronze harness, <lb/>
            and on that very day must I slay them. Which thing I <lb/>
            did promise him outright, for no better plan could I <lb/>
            devise."</p>
          <p>So spake he, and it seemed to them all a toil not to be <lb/>
            accomplished; long time looked they on one another in <lb/>
            speechless silence, bowed down with anguish and dismay <lb/>
            but at the last spake Peleus bravely amongst all the chief­ <lb/>
            tains : " 'Tis time to devise what we are to do. I deem <lb/>
            there is not so much help in counsel as in strong arms. <lb/>
            If then, hero son of Æson, thou art minded thyself to yoke <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">δείδω μὴ ὀυ</foreign> = Lat. vereor ne non = vereor ut. <foreign xml:lang="grc">τόγε</foreign>, the service in <lb/>
            question, i.e. the enlistment of the sympathies of Medea for the enter­ <lb/>
            prise by Chalciope. </note> <pb n="117"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="L. 480-537.]"/><lb/>
            the oxen of Æetes, and art eager for the labour, lo ! keep <lb/>
            now thy promise and make thee ready; but if thy spirit <lb/>
            hath no sure trust in thy valiancy, hasten not thyself, <lb/>
            nor sitting here look round for some other amongst these <lb/>
            men. For I myself will not hold back, for the worst grief <lb/>
            that can come will be but death."</p>
          <p>So spake the son of Æacus ; and the spirit of Telamon <lb/>
            was stirred ; and he sprang up in hot haste, and with him <lb/>
            uprose Idas in his pride, and the two sons of Tyndarus as <lb/>
            well; and with them the son of (Eneus, ranked among <lb/>
            men of prowess,1 albeit the soft down scarce showed upon <lb/>
            his face; so high rose the courage of his heart. But those <lb/>
            others gave way and kept silence. And anon spake Argus <lb/>
            this word to them in their eagerness for the enterprise, <lb/>
            " My friends, lo! this is left us at the last.2 But, methinks, <lb/>
            there shall come to us from my mother a very present <lb/>
            help. Wherefore, for all your eagerness, restrain your­ <lb/>
            selves a little space in the ship, as heretofore ; for 'tis <lb/>
            better to hold back withal than recklessly to choose an <lb/>
            evil doom. There dwells a maid in Æetes’ halls, whom <lb/>
            Hecate hath taught exceeding skill in all simples, that the <lb/>
            land and flowing water do produce. By them is quenched <lb/>
            even the blast of tireless flame ; and in a moment she stays <lb/>
            the rush of roaring streams, and she can bind the stars <lb/>
            and the courses of the holy moon. Of her we bethought <lb/>
            us as we came hither along the path from the house, if <lb/>
            haply our mother, own sister to her, can persuade her to <lb/>
            aid our labour. Now if this finds favour in your sight too, <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀίζηος</foreign> literally = " a vigorous, lusty man," then any man who has <lb/>
            come to his full strength, in which latter sense it is often employed by <lb/>
            Homer, though probably the idea of " manliness " ought in every case <lb/>
            to be kept prominent. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 " This is left us at the last," i.e. if we can find no better way, we <lb/>
            will do and die in the attempt if necessary ; but, ere that, let us employ <lb/>
            all the means that offer, and despise no plan of escape, even if it do pro­ <lb/>
            ceed from a woman. </note> <pb n="118"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BOOK III."/><lb/>
            verily I will go this very day back to the house of Æetes <lb/>
            to make essay; and perhaps some god will be with me in <lb/>
            my attempt."</p>
          <p>So spake he ; and the gods of their good will gave unto <lb/>
            them a sign. A trembling dove, flying from a strong <lb/>
            hawk, came down and settled in her terror in the bosom of <lb/>
            the son of Æson ; but the hawk transfixed1 himself upon <lb/>
            the pointed stern. At once Mopsus took up his parable <lb/>
            and spake this word amongst them all, " My friends, here <lb/>
            is a sign for you by the will of the gods ; no otherwise could <lb/>
            they more clearly bid us go speak with the maiden and <lb/>
            seek to her with all our skill. And methinks she will not <lb/>
            slight us, if, that is, Phineus said truly, that our return <lb/>
            should depend on the Cyprian goddess. Yon gentle bird <lb/>
            just ’scaped her fate ; and even as my heart within me <lb/>
            foresees according to this omen, so shall it surely be. But <lb/>
            come, friends, call on Cytherea to help you, and in this <lb/>
            very hour hearken to the persuasion of Argus."</p>
          <p>So spake he ; and the young men approved his words, <lb/>
            for they remembered the bidding of Phineus ; only Idas, <lb/>
            son of Aphareus, sprang up ; sore troubled was he, and he <lb/>
            cried aloud, " How now, pray, did we come hither in com­ <lb/>
            pany with women, that our men call on Cypris to come and <lb/>
            help us, and no longer on the great War-god ? Will ye, for <lb/>
            the sight of doves and hawks, stay you from your enter­ <lb/>
            prise ? get you gone, and take no thought for deeds of war, <lb/>
            but how to cajole weak girls by prayers."</p>
          <p>So cried he in his hot anger; and many of his comrades <lb/>
            muttered low, but there was none, I trow, that gave him <lb/>
            answer back. So down he sat much in wrath; but Jason <lb/>
            forthwith cheered them, and declared his mind thus, " Let <lb/>
            Argus go forth from the ship, since this finds favour with <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">περικάππεσεν</foreign>, literally " fell about it," i.e. fell on it and was pierced <lb/>
            by it. Cf. Sopb. Aias, <foreign xml:lang="grc">περιπτυχὴς φασγάνῳ</foreign>, literally " folded about his <lb/>
            sword," i.e. fallen upon it and pierced by it.</note> <pb n="119"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="L. 538-592.]"/><lb/>
            all, while we will now fasten our cables openly ashore out <lb/>
            from the river. For assuredly 'tis well to lie hid no longer, <lb/>
            crouching in fear from the battle-cry."</p>
          <p>Therewith, sent he Argus forth at once to go swiftly a <lb/>
            second time unto the city ; but they hauled their anchors <lb/>
            aboard at the bidding of the son of Æson, and rowed the <lb/>
            ship a little space from out the backwater, and moored her <lb/>
            to the shore.</p>
          <p>Anon Æetes held a gathering of the Colchians apart <lb/>
            from his house, where they sat aforetime, devising against <lb/>
            the Minyæ treachery intolerable and troubles. For he <lb/>
            threatened1 that, so soon as the oxen should have torn that <lb/>
            fellow in pieces, who had taken upon him the performance <lb/>
            of the grievous labour, he would then cut down an oak­ <lb/>
            thicket upon the wooded hill-top and burn their ship, <lb/>
            men and all, that they, with their over-weening schemes, <lb/>
            may splutter out2 their grievous insolence. For he would <lb/>
            never have received Phrixus, son of Æolus, as a guest within <lb/>
            his halls, for all his craving,—Phrixus who exceeded all <lb/>
            strangers in gentleness and holiness,-had not Zeus sent to <lb/>
            him his own messenger Hermes, that so Phrixus might <lb/>
            meet with a kindly host. Verily were pirates to come to <lb/>
            his land, they would not long be without sorrows of their <lb/>
            own, folk who make it their business to stretch out their <lb/>
            hand upon the goods of strangers, and to weave secret <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">στευτ̃ο</foreign>, " be threatened." From the sense of boasting that one is <lb/>
            so and so, or will do so and so, the transition to that of threatening is <lb/>
            not difficult. We find the word in three different significations : cf. ii. <lb/>
            1204," be avows himself to be; ” iii. 337, " is it destined ;” iii. 579, " he <lb/>
            threatened." </note><note type="footnote"> 2 <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀποφλύξωσιν</foreign>, a grim jest on the part of Æetes. The word means <lb/>
            “ to boil up, splutter ;" then " to babble idly," used by the king in scorn <lb/>
            of the words Jason had spoken, and also with an allusion to the effect <lb/>
            the fire would have on the heroes—“ fire makes water boil away, per­ <lb/>

            plots, and to harry the steadings of herdsmen in forays, <lb/>
            heralded by their dreaded shout. Moreover he said that <lb/>
            the sons of Phrixus, apart from this, should pay him a <lb/>
            proper penalty 1 for returning in the company of evil-doers <lb/>
            as their guides, that they might drive him from his honour <lb/>
            and his kingdom heedlessly ; for once on a time he had <lb/>
            heard a dismal warning from his father Helios, that he <lb/>
            must avoid the deep guile and plotting and the wily mis­ <lb/>
            chief of his own race. Wherefore he sent them, according <lb/>
            to their father's bidding, eager as they were, to the land of <lb/>
            Achæa, a long journey. But small fear had he of his <lb/>
            daughters, or of his son Absyrtus, that they would ever <lb/>
            devise any baleful plan ; but he thought these fell deeds <lb/>
            were to be accomplished among the race of Chalciope; and <lb/>
            so it was that terrible things did he pronounce2 in his wrath <lb/>
            against those other folk; and he made a mighty threat <lb/>
            that he would keep them from the ship and their comrades, <lb/>
            that none might escape destruction.</p>
          <p>Meantime Argus came unto the house of Æetes, and <lb/>
            strove to win his mother with every argument he knew, <lb/>
            that she might entreat Medea's aid; but she pondered the <lb/>
            matter first herself. For fear held her back, lest haply he <lb/>
            should win her over in vain, and contrary to fate; so fear­ <lb/>
            ful was she of her father's deadly anger, or lest, if she con­ <lb/>
            sented to his prayer, her deed might get abroad and be <lb/>
            clearly known.</p>
          <p>Now deep sleep relieved the maid Medea from her trou­ <lb/>
            bles, as she lay upon her bed. But anon fearsome cheating <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">μείλια</foreign> = anything that pleases; then a marriage portion; here equiva­ <lb/>

            dreams assailed her, as they will a maiden in her woe. <lb/>
            She thought yon stranger had taken that toil upon him, <lb/>
            not because he greatly desired to carry off the ram's fleece, <lb/>
            nor at all, for its sake, had he come to the city of Æetes, <lb/>
            but that he might lead her to his home to be his own true <lb/>
            wife ; and she dreamed that she herself strove with the <lb/>
            oxen, and did the toil right easily; but her parents made <lb/>
            light of their promise ; for they had set the yoking of the <lb/>
            oxen, not before their daughter, but before the stranger. <lb/>
            Then arose a strife of doubtful issue betwixt her father and <lb/>
            the strangers; and both did entrust it unto her to be even <lb/>
            as she should direct. At once she chose that stranger, and <lb/>
            forgat her parents, and grievous was their anguish, and <lb/>
            they cried out in anger; then did sleep forsake her, and <lb/>
            she awoke with a cry. And she arose quivering with terror, <lb/>
            and peered all round the walls of her chamber, and scarce <lb/>
            could she regain her courage as before in her breast, and <lb/>
            she uttered her voice aloud, " Ah ! woe is me ! how have <lb/>
            fearful dreams affrighted me ! I fear that this voyage of <lb/>
            the heroes is bringing some awful calamity. My heart is <lb/>
            in suspense1 for the stranger. Let him woo some Achæan <lb/>
            maiden, far away among his own people, and let my virgin <lb/>
            state and my parents' home be my care. Verily, though I <lb/>

            that would assuage the bitter grief in my heart."</p>
          <p>Therewith she rose and opened the door of her chamber, <lb/>
            barefoot, in her shift alone; and lo! she longed to go to <lb/>
            her sister, and she passed over the threshold of her room. <lb/>
            And long time she waited there at the entrance of her <lb/>
            chamber, held back by shame, and she turned her back <lb/>
            once more; and yet again she went from her room, and <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἠερέθονται</foreign>, a lengthened form of <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀείρομαι</foreign>, = " to hang floating in <lb/>

             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BOOK III."/><lb/>
            again stole back; for her feet bore her in vain this way <lb/>
            and that; yea, and oft as she was going straight on, <lb/>
            modesty kept her within; then would bold desire urge <lb/>
            her against the curb of modesty. Thrice she tried, and <lb/>
            thrice she held back ; the fourth time she turned and threw <lb/>
            herself face down upon the bed. As when a bride doth <lb/>
            mourn within her chamber a strong young husband, to <lb/>
            whom her brethren and parents have given her, and she <lb/>
            holds no converse with all her attendants for very shame <lb/>
            and thinking of him; but sitteth in a corner lamenting, <lb/>
            but him hath some doom destroyed, ere they twain have <lb/>
            had any joy each of the other's counsels ; while she, with <lb/>
            burning heart, looks on her widowed bed and sheds the <lb/>
            silent tear, that the women may not mock and scoff at <lb/>
            her ; like to her was Medea in her lamentation. Now on <lb/>
            a sudden, while she wept, a maid-servant coming forth <lb/>
            did hear her, one that had waited on her in her girlhood; <lb/>
            and forthwith she told Chalciope; now she was sitting <lb/>
            amongst her sons, devising how to win her sister to their <lb/>
            side. Yet not even so did she make light of it, when she <lb/>
            heard the maid's strange story, but she hasted in amaze <lb/>
            from room to room throughout the house to the chamber <lb/>
            wherein the maiden lay in her anguish, and tore her <lb/>
            cheeks;. and when she saw her eyes all dimmed with tears, <lb/>
            she said to her, " Ah, woe is me! Medea, and wherefore <lb/>
            dost thou shed these tears ? What has happened to thee ? <lb/>
            what awful grief hath come into thy heart? Has some <lb/>
            disease of heaven's sending fastened on thy limbs, or hast <lb/>
            thou learnt some deadly threat of my father concerning <lb/>
            me and my sons? Would that I no longer beheld this <lb/>
            house of my parents, nor their city, but dwelt in the utter­ <lb/>
            most parts of the earth, where is not so much as heard the <lb/>
            name of Colchians."</p>
          <p>So spake she, but a blush rose to her sister's cheeks, and <lb/>
            long time maiden modesty stayed her from answering, fain <pb n="123"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="L. 651-714.]"/><lb/>
            as she was. At one moment the word would rise to the <lb/>
            tip of her tongue, at another it would speed back deep <lb/>
            within her breast. Oft her eager lips yearned to tell their <lb/>
            tale, but the words came no farther. At the last she <lb/>
            made this subtle speech, for love's bold hand was heavy on <lb/>
            her, " Chalciope, my heart is in sore suspense for thy sons, <lb/>
            for fear lest our father slay them outright with the <lb/>
            strangers. For as I fell asleep just now and slumbered <lb/>
            for a little space, I saw a fearful vision. May some god <lb/>
            make it of none effect, and mayest thou get no bitter grief <lb/>
            for thy sons !"</p>
          <p>So spake she, making trial of her sister; and the other <lb/>
            thus answered : " Lo! I came to thee myself bent upon <lb/>
            this business entirely, to see if thou couldst help me with <lb/>
            counsel and devise some aid. Come, swear by heaven and <lb/>
            earth that thou wilt keep in thy heart what I shall say to <lb/>
            thee, and will help me in the work. I pray thee by the <lb/>
            blessed gods, by thyself, and by our parents, do not see <lb/>
            them piteously destroyed by some evil fate; or else will I <lb/>
            die with my dear sons and be to thee hereafter a fearful <lb/>
            spirit of vengeance from Hades."</p>
          <p>So spake she, and forthwith her tears gushed forth in <lb/>
            streams, and she clasped her hands below her knees, and <lb/>
            let her head sink on her bosom. Then did the two sisters <lb/>
            make piteous lament over each other, and there arose <lb/>
            through the house a faint 1 sound of women weeping in their <lb/>
            sorrow.</p>
          <p>But Medea first addressed the other, sore distressed: <lb/>
            " God help us, sister! what cure can I work for thee ? <lb/>
            what a word is thine, with thy dread curses and spirits of <lb/>
            vengeance! Would that it were surely in my power to save <lb/>
            thy sons! Witness now that awful oath of the Colchians, <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">λεπταλέη ἰωὴ</foreign>, properly " fine, delicate." In this connexion it would <lb/>
            seem to mean " subdued," so that their grief might not be noticed and <lb/>
            cause suspicion. </note> <pb n="124"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BOOK III."/><lb/>
            which thyself wouldst have me swear; great heaven and <lb/>
            earth beneath, mother of gods! as far as in me lies I will <lb/>
            not fail thee, so thou ask aught I can perform."</p>
          <p>So spake she, and Chalciope thus made answer: " Canst <lb/>
            thou then devise no trick, no help for the enterprise of the <lb/>
            stranger, even if his own lips ask it, for the sake of my <lb/>
            children? lo! Argus is come from him, urging me to try <lb/>
            and gain thy help; him did I leave within the house the <lb/>
            while I came hither."</p>
          <p>So she; and the other's heart within her leapt for joy, <lb/>
            and a deep blush withal mantled o'er her fair skin, and a <lb/>
            mist came o'er her eyes as her heart melted, and thus she <lb/>
            answered: " Chalciope, I will do even as is dear and pleas­ <lb/>
            ing to you. May the dawn shine no more upon mine eyes ; <lb/>
            mayst thou no longer see me in the land of the living, if I <lb/>
            hold aught before thy soul, or before thy sons, who verily <lb/>
            are my cousins, my kinsmen dear, and of mine own age. <lb/>
            Even so I do declare I am thy sister and thy daughter too, <lb/>
            for thou didst hold me to thy breast while yet a babe, <lb/>
            equally with those thy sons, as ever I heard in days gone <lb/>
            by from my mother. But go now, hide my service in silence <lb/>
            that I may make good my promise without the knowledge <lb/>
            of my parents, and at dawn will I carry to the temple of <lb/>
            Hecate drugs to charm the bulls."</p>
          <p>So Chalciope went back again from the chamber; while <lb/>
            she set to devising some help for her sister's sons. But <lb/>
            once more did shame and an horrible dread seize her when <lb/>
            she was alone, to think that she was devising such things <lb/>
            for a man, without her father's knowledge.</p>
          <p>Then did night spread darkness o'er the earth, and they <lb/>
            who were at sea, the mariners, looked forth from their <lb/>
            ships toward the Bear and the stars of Orion ; and now did <lb/>
            every wayfarer and gatekeeper long for sleep; and o'er <lb/>
            every mother, weeping for children dead, fell the pall of <lb/>
            deep slumber; no more did dogs howl through the town; <pb n="125"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="L. 715-781.]"/><lb/>
            no more was heard the noise of men, but silence wrapped. <lb/>
            the darkling gloom. Yet not at all did sleep shed its sweet­ <lb/>
            ness o'er Medea; for in her love for the son of Æson many <lb/>
            a care kept her awake, terrified at the mighty strength of <lb/>
            the bulls, before whom he was to die a shameful death on <lb/>
            Ares' acre. And her heart was wildly stirred within her <lb/>
            breast; as when a sun-beam reflected from water plays <lb/>
            upon the wall of a house, water just poured into a basin <lb/>
            or a pail maybe ; hither and thither it darts and dances on <lb/>
            the quick eddy; even so the maiden's heart was fluttering <lb/>
            in her breast, and tears of pity flowed from her eyes ; and, <lb/>
            ever within, the pain was wasting her, smouldering through <lb/>
            her body, and about her weakened nerves, and right be­ <lb/>
            neath the back of her head,1 where the keenest pain doth <lb/>
            enter in, when the tireless love-god lets loose 2 his tortures <lb/>
            on the heart. At one time she thought she would give <lb/>
            him drugs to charm the bulls, at another she thought nay, <lb/>
            but that she would die herself; anon she would not die <lb/>
            herself, nor would she give him the drugs, but quietly even <lb/>
            so would endure her sorrow. So she sat halting between <lb/>
            two opinions, then spake, " Ah, woe is me! am I now to <lb/>
            toss hither and thither in woe ? my mind is wholly at a, <lb/>
            loss ; there is no help for my suffering, but it burneth ever <lb/>
            thus. Oh ! would that I had died by the swift arrows of <lb/>
            Artemis, or ever I had seen him, or ever the sons of Chal­ <lb/>
            ciope started for the Achæan land; some god or some <lb/>
            spirit of vengeance hath brought them hither from thence <lb/>
            to cause us tears and woe enow. Well, let him perish in <lb/>
            his attempt, if 'tis his lot to die upon the fallow. For how <lb/>
            can I contrive the drugs, and my parents know it not ? <lb/>
            what tale am I to tell about them ? What cunning, what <lb/>
            crafty scheme shall there be for their aid ? Shall I greet <lb/>
            him kindly if I see him alone apart from his comrades ? <note type="footnote"> I <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἰνίον</foreign> strictly is " the nape of the neck." </note><note type="footnote"> 2 <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐνισκίμψωσιν</foreign>, literally " to dash in or upon " (trans.). </note> <pb n="126"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BOOK III."/><lb/>
            Unhappy maid am I; methinks I would not be quit of sor­ <lb/>
            row even though he were dead and gone. For sorrow will <lb/>
            come upon me in the hour that he is bereft of life. Away <lb/>
            with shame, perish beauty! he shall be saved, unhurt, and <lb/>
            by my help ; then let him go whithersoever his heart listeth. <lb/>
            But may I die the self-same day that he fulfilleth his <lb/>
            enterprise, either hanging by my neck from the roof-tree, <lb/>
            or tasting of drugs that rive body and soul asunder. But, <lb/>
            if I die thus, every eye will wink1 and mock at me, and <lb/>
            every city far away will ring with the tale of my death, <lb/>
            and the Colchian women will make a byword of me for <lb/>
            their unseemly gibes ; the maid who cared so dearly for a <lb/>
            stranger that she died for him, who shamed her home <lb/>
            and parents by yielding to her mad passion. What dis­ <lb/>
            grace is there that will not be mine ? All me! for my <lb/>
            infatuation! Far better will it be this very night to leave <lb/>
            life behind in my chamber by an unseen fate, avoiding <lb/>
            all ill reproaches, or ever I complete this infamous dis­ <lb/>
            grace !"</p>
          <p>Therewith she went to fetch a casket, wherein were laid <lb/>
            many drugs for her use, some healing, others very deadly. <lb/>
            And she laid it on her lap, and wept. And her bosom was <lb/>
            wet with her ceaseless weeping, for the tears flowed in <lb/>
            streams as she sat there, making piteous lament for her <lb/>
            fate. Then she hasted to choose a deadly drug, that she <lb/>
            might taste thereof. And lo! she was just loosing the <lb/>
            fastenings of the casket, eager to draw them forth, poor <lb/>
            unhappy lady, when in an instant passed across her mind <lb/>
            an awful horror of loathly Hades; and long time she <lb/>
            stayed her hand in speechless fear, and life with all its <lb/>
            cares seemed sweet to her. For she thought of all the <lb/>
            joyous things there are amongst the living, and of her <lb/>
            happy band of companions, as a maiden will; and the sun <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπιλλίζουσι</foreign> = "to wink with the eye" in mockery. Cf. supra, i. <lb/>
            486, where it is used of the unsteady gaze of a drunken man. </note> <pb n="127"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="L. 782-844.]"/><lb/>
            grew sweeter to her than before to look upon, just to see 1 <lb/>
            if really in her heart of hearts she longed for each of them. <lb/>
            So she laid the casket down again f rom off her knees, changing <lb/>
            her mind by the prompting of Hera, and no more did her <lb/>
            purpose waver otherwhither ; but she longed for the dawn <lb/>
            to rise and come at once, that she might give Jason her <lb/>
            magic drugs as she had covenanted,2 and meet him face to <lb/>
            face. And oft would she loose the bolts of her door, as <lb/>
            she watched for the daylight; and welcome to her was the <lb/>
            light, when Dawn sent it forth, and each man went on his <lb/>
            way through the city.</p>
          <p>Now Argus bade his brethren abide there yet, that they <lb/>
            might learn the mind and plans of the maiden, but himself <lb/>
            went forth and came unto the ship again.</p>
          <p>But the maid Medea, soon as ever she saw the light of <lb/>
            dawn, caught up her golden tresses in her hands, which <lb/>
            she had let hang about her in careless disarray, and wiped <lb/>
            clean her tear-stained cheeks; and she cleansed her <lb/>
            skin with ointment of heavenly fragrance, and put on a <lb/>
            fair robe, fastened with brooches deftly turned ; and upon <lb/>
            her head, divinely fair, she cast a shining veil. Then she <lb/>
            passed forth from her chamber there, treading the ground <lb/>
            firmly, in forgetfulness of her sorrows, which were close <lb/>
            upon her in their countless legions, while others were yet <lb/>
            to follow afterward. And she bade her handmaids, who <lb/>
            passed the night in the entering in of her fragrant bower, <lb/>
            -twelve maids in all of her own age who had not yet <lb/>
            found a mate,-quickly to yoke mules to the wain, to bear <lb/>
            her to the lovely shrine of Hecate. Then did the maidens <lb/>
            make ready the wain; but she, the while, chose from the <lb/>
            depth of her casket a drug, which men say is called the <note type="footnote"> 1 "Just to see," &amp;c., i.e. to see if she did not really long for them in <lb/>
            spite of her belief that they were nothing to her any more. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 <foreign xml:lang="grc">συνθεσίῃσι</foreign>, " according to her covenant." Medea had promised her <lb/>

             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BOOK III."/><lb/>
            drug of Prometheus. If a man should anoint his body <lb/>
            therewith, after appeasing Persephone, that maiden only- <lb/>
            begotten, with midnight sacrifice ; verily that man could <lb/>
            not be wounded by the blows of bronze weapons, nor <lb/>
            would he yield to blazing fire, but on that day1 should his <lb/>
            valiancy and might master theirs. This first had its birth, <lb/>
            when the ravening eagle let drip to earth upon the wolds of <lb/>
            Caucasus the bleeding life-stream 2 of hapless Prometheus. <lb/>
            The flower thereof, as it were a cubit high, appeareth in <lb/>
            colour like the saffron of Corycus, growing upon a double <lb/>
            stalk, but its root within the ground resembleth flesh just <lb/>
            cut. Now she had gathered for her drugs the dark juice <lb/>
            thereof, like to the sap of a mountain oak, in a Caspian <lb/>
            shell, after she had washed herself in seven eternal springs, <lb/>
            and seven times had called on Brimo,3 good nursing-mother, <lb/>
            who roams by night, goddess of the nether world, and <lb/>
            queen of the dead, in the murk of night, in sable raiment <lb/>
            clad. And, from beneath, the dark earth quaked and <lb/>
            bellowed, as the Titan root4 was cut, and the son of Impetus <lb/>
            too did groan, frantic with pain. That simple drew she <lb/>
            forth and placed within her fragrant girdle, that was <lb/>
            fastened about her fair waist. And forth to the door she <lb/>
            came and mounted the swift car, and with her on either <lb/>
            side went two handmaids; so she took the reins and the <lb/>
            shapely whip in her right hand, and drove through the <lb/>
            town; while those others, her handmaids, holding to the <lb/>
            body of the wain behind, ran along the broad high-road, <lb/>
            having kilted their fine robes up to their white knees. <lb/>
            Fair as the daughter of Leto,5 when she mounts her golden <lb/>
            car, and drives her fleet fawns o'er the downs across the <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">κε</foreign>ĩv’ <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἠ̃μαρ</foreign>, i.e. that day only. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἰχω̃α</foreign> = the blood of a god. 3 Hecate. </note><note type="footnote"> * The root sprang from the blood of Prometheus, who was a Titan, <lb/>

            calm waters of Parthenius, or haply from her bath in <lb/>
            Amnisus' stream, as she cometh from far to the rich <lb/>
            steam of a hetacomb ; and with her come the nymphs, that <lb/>
            bear her company, some gathering by the brink of the <lb/>
            Amnisian spring, others about the groves and rocks with <lb/>
            their countless rills ; and around her wild creatures fawn <lb/>
            and whimper, trembling at her approach. Even so the <lb/>
            maidens hasted through the city, and the people made <lb/>
            way on either side, shunning the eye of the princess. Now <lb/>
            when she had left the streets of the town, with their fair <lb/>
            buildings, and had come in her driving across the plain <lb/>
            unto the temple, then she lighted down quickly from the <lb/>
            smooth-running wain and spake thus amongst her maidens: <lb/>
            " Friends, verily I have sinned an awful sin, for I find no <lb/>
            cause to be wroth with yon strangers, who are roaming <lb/>
            about our land. The whole city is smitten with dismay ; <lb/>
            wherefore also none of the women hath come hither, who <lb/>
            afore time did gather here day by day. Yet since we are <lb/>
            here, and none other comes forth against us, let us with <lb/>
            soothing song and dance satisfy our souls without stint, <lb/>
            and after we have plucked these fair blossoms of the tender <lb/>
            field, then in that very hour will we return. Yea, and ye <lb/>
            this day shall go unto your homes with many a rich gift, <lb/>
            an ye will grant me this my desire; for Argus is urgent 1 <lb/>
            with me, and so too is Chalciope ;-keep what ye hear of <lb/>
            me silent in your hearts, lest my words come to my father's <lb/>
            ears ;—lo ! they bid me take yon stranger's gifts, who hath <lb/>
            taken on him to strive with the oxen, and save him from <lb/>
            his fell emprise. So I agreed unto their words, and I bade <lb/>
            him meet me here alone, apart from his comrades, that we <lb/>
            may divide amongst ourselves those gifts, if haply he bring <lb/>
            them with him, and we may give him in return a drug <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">παρατρέπει</foreign>, not in its usual sense of " turning a person away from a <lb/>

            more baleful1 than he knows. But do ye stand aloof from <lb/>
            me against his coming."</p>
          <p>So spake she, and her cunning counsel pleased them all. <lb/>
            Anon Argus drew the son of Æson apart from the crew, as <lb/>
            soon as he heard from his brothers, that she had gone at <lb/>
            daybreak to the holy temple of Hecate, and across the <lb/>
            plain he led him; and with them went Mopsus, son of <lb/>
            Ampycus, skilled in interpreting omens from birds when <lb/>
            they appeared, and skilled in giving the right advice when <lb/>
            they were gone.</p>
          <p>Never was there such a man amongst the men of bygone <lb/>
            days, neither among all the heroes who sprang from Zeus <lb/>
            himself, nor among those who were of the blood of other <lb/>
            immortal gods, as the wife of Zeus made Jason on that <lb/>
            day, either to see face to face or to talk with.2 Even his <lb/>
            comrades marvelled, as they gazed at him resplendent with <lb/>
            grace; and the son of Ampycus was glad as they went, for <lb/>
            already, I trow, he boded, how each thing would be.</p>
          <p>Now there is by the path along the plain, nigh to the <lb/>
            temple, a black poplar with a crown of countless leaves, <lb/>
            whereon, full oft, chattering crows would roost. And one <lb/>
            of these, as she flapped her wings aloft on the branches, <lb/>
            declared the will of Hera: " Here is a sorry seer, that hath <lb/>
            not so much knowing as children have; for no sweet word <lb/>
            of love will the maid speak to yon youth, so long as there <lb/>
            be other strangers with him. Begone, thou sorry prophet, <lb/>
            dull-witted seer, for 'tis not thou, whom Cypris and her <lb/>
            gentle Loves inspire, in their kindness.”</p>
          <p>So spake the chiding crow, and Mopsus smiled to hear <lb/>
            the bird's inspired utterance, and thus spake he: " Son of <lb/>
            Æson, get thee now to the temple of the goddess, wherein <lb/>
            thou wilt find the maiden; very kindly shall her greeting <note type="footnote"> 1 More deadly than anyone else could give. </note><note type="footnote"> a i.e. he was not only noble to look upon, but he had also a shrewd <lb/>

             <note type="correspondsTo" n="L. 909-976.]"/><lb/>
            be to thee, thanks to Cypris, who will help thee in thy <lb/>
            labours, even as Phineus, son of Agenor, did say before. <lb/>
            But we twain, Argus and I, will stand in this very spot <lb/>
            aloof, awaiting thy coming ; and do thou thyself alone <lb/>
            entreat her, turning her heart by words of wisdom."</p>
          <p>' So spake he very sagely ; and nigh at hand they both <lb/>
            agreed to wait. Nor, I trow, had Medea any thought but <lb/>
            this, for all her play ; for none of all the games she played <lb/>
            would serve for her amusement long. But she kept <lb/>
            changing them in confusion, nor could she keep her eyes <lb/>
            at rest towards her group of maids, but earnestly she would <lb/>
            gaze o'er the paths afar, turning her cheeks aside. Oft <lb/>
            her heart sank broken within her breast, whenever she <lb/>
            fancied a footfall or a breath of wind was hurrying by. <lb/>
            But very soon came Jason in sight before her longing eyes, <lb/>
            striding high o'er the plain, like Sirius when he rises from <lb/>
            ocean, very fair and clear to see, but bringing woe unspeak­ <lb/>
            able to flocks; so fair was the son of Æson to see as he <lb/>
            came nigh, but the sight of him brought hateful faintness <lb/>
            upon her. Her heart sank within her breast, and her eyes <lb/>
            grew dim withal, and o'er her cheeks rushed the hot blush; <lb/>
            and her knees had no strength to move backward or for­ <lb/>
            ward, but her feet were rooted to the ground under her. <lb/>
            Now her handmaids, the while, had withdrawn from them, <lb/>
            one and all; so they twain stood facing one another without <lb/>
            word or sound, like oaks or lofty pines, which stand rooted <lb/>
            side by side in peace upon the mountains, when winds are <lb/>
            still; but lo ! there comes a breath of wind to rustle them, <lb/>
            and sighs, that none can number, steal therefrom; even <lb/>
            so those twain were soon to tell out all their tale before <lb/>
            the breath of Love. But the son of Æson perceived that she <lb/>
            was scared by some bewilderment from heaven, and with <lb/>
            a kindly smile he thus hailed her, " Why, maiden, art thou <lb/>
            so fearful of me when I come alone ? . Verily I was never <lb/>
            aforetime, not even when I dwelt in mine own country, <pb n="132"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BOOK III."/><lb/>
            one of those braggart fellows. Wherefore fear not ex­ <lb/>
            ceedingly, maiden, either to question me or say what is in <lb/>
            thine heart. Nay, but since we are met together as friends <lb/>
            in this most holy place, where to sin were wrong, speak <lb/>
            openly and tell me all; and deceive me not with comfort­ <lb/>
            able words,1 for at first thou didst promise thine own sister <lb/>
            to give me the drugs my heart desired. By Hecate herself, <lb/>
            by thy parents, and by Zeus, whose hand is over strangers <lb/>
            and suppliants, I entreat thee. As stranger and as sup­ <lb/>
            pliant both, am I come hither to thee to implore thee in <lb/>
            my sore need. For without thee never shall I achieve my <lb/>
            dismal task. And I will make thee recompense hereafter <lb/>
            for thy help, as is right, making thy name and fame <lb/>
            glorious, as becometh those who dwell apart 2; yea, and in <lb/>
            like manner shall the other heroes spread thy fame through <lb/>
            Hellas on their return ; and so shall the heroes' wives and <lb/>
            mothers, who now belike are sitting on the shore and <lb/>
            mourning for us, whose grievous sufferings thou wilt <lb/>
            scatter to the winds. In days gone by, Ariadne,3 daughter <lb/>
            of Minos, did, of her good heart, free Theseus from his evil <lb/>
            task; she it was whom Pasiphae, daughter of the Sun-god, <lb/>
            bore. Yea,4 and she went aboard his ship with him and left <note type="footnote"> 1 Smooth words which will not offend the ear, but yet will cause <lb/>

            the Minotaur and fiud his way out of a pathless maze; so Theseus took <lb/>
            her away on his ship to sail to Athens, but abandoned her cruelly in <lb/>
            Naxos, where, however, the god Dionysus found her, and set her as a <lb/>
            star in heaven. </note><note type="footnote"> 4 Mai, emphatic. Ariadne even went aboard the ship of Theseus at his <lb/>
            request; I only ask for your aid without any further sacrifice. </note><note type="footnote"> <foreign xml:lang="grc">εὔνασε χόλον</foreign>. Either she fled because Minos had only lulled his <lb/>
            anger for a time, and would make her suffer for her share in the success <lb/>
            of Theseus later on, or else the expression might mean that Minos <lb/>
            having swallowed his vexation, allowed Ariadne to sail away with the </note> <pb n="133"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="L. 977-1026.]"/><lb/>
            her country, since Minos did lull his rage; and the im­ <lb/>
            mortal gods showed their love as well, for there in mid sky <lb/>
            is her sign, a crown of stars, which men call Ariadne's <lb/>
            crown, wheeling by night amid the heavenly constellations. <lb/>
            Such thanks shalt thou too have from the gods, if thou <lb/>
            wilt save this famous host of chieftains. For surely from <lb/>
            thy form, methinks, thou shouldst excel in gentle acts of <lb/>
            kindness."</p>
          <p>So spake he praising her; and she cast down her eyes <lb/>
            with a sweet smile,1 and her heart within her melted, as <lb/>
            he extolled her. And she looked straight into his eyes, <lb/>
            and had no word to answer him withal at first, but longed <lb/>
            to tell him all at once together. And forth from her <lb/>
            fragrant girdle she drew the drug ungrudgingly, and he <lb/>
            with joy took it in his hands at once. And now would <lb/>
            she have drawn her whole soul forth from her breast and <lb/>
            given it him at his desire eagerly; so mightily did love <lb/>
            light up his sweet torch from the son of Æson’s yellow <lb/>
            locks, and snatched bright glances from her eyes; and her <lb/>
            heart wasted and melted within her, as the dew upon roses <lb/>
            melts and wastes away in the sun's beams at morn. But <lb/>
            they would fix their eyes one time upon the ground in <lb/>
            modesty, and then again would cast a glance at each <lb/>
            other, with a smile of love in their glad eyes. At the last, <lb/>
            and scarcely then, the maiden thus did greet him:</p>
          <p>" Take heed now, that I may devise some help for thee. <lb/>
            When my father hath given thee, at thy coming for them, <note type="footnote"> adventurer. This view is favoured, if not confirmed, by a remark of <lb/>
            Jason's (infra, 1099), where he speaks of the aid- lent by Minos to <lb/>
            Theseus for the sake of his daughter. Homer styles him <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὀλο</foreign>ó<foreign xml:lang="grc">φρων</foreign>, <lb/>
            “ the man of baleful thoughts.” Also, it would tend to increase the con­ <lb/>
            fidence of Medea if she could be persuaded that her father would forgive <lb/>
            her in the end, and let her marry her lover as Ariadne had married <lb/>
            Theseus. </note><note type="footnote"> 1 “ A smile divinely sweet." <foreign xml:lang="grc">νεκτάρεον</foreign> is mostly used of sweet smells, <lb/>

            the fell teeth from the snake's jaws to sow withal, then <lb/>
            watch for the hour when the night is evenly divided in <lb/>
            twain, and after washing thyself in the stream of the tire­ <lb/>
            less river, dig a round hole, alone apart from the others, in <lb/>
            sable garb ; there slay a ewe and sacrifice her whole, having <lb/>
            heaped high the fire above the hole itself. And propitiate <lb/>
            Hecate, daughter of Perses, the only-begotten, pouring liba­ <lb/>
            tions of honey from a chalice. Then when thou hast <lb/>
            taken heed to appease the goddess, draw back again from <lb/>
            the fire; and let no sound of feet or howling of dogs <lb/>
            drive thee to turn round, lest haply thou cut all short and <lb/>
            come not thyself back duly to thy companions. At dawn <lb/>
            soak this drug; then strip and with it anoint thy body as <lb/>
            it were with oil; and there shall be in it boundless valiancy <lb/>
            and great strength, and thou wilt think thyself a match <lb/>
            for deathless gods, not for men. Moreover, let thy shield <lb/>
            and sword and spear be sprinkled therewith. Then shall <lb/>
            not the keen swords of the earth-born men cut thee, nor <lb/>
            shall the flame of those deadly bulls dart forth resistlessly <lb/>
            against thee. Yet shalt thou not be thus mighty for a. <lb/>
            long space, but for that day only; yet never shrink thou <lb/>
            from thy enterprise. And I will supply thee yet another <lb/>
            help. So soon as thou hast yoked the strong oxen, and by <lb/>
            thy might and manhood hast quickly ploughed the hard <lb/>
            fallow, and they, the giants, at once spring up along the <lb/>
            furrows when the teeth of the snake are sown over the <lb/>
            dark soil, if thou but watch them rising in crowds from <lb/>
            the lea, then cast secretly at them a heavy rock ; and they <lb/>
            will destroy one another upon it, like fierce dogs about <lb/>
            their food ; but be not thyself eager for the fray. Hereby <lb/>
            shalt thou carry yon fleece to Hellas, far from Æa, I trow. <lb/>
            Yet go, whither thou listest, when thou art gone hence."</p>
          <p>So spake she, and dropping her eyes in silence before <lb/>
            her did wet her cheek, divinely fair, with warm tears, <lb/>
            mourning the day when he would wander far from her <pb n="135"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="L. 1027-1093.]"/><lb/>
            across the main. And once again she spake to him with <lb/>
            sad words, taking hold on his right hand, for lo! shame <lb/>
            had left her gaze: " Remember the name of Medea, if <lb/>
            haply thou return one day to thy home; so will I remem­ <lb/>
            ber thee when thou art gone. And tell me this in kind­ <lb/>
            ness, where is thy home, where wilt thou fare from hence <lb/>
            in thy ship across the sea ? Wilt thou go haply nigh to <lb/>
            rich Orchomenus, or may-be toward the Ææan isle ? And <lb/>
            tell me of the maid thou didst speak of, the far-famed <lb/>
            daughter of Pasiphae,l who is of my father's kindred."</p>
          <p>So spake she, and, as the maiden wept, love in his <lb/>
            might stole o'er him as well, and thus he answered her, <lb/>
            " Yea, verily, if I escape my fate, methinks I will never <lb/>
            forget thee by night, nor yet by day, if indeed I shall <lb/>
            escape scatheless to Achæa, and Æetes set not before us <lb/>
            some other toil yet worse than this. But if it please thee <lb/>
            to learn of my country, I will tell thee, for much doth my <lb/>
            heart bid me myself as well. There is a land, ringed <lb/>
            round with steep hills, rich withal in sheep and pasture, <lb/>
            where Prometheus, son of Iapetus, begat goodly Deuca­ <lb/>
            lion,2 who was the first to found cities and build temples <lb/>
            for the immortal gods, and the first too to lord it over <lb/>
            men. Hæmonia, the folk who dwell around, do call that <lb/>
            land. Therein is Iolchos itself, my city, and in it too are <lb/>
            many other cities, where men have not so much as heard <lb/>
            the name of the Ææan isle 3; there is, indeed a legend that <lb/>
            Minyas, of the race of Æolus, once started from thence <lb/>
            and founded the town of Orchomenus, that borders on <note type="footnote"> 1 Pasiphae was a daughter of Helios, and Æetes was a son of the same <lb/>

            Thessaly, and with his wife Pyrrha was supposed to be the only sur­ <lb/>

            the Cadmeans. But why do I tell thee all these idle <lb/>
            tales, and of our home and of famous Ariadne, daughter <lb/>
            of Minos, for that was the glorious name men gave the <lb/>
            lovely maiden, of whom thou askest me ? Would that, as <lb/>
            Minos was then well pleased with Theseus for her sake, so <lb/>
            too thy father might be at one with us! "</p>
          <p>So spake he, caressing her with fond and tender words. <lb/>
            But grief, most bitter, stirred her heart, and in her distress <lb/>
            she hailed him with earnest speech: " It may be that in <lb/>
            Hellas these things are fair, to heed the ties of kin ; but <lb/>
            Æetes is not such another amongst men, as thou sayest <lb/>
            Minos, the husband of Pasiphae, was; nor can I compare <lb/>
            with Ariadne; wherefore tell me nought of hospitality. <lb/>
            Only do thou, when thou comest to Iolchos, remember <lb/>
            me; and I will remember thee even in spite of my parents. <lb/>
            And may there come to me from a far-off land some <lb/>
            voice, or some bird with tidings, when thou hast forgotten <lb/>
            me; or may the swift winds catch me up and bear me <lb/>
            hence across the sea to Iolchos, that I may remind thee that <lb/>
            thou didst escape by my aid, reproaching thee to thy <lb/>
            face! Would I might then sit me down openly1 in thy <lb/>
            halls!" .</p>
          <p>So spake she, shedding piteous tears adown her cheeks, <lb/>
            but Jason caught her up2 there and said: " God help thee, <lb/>
            lady! leave the winds to wander emptily, and that bird <lb/>
            too to bring thee tidings, for thy words are light as wind. <lb/>
            For if thou ever come to those abodes and the land of Hellas, <lb/>
            thou shalt have honour and respect amongst men and <lb/>
            women, and they shall reverence thee even as a goddess, <lb/>
            since their sons did return home again by thy counsel, <lb/>

          <p>So spake he, and her heart within her melted as she <lb/>
            heard, and yet she shuddered at the thought of that dark1 <lb/>
            enterprise, poor maiden ; but she was not long to refuse a <lb/>
            home in Hellas. For such was the mind of Hera, that <lb/>
            Ææan Medea should come to sacred Iolchos, to the bane <lb/>
            of Pelias, leaving her own country. But now were her <lb/>
            handmaidens looking about for her silently at a distance, <lb/>
            much distressed, for the time of day demanded the <lb/>
            maiden's return home to her mother. But she thought <lb/>
            not yet of going, for her heart rejoiced both in his beauty <lb/>
            and his flattering words; but the son of Æson, seeing that <lb/>
            it was now late, did say, " 'Tis time to depart, lest the sun <lb/>
            sink before we know it, and some stranger get to know all; <lb/>
            yet will we meet again at this tryst."</p>
          <p>Thus far those twain made trial of each other with <lb/>
            gentle words; and then again they paired; Jason hasting <lb/>
            back in joy to his comrades and the ship, and she to her <lb/>
            handmaids ; and they came nigh to meet her in a body, <lb/>
            but she heeded them not as they gathered about her, for <lb/>
            her soul had winged its flight to soar amid the clouds. <lb/>
            With random steps she mounted the swift wain, and in <lb/>
            one hand took the reins and in the other the carven whip <lb/>
            to drive the mules withal, and they dashed swiftly city­ <lb/>
            ward to her home. Now when she was come thither, <lb/>
            Chalciope, in agony for her sons, did question her; but <lb/>
            she, at a loss through fear and doubt, heard never a word, <lb/>
            and made no haste to answer her questions. But she sat <lb/>
            her down on a low stool at the foot of the couch, leaning <lb/>
            her cheek on her left hand, and her eyes were wet with <lb/>
            tears, as she darkly pondered what an evil work she was <lb/>
            sharing by her counsels. <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐργ</foreign>’ <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀίδηλα</foreign>, " works whose issue she could not see." </note></p><pb n="138"/>
            
          <p><note type="correspondsTo" n="[BOOK III."/>But when the son of Æson was again come among his <lb/>
            comrades in the place where he had left them when he <lb/>
            went away, he started to go with them unto the gathering <lb/>
            of the heroes, telling them each thing; and together they <lb/>
            drew nigh the ship. And the others did warmly greet <lb/>
            him, when they saw him, and questioned him. And he <lb/>
            amongst them all did tell the maiden's counsels, showing <lb/>
            them the awful drug; only one sat alone apart from his <lb/>
            comrades, nursing his rage, even Idas; but the rest in <lb/>
            gladness, with peaceful hearts, were busying themselves <lb/>
            the while about their beds, for dark night had stayed their <lb/>
            hands. But at dawn sent they to Æetes two men, to ask <lb/>
            him for the seed, first of all Telamon, great warrior, and <lb/>
            with him Æthalides, Hermes' famous child. Forth on <lb/>
            their way went they, nor was their journey in vain, for <lb/>
            JEetes, the prince, gave them, at their coming, the fell <lb/>
            teeth for the task of that Aonian 1 dragon, which Cadmus <lb/>
            slew in Ogygian Thebes at its post by the Aretian spring, <lb/>
            what time he came thither in quest of Europa; there he <lb/>
            dwelt, guided thither by a cow,2 which Apollo vouchsafed <lb/>
            to go before him on his way according to his oracle. These <lb/>
            teeth the goddess Tritonis3 had drawn from the serpent's <lb/>
            jaws, and given equally to Æetes and to Cadmus, who <lb/>
            himself slew the monster. Now he, even Cadmus, son of <lb/>
            Agenor, sowed his share upon the plains of Bœotia, and <lb/>
            founded a race of earth-born men from the remnant left <lb/>
            after the harvesting of Ares' spear; but the rest Æetes at <lb/>
            that time readily gave them to bear unto the ship, for he <note type="footnote"> 1 i.e. Bœotian. Bceotia originally was called Aonia. Thebes was <lb/>

            never thought that Jason would make an end of his toil, <lb/>
            even if he should cast the yoke upon the oxen.</p>
          <p>Far in the west the sun was sinking beneath the dark <lb/>
            earth, beyond the farthest hills of the Ethiopians; and <lb/>
            night was yoking his steeds ; so those heroes made ready <lb/>
            their beds upon the ground by the hawsers. But Jason, <lb/>
            soon as ever the stars of Helice, the bright Bear, did set, <lb/>
            and all the firmament of heaven grew still, gat him to the <lb/>
            wilderness, like some stealthy thief, with all that was <lb/>
            needful, for by day had he taken thought for everything ; <lb/>
            and Argus went with him bringing a ewe and milk from <lb/>
            the flock, which things he took from the ship itself. But <lb/>
            when he saw a spot, far from the tread of man, in a clear 1 <lb/>
            water-mead beneath the open sky, then first of all he <lb/>
            washed his tender body devoutly in the sacred river, and <lb/>
            then put on a sable robe, which Hypsipyle of Lemnos erst <lb/>
            gave him, in memory of many a night of love. Next he <lb/>
            dug a hole in the ground, a cubit deep, and piled therein <lb/>
            cleft wood, and cut the throat of the sheep and laid it <lb/>
            carefully thereupon ; then did he kindle the logs by putting <lb/>
            fire under, and he poured upon the sacrifice mixed libations, <lb/>
            calling Hecate by her name Brimo to help him in his toil. <lb/>
            So then he called upon her and then stept back, and she, <lb/>
            that awful goddess, heard him and came to the sacrifice of <lb/>
            the son of Æson from the nethermost hell, and about her <lb/>
            on the branches of the oaks twined gruesome snakes, and <lb/>
            there was the flash of countless torches, and the dogs of <lb/>
            hell howled loudly round her. About her path all the <lb/>
            meadows quaked, and those nymphs, that haunt marshes <lb/>
            and rivers, and flit about that water-meadow of the Ama­ <lb/>

            without one glance backward, till he was amongst his <lb/>
            comrades; and already Dawn, the child of morning, was <lb/>
            rising above snow-capped Caucasus and shedding his light <lb/>
            abroad.</p>
          <p>' In that hour Æetes buckled on his stiff 1 breast-plate, <lb/>
            which Ares gave him, after he had slain with his own <lb/>
            hand Phlegræan Mimas; and on his head he put a golden <lb/>
            helmet, with four plumes, blazing like the sun's round ball <lb/>
            of light, when he first rises from ocean. In one hand he <lb/>
            wielded, a buckler of many hides, in the other a sword, <lb/>
            dreadful, irresistible ; that blade could none of the heroes <lb/>
            have withstood, now that they had left Heracles far <lb/>
            behind; he alone could have stood up to battle against it. <lb/>
            And Phaethon' held his shapely chariot with the fleet <lb/>
            steeds nigh for him to mount; so he went up thereon and <lb/>
            took the reins in his hands. Forth from the town he <lb/>
            drave along the broad high-road, to take his station in the <lb/>
            lists, and with him a countless throng hasted forth. Like <lb/>
            as when Poseidon, mounted on his car, goeth to the <lb/>
            Isthmian games, or to Tænarus,3 or cometh in his might to <lb/>
            the waters of Lerna 4 or through the grove of Hyantian <lb/>
            Onchestus, and with his steeds he cometh even to Calaurea, <lb/>
            and the Hæmonian rock, or to wooded Geræstum; such <lb/>
            was Æetes, captain of the Colchians, for to behold.</p>

            sword all over; and his comrades around him tested his <lb/>

            bend that spear ever so little, but it remained hard and <lb/>
            unbroken as before in their stalwart hands. Then did <lb/>
            Idas, that son of Aphareus, in furious anger, hack the <lb/>
            butt end thereof with his mighty sword, but the edge <lb/>
            leapt from it like a hammer from an anvil, beaten back, <lb/>
            and the others, the heroes, cheered in their joy, with good <lb/>
            hope for his emprise. Next did he sprinkle himself as <lb/>
            well, and into him there entered fearful valiancy, mar­ <lb/>
            vellous, dauntless, and his hands on either side grew <lb/>
            stronger, swelling1 with might. As when a war-horse, <lb/>
            eager for the battle, leaps and neighs and paws the ground, <lb/>
            and in his pride pricks up his ears and rears his neck; in <lb/>
            like manner the son of Æson exulted in the strength of <lb/>
            his limbs. And oft he sprang into the air, hither and <lb/>
            thither, brandishing his shield of bronze and his ashen <lb/>
            spear in his hands. Thou wouldst have thought 'twas <lb/>
            lightning in winter-time, darting from the gloomy sky, and <lb/>
            leaping, flash on flash, from out the clouds, what time they <lb/>

          <p>Now would they hold back no longer from their enter­ <lb/>
            prise, but, sitting them in rows upon the benches, very <lb/>
            quickly they rowed to yon plain of Ares. Now it lay over <lb/>
            against the entrance to the town, as far therefrom as is the <lb/>

          <p>Forth leapt the son of Æson from the ship, with spear <lb/>
            and shield, unto his task, so soon as his crew had fastened <lb/>
            the cables; and with him he took a gleaming bronze <lb/>
            helmet, full of the sharp teeth, and his sword slung about <lb/>
            his shoulders, with naked1 body, somewhat resembling Ares, <lb/>
            and haply somewhat Apollo with his sword of gold. One <lb/>
            glance he took along the lea, and saw the bulls' brazen <lb/>
            yoke and the plough, made of one piece of ponderous <lb/>
            adamant, upon it. So he drew nigh, and fixed his strong <lb/>
            sword upright to the hilt2 hard by, and set the helmet down <lb/>
            resting against it. Then he set forward with shield alone, <lb/>
            tracking the countless traces of the bulls, and they from <lb/>
            some unseen den beneath the ground, where were their <lb/>
            strong stalls, all wrapt in smoke and flame, rushed forth <lb/>
            together, breathing flaming fire. Sore afraid were the <lb/>
            heroes at that sight; but he, firmly planting himself,3 <lb/>
            awaited their onset, as a reef of rock awaits the billows <lb/>
            driven against it by the countless blasts. And in front he <lb/>
            held his shield to meet them ; and they together bellowing, <lb/>
            smote thereon with their strong horns ; yet they heft him <lb/>
            up never a jot by their attack. As when the good leathern <note type="footnote"> honour of his dead friend Patroclus, and Vergil's account of games at <lb/>

            bellows of braziers now send forth a jet of flame through <lb/>
            the holes in the smelting pot,1 kindling a consuming <lb/>
            fire, and now again do cease their blast, while an awful <lb/>
            roar goeth up therefrom, when it darts up from below; <lb/>
            even so those two bulls did bellow as they breathed from <lb/>
            their mouths the rushing fire, and all about Jason ran the <lb/>
            consuming flame, striking him like lightning; but the <lb/>
            maiden's spells protected him. Then did he catch the ox <lb/>
            on his right hand by the top of his horn, and dragged him <lb/>
            with all his might and main, till he was near the brazen <lb/>
            yoke, and then he threw him down upon the ground on his <lb/>
            knees with one quick kick2 against his brazen hoof. In like <lb/>
            manner he tripped the other on his knees as he charged, <lb/>
            smitten with one stroke. And he cast from him his broad <lb/>
            shield on the earth, and kept those oxen twain where they <lb/>
            were fallen on their knees, stepping from side to side, now <lb/>
            here, now there, rushing headlong through the flame. But <lb/>
            Æetes marvelled at the might of the man. Meantime those <lb/>
            sons of Tyndarus,—for so had it been long before ordained <lb/>
            for them,--came near, and gave him the yoke from off the <lb/>

            upon their necks, and lifting the brazen pole between them, <lb/>
            made fast its pointed tip unto the yoke. Then those twain <lb/>
            started back from the fire toward the ship; but he once <lb/>

            and grasped the weighty helmet, full of sharp teeth, and <lb/>
            his resistless spear, wherewith, like some labourer with a <lb/>

            lest the fell crop of earth-born men should rise against him <lb/>
            ere he was done ; and on toiled those oxen, treading with <lb/>
            their brazen hoofs. Now when the third part of day, as it <lb/>
            waned from dawn, was still left, when swinked labourers <lb/>
            call the sweet unyoking hour to come to them at once, in <lb/>
            that hour the lea was finished ploughing by the tireless <lb/>
            ploughman, for all it was four plough-gates; and he <lb/>
            loosed the plough from the oxen, and scared them in <lb/>
            flight o'er the plain. Then went he again unto the ship, <lb/>
            while yet he saw the furrows free of the earth-born men. <lb/>
            And he drew of the river's stream in his helmet, and <lb/>
            quenched his thirst with water; and he bent his knees to <lb/>
            supple1 them, and filled his mighty soul with courage, eager <lb/>
            as a wild boar, that whets his tusks against the hunters, <lb/>
            while from his angry mouth the foam runs in great flakes <lb/>
            to the ground. Lo! now were those earth-born men spring­ <lb/>
            ing up o'er all the tilth, and the acre of Axes the death­ <lb/>
            dealer was all bristling with mighty shields and twy­ <lb/>

            to Olympus. As when, in the murk of night. after a heavy <lb/>
            storm of snow hath fallen on the earth, the winds do <lb/>
            scatter the wintry clouds once more, and all the heavenly <lb/>
            signs at once are seen shining through the gloom ; even so <lb/>
            those warriors shone as they grew up above the earth. But <lb/>
            Jason remembered the counsel of crafty Medea, and caught <lb/>
            up from the plain a great round rock, a fearful quoit for <lb/>
            Ares I the War-god ; four strong men could not have stirred <lb/>
            it ever so little from the ground. This did he take in his <lb/>
            hand, and threw it very far into their midst with one <lb/>
            swing, while himself did boldly couch beneath his shield. <lb/>
            And the Colchians gave a mighty cry, like the cry of the <lb/>
            sea when it roars on jagged rocks, but on the king Æetes <lb/>
            came dumb dismay at the hurtling of that mighty quoit. <lb/>
            Then did they like sharp-toothed 2 dogs leap upon it, and <lb/>
            with loud yells did rend each other; and they were falling <lb/>
            on their mother earth 'neath their own spears, like pines <lb/>
            or oaks, which sudden gusts of wind do shake. Like as <lb/>
            when a fiery meteor shoots from heaven, with a trail of <lb/>
            light behind, a marvel to mankind, whoso see it dart and <lb/>
            flash through the darkling air ; in such wise rushed the son <lb/>
            of Æson on. the earth-born men. and he bared his sword <lb/>
            from the scabbard, and smote them, mowing them down <lb/>
            one upon another, many in the belly and flanks as they <lb/>
            were but half risen to the air, and some in the legs as they <lb/>
            were rising, others just standing upright, and some as they <lb/>
            were even now hastening to the fray. As when some yeo­ <lb/>
            man, when a war hath broken out upon his boundaries, <lb/>
            fearful lest men will ravage his fields, seizes in his hand a <lb/>

            beams of the sun; even so did he then cut the crop of <lb/>
            earth-born men, and the furrows were filled with blood, as <lb/>
            the channels of a spring are filled with water. There they <lb/>
            fell; some on their faces, biting with their teeth the rough <lb/>
            clods ; some upon their backs ; others on the palms of their <lb/>
            hands and sides ; like sea-monsters in shape to behold. And <lb/>
            many wounded, or ever they had stept forth from the earth, <lb/>
            bowed their damp brows to the ground and rested there, <lb/>
            as much of them as had emerged to the air above. Even <lb/>

            OW tell, 0 Muse, child of Zeus, in thine own words, <lb/>
            the toil and plans of the Colchian maiden. For <lb/>
            very my mind within me is swayed perplexedly, as I <lb/>
            ponder thereon, whether I am to say, 'twas the sad out­ <lb/>
            come of bitter infatuation or unseemly panic, that made <lb/>
            her leave the tribes of the Colchians.</p>
          <p>Æetes, of a truth, amongst the chosen captains of his <lb/>
            people was devising sheer 1 treachery against the heroes all <lb/>
            night in his halls, in wild fury at the sorry ending of the <lb/>
            contest; and he was very sure, that angry sire, that these <lb/>
            things were not being accomplished without the aid of his <lb/>
            own daughters.</p>
          <p>But upon Medea's heart Hera cast most grievous fear, <lb/>
            and she trembled, like some nimble fawn, which the bark­ <lb/>
            ing of hounds hath frighted in the thickets of a deep wood­ <lb/>
            land. For anon she thought, that of a surety her help <lb/>
            would never escape her father's eye, and right soon would <lb/>
            she fill up her cup of bitterness. And she terrified her <lb/>
            handmaids, who were privy thereto ; and her eyes were full <lb/>
            of fire, and in her ears there rang a fearful sound; and oft <lb/>
            would she clutch at her throat, and oft tear the hair upon <lb/>
            her head and groan in sore anguish. Yea, and in that hour <lb/>
            would the maid have overleapt her doom and died of a <lb/>
            poisoned cup, bringing to nought the plans of Hera; but <lb/>
            the goddess drove her in panic to fly with the sons of <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">αἰπὺν</foreign>, strictly = steep, but metaphorically as here, " sheer, utter." <lb/>

            Phrixus. And her fluttering heart was comforted within <lb/>
            her. So she in eager haste poured from the casket all <lb/>
            her drugs at once into the folds of her bosom. And she <lb/>
            kissed her bed and the posts of the doors on either side, <lb/>
            and stroked the walls fondly, and with her hand cut off <lb/>
            one long tress and left it in her chamber, a memorial of <lb/>
            her girlish days for her mother ; then with a voice all <lb/>
            choked with sobs she wept aloud, " Ah, mother mine! I <lb/>
            leave thee here this one long tress instead of me, and go; <lb/>
            so take this last farewell as I go far from hence ; farewell <lb/>
            Chalciope, farewell to all my home! Would that the sea <lb/>
            had dashed thee, stranger, in pieces, or ever thou didst <lb/>
            reach the Colchian land! ’’</p>
          <p>So spake she, and from her eyes poured forth a flood of <lb/>
            tears. Even as a captive maid stealeth forth from a <lb/>
            wealthy house, one whom fate hath lately reft from her <lb/>
            country, and as yet knoweth she nought of grievous toil, <lb/>
            but a stranger to misery and slavish tasks, she cometh in <lb/>
            terror 'neath the cruel hands of a mistress; like her the <lb/>
            lovely maiden stole forth swiftly from her home. And the <lb/>
            bolts of the doors yielded of their own accord to her touch, <lb/>
            springing back at her hurried spells. With bare feet she <lb/>
            sped along the narrow paths, drawing her robe with her <lb/>
            left hand over her brows to veil her face and fair cheeks, <lb/>
            while with her right hand she lifted up the hem of her <lb/>
            garment. Swiftly along the unseen track she came in her <lb/>
            terror outside the towers of the spacious town, and none of <lb/>
            the guard marked her, for she sped on and they knew it <lb/>
            not. Then marked she well her way unto the temple, for <lb/>
            she was not ignorant of the paths, having wandered thither <lb/>
            oft aforetime in quest of corpses and the noxious roots of <lb/>
            the earth, as a sorceress must; yet did her heart quake <lb/>
            with fear and trembling. Now Titania, goddess of the <lb/>
            moon,1 as she sailed up the distant sky, caught sight of that <note type="footnote"> 1 The Moon was the child of Hyperion the Titan and Theia. </note> <lb/>

            maid distraught, and savagely she exulted o'er her in words <lb/>
            like these, " So I am not the only one to wander to the cave <lb/>
            on Latmos; not I alone burn with love for fair Endymion ! <lb/>
            How oft have I gone hence before thy cunning spells, with <lb/>
            thoughts of love, that thou mightest work in peace, in the <lb/>
            pitchy night, the sorceries so dear to thee. And now, I <lb/>
            trow, hast thou too found a like sad fate, and some god of <lb/>
            sorrow bath given thee thy Jason for a very troublous <lb/>
            grief. Well, go thy way ; yet steel thy heart to take up <lb/>
            her load of bitter woe, for all thy understanding."</p>
          <p>So spake she ; but her feet bare that other hasting on <lb/>
            her way. Right glad was she to climb the river's high <lb/>
            banks, and see before her the blazing fire, which all night <lb/>
            long the heroes kept up in joy for the issue of the enter­ <lb/>
            prise. Then through the gloom, with piercing voice, she <lb/>
            called aloud to Phrontis, youngest of the sons of Phrixus, <lb/>
            from the further bank ; and he, with his brethren and the <lb/>
            son of Æson too, deemed it was his sister's voice, and the <lb/>
            crew marvelled silently, when they knew what it really was. <lb/>
            Thrice she lifted up her voice, and thrice at the bidding of <lb/>
            his company cried Phrontis in answer to her ; and those <lb/>
            heroes the while rowed swiftly over to fetch her. Not yet <lb/>
            would they cast the ship's hawsers on the mainland, but <lb/>
            the hero Jason leapt quickly ashore from the deck above, <lb/>
            and with him Phrontis and Argus, two sons of Phrixus, <lb/>
            also sprang to land ; then did she clasp them by the knees <lb/>
            with both her hands, and spake : " Save me, friends, me <lb/>
            most miserable, aye, and yourselves as well from Æetes. <lb/>
            For ere now all is discovered, and no remedy cometh. <lb/>
            Nay, let us fly aboard the ship, before he mount his swift <note type="footnote"> 1 Latmos is a hill in Caria, where Endymion dwelt in a cave. He <lb/>
            had incurred the anger of Zeus by becoming enamoured of Hera, <lb/>
            wherefore he was condemned to sleep for ever; and the Moon saw him <lb/>
            asleep and was struck by his beauty, so that she came often to the <lb/>
            cavern on Latmos. </note> <pb n="152"/>

            horses. And I will give you the golden fleece, when I have <lb/>
            lulled the guardian snake to rest; but thou, stranger, now <lb/>
            amongst thy comrades take heaven to witness to the pro­ <lb/>
            mises thou didst make me, and make me not to go away <lb/>
            from hence in scorn and shame, for want of friends."</p>
          <p>So spake she in her sore distress, and the heart of the <lb/>
            son of Æson was very glad ; at once he gently raised her <lb/>
            up, where she was fallen at his knees, and took her in his <lb/>
            arms and comforted her, " God help thee, lady ! Be Zeus <lb/>
            of Olympus himself witness of mine oath, and Hera, queen <lb/>
            of marriage, bride of Zeus, that I will of a truth establish <lb/>
            thee as my wedded wife in my house, when we are come on <lb/>
            our return to the land of Hellas."</p>
          <p>So spake he, and therewith clasped her right hand in his <lb/>
            own. Then bade she them row the swift ship with all <lb/>
            speed unto the sacred grove, that they might take the fleece <lb/>
            and bear it away against the will of Æetes, while yet it was <lb/>
            night. Without delay deeds followed words; for they <lb/>
            made her embark, and at once thrust out the ship from the <lb/>
            shore ; and loud was the din, as the heroes strained at their <lb/>
            oars. But she, starting back, stretched her hands wildly <lb/>
            to the shore; but Jason cheered her with words, and stayed <lb/>
            her in her sore grief.</p>
          <p>In the hour when huntsmen 1 were shaking sleep from <lb/>
            their eyes, men who trust unto their hounds and never <lb/>
            sleep away the end part of the night, but shun the light <lb/>
            of dawn, lest it smite them too soon with its clear beams, <lb/>
            and efface the track and scent of the game ; in that hour <lb/>
            the son of Æson and the maiden stept from the ship into <lb/>
            a grassy spot, called " the Ram's couch," the spot where <lb/>
            first he rested his weary knees from bearing on his back <lb/>
            the Minyan son of Athamas. Nigh thereto are the founda­ <lb/>

            Phrixus, son of Æolus, did build to Zeus, who aideth <lb/>
            fugitives, offering that strange creature with his fleece of <lb/>
            gold, even as Hermes had bidden, when of his good will he <lb/>
            met him. There it was that the heroes set them down by <lb/>
            the counsel of Argus. So they twain went along the path <lb/>
            to the sacred grove, in quest of the wondrous oak, whereon <lb/>
            the fleece was hung, resting there like a cloud that turns <lb/>
            to red in the fiery beams of the rising sun. But right in <lb/>
            their way that serpent with his keen sleepless eyes, stretched <lb/>
            out his long neck, when he saw them coming, and horribly <lb/>
            he hissed, so that the long banks of the river and the <lb/>
            grove echoed strangely all around. Even they heard it, who <lb/>
            dwelt in the Colchian land very far from Titanian1 Æa by <lb/>
            the mouth of the Lycus, that stream that parteth from the <lb/>
            roaring river Araxes, and brings his sacred flood to join <lb/>
            the Phasis; and they twain flow on together and pour into <lb/>
            the Caucasian 2 sea. And women in their travail arose in <lb/>
            terror, and cast their arms in agony about their new-born <lb/>
            babes, who cried in their mothers' arms, trembling at the <lb/>
            serpent's hiss. As when, above smouldering wood, count­ <lb/>
            less sooty eddies of smoke do whirl, and one upon another <lb/>
            rises ever upward from below, hovering aloft in wreaths ; <lb/>
            so then that monster writhed his endless coils, covered <lb/>
            with hard dry scales. But, as he writhed, the maiden <lb/>
            came in sight, calling with sweet voice Sleep, highest3 of <lb/>
            gods, to her aid, to charm the fearsome beast; and she <lb/>
            called on the queen of the nether world, who roams by <lb/>
            night, to grant her a favourable enterprise. And the son <lb/>
            of Æson followed in fear. But lo ! that snake, charmed <lb/>
            by her voice, loosened the giant coil of his long spine, and <note type="footnote"> 1 The land was so called from the river Titan. </note><note type="footnote"> a i.e. the Euxine, into which the Phasis falls, so called from its vicinity <lb/>

            stretched out his countless folds, like a dark wave, dumb <lb/>
            and noiseless, rolling o'er a sluggish sea; but yet he held <lb/>
            his gruesome head on high, eager to seize them both in his <lb/>
            deadly jaws ; but the maiden dipt a spray of juniper just <lb/>
            cut in her thick broth, 1 and sprinkled charms unmixed <lb/>
            upon his eyes, chanting the while ; and all around him the <lb/>
            potent smell of the drug shed slumber, and he let his jaw <lb/>
            sink down upon that spot, and far behind him through the <lb/>
            trunks of the wood his endless coils were stretched. Then <lb/>
            did Jason take the golden fleece from the oak, at the <lb/>
            maiden's bidding; while she stood staunchly by him and <lb/>
            rubbed the beast's head with her drug, until the voice of <lb/>
            Jason bade her turn and come unto the ship, for he was <lb/>
            leaving the dusky grove of Ares. As a maiden catches on <lb/>
            her fine-wrought robe the rays of the moon at her full,2 <lb/>
            when she soareth above the high-roofed chamber, and her <lb/>
            heart within her rejoices at the sight of the lovely light; <lb/>
            so then was Jason glad, as he lifted the great fleece in his <lb/>
            hands, and o'er his sun-burnt cheeks and brow there <lb/>
            settled a flush as of flame from the flashing of the fleece; <lb/>
            as is the hide of a yearling ox, or of a hind which hunters <lb/>
            call a brocket, even such was the skin of the fleece,3 all <lb/>
            1 covered with gold and heavy with wool; and the ground <lb/>
            sparkled exceedingly before his feet as he went. On strode he <lb/>
            with it thrown now over his left shoulder, and hanging from <lb/>
            his neck above down to his feet, and now again would he <lb/>
            gather it up in his hands; for he feared exceedingly, lest <lb/>
            some god or man should meet him and take it from him.</p>
          <p>Dawn was spreading o'er the earth, when they came <note type="footnote"> I A thick hell-broth of magical drugs, such as the witches in <lb/>

            unto their company; and the young men were astonied at <lb/>
            sight of the great fleece, flashing like the lightning of <lb/>
            Zeus. And each man was eager to touch it and take it in <lb/>
            his hands. But the son of Æson checked them all, and <lb/>
            o'er it cast a new-made robe; then he took and set the <lb/>
            maiden on the stern, and thus spake amongst them all: <lb/>
            .. No longer, friends, shrink now from faring homeward. <lb/>
            For now is the need accomplished easily by the plans of <lb/>
            the maiden, for which we dared this grievous voyage in <lb/>
            toil and sorrow. Her of her own free will I will bear to my <lb/>
            home to be my wedded wife ; and do ye protect her, for <lb/>
            that she was a ready champion of all Achæa and of you. <lb/>
            For surely, an I think aright, Æetes will come to stop us <lb/>
            with an armed throng from getting sea-ward from out the <lb/>
            river. So one half of you throughout the ship row at the <lb/>
            oars, seated man by man, while the other half hold up your <lb/>
            oxhide shields before them, a ready defence against the darts <lb/>
            of the enemy, and fight ye for our return. For now, my <lb/>
            friends, we hold in our hands our children and our country <lb/>
            and our aged parents ; and the fate of Hellas hangeth on <lb/>
            our enterprise, to win deep shame or haply great renown.”</p>
          <p>So spake he, and did on his harness of war; and they <lb/>
            cried aloud, filled with a strange desire. But he drew his <lb/>
            sword from the scabbard and cut the stern-cables of the <lb/>
            ship, and nigh to the maiden he set himself to fight by 1 <lb/>
            the pilot Ancæus, with his helmet on his head; then on <lb/>
            sped the ship, as they basted to row her ever onward and <lb/>
            clear of the river.</p>
          <p>But now was Medea's love and her work known to proud <lb/>
            Æetes and to all the Colchians, and they gathered to the <lb/>
            assembly in their harness. Countless as the waves, that <lb/>

            leaves, that fall to earth through the wood with its thick <lb/>
            branches in the month when leaves are shed, and who <lb/>
            shall tell their number? in such countless throngs they <lb/>
            flocked along the river-banks, with eager cries; but their <lb/>
            king Æetes towered o'er all with his steeds in his shapely <lb/>
            car, those steeds which Helios did give him, swift as the <lb/>
            breath of the wind ; in his left hand he held his round <lb/>
            shield, and in the other a long pine-torch,1 and his huge <lb/>
            sword was ready drawn before him, and Absyrtus grasped <lb/>
            the reins of the horses. But the ship was cleaving her <lb/>
            way out to sea already, driven on by the stout rowers and <lb/>
            the downward current of the mighty river. Then the king <lb/>
            in sore distress raised his hands and called on Helios and <lb/>
            Zeus to witness their evil deeds ; and forthwith uttered he <lb/>
            fearful threats against all his people, if they should not <lb/>
            bring the maiden with their own hands, either upon shore or <lb/>
            finding the ship on the swell of the open sea, that he might <lb/>
            sate his eager soul with vengeance for all these things, <lb/>
            while they should know and endure in their own persons <lb/>
            all his fury and all his revenge.</p>
          <p>So spake JEetes, and on the self-same day the Colchians <lb/>
            launched their ships and put the tackling in them, and the <lb/>
            self-same day sailed out to sea; thou wouldst not have <lb/>
            thought it was a fleet of ships so much as a vast flight of <lb/>
            birds, screaming o'er the sea in flocks.</p>
          <p>Swift blew the wind by the counsels of the goddess <lb/>
            Hera, that so Ææan Medea might come most quickly to <lb/>
            the Pelasgian land to plague the house of Pelias ; and on <lb/>
            the third day at dawn they bound the cables of the ship <lb/>
            to the cliffs of the Paphlagones, at the mouth of the river <lb/>
            Halys ; for Medea bade them go ashore and appease Hecate <lb/>
            with sacrifice. Now that which the maiden did prepare <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">πεύκη</foreign>strictly = the fir-tree; then anything made of it, as here <lb/>

            and offer in sacrifice, let no man know, nor let my heart <lb/>
            urge me to sing thereof. I shudder to utter it. Verily <lb/>

            goddess, abideth from that day forth until now, for men <lb/>
            of later days to see.</p>
          <p>Anon the son of Æson minded him of Phineus, and <lb/>
            likewise did the other heroes, how that he told them they <lb/>
            should find a different course from Æa, but his meaning <lb/>
            was hidden from them all. But to their eager ears did <lb/>
            Argus made harangue: " Let us now to Orchomenus, <lb/>
            whither that unerring seer, whom ye met aforetime, fore­ <lb/>

            Arcadians, those Arcadians who are said to have lived before <lb/>

            trusting in the might and strength of his people and in <lb/>
            his own courage; and, as he went, he founded many a <lb/>
            town, some whereof men haply still inhabit, and some <lb/>
            maybe no longer; for many a long age hath passed since <lb/>
            then.</p>
          <p>But Æa still abides steadfast, and the children of those <lb/>
            men, whom that king did plant therein to dwell there ; <lb/>
            these men preserve writings of their fathers, graved upon <lb/>
            pillars, whereon are all the ways and limits of sea and <lb/>
            dry land, far and wide, for those who come thither. Now <lb/>
            there is a river, farthest branch of Ocean, broad and very <lb/>
            deep for e'en a merchant ship to pass thereon; they call it <lb/>
            Ister,1 and far away they have traced it on their chart; for <lb/>
            a while it cleaveth through the boundless tilth in one <lb/>
            solitary stream, for its springs roar and seethe far away <lb/>
            beyond the north wind's breath in the Rhipæan mountains.</p>
          <p>But when it enters the boundaries of Thrace and Scythia, <lb/>
            thenceforth in two streams it pours one half its waters by <lb/>
            one channel into the Ionian sea, while the residue it sends, <lb/>
            after the division, through a deep bay that openeth into <lb/>

            their appointed path. For before them went a trail of <lb/>
            heavenly radiance, where they might pass. So there they <lb/>
            left the son of Lycus, and sailed in gladness of heart across <lb/>

            Paphlagones. But they did not round Carambis, for <lb/>
            the winds and the blaze of heavenly fire abode with them, <lb/>
            till they entered Ister's mighty stream.</p>
          <p>Now some of the Colchians, after a vain search, had <lb/>
            sailed through the Cyanean rocks into Pontus, while others <lb/>
            had made for the river under the command of Absyrtus, <lb/>
            and he had withdrawn a space and entered the fair <lb/>
            mouth." So he had just anchored before them beyond a <lb/>
            neck of land inside the furthest bay of the Ionian sea; for <lb/>
            Ister floweth round an island by name Peuce, triangular <lb/>
            in shape, with its base unto the sea shore, and a narrow <lb/>
            angle toward the river's stream; around it the river <lb/>
            branches into two channels. One they call the mouth of <lb/>
            Narex, the other below the bottom of the island, call they <lb/>
            the " fair mouth " ; and here it was that Absyrtus and his <lb/>
            Colchians put in and anchored in haste; while the heroes <lb/>
            sailed further up-stream to the top of the island. And in <lb/>
            the water-meads the shepherds of the country left good <lb/>
            store of sheep, in fear of the ships, for they thought them <lb/>
            monsters coming forth from the teeming deep. For they <lb/>
            had never seen sea-faring ships anywhere before, nor yet <lb/>
            had the Scythians, who are mixed with the Thracians, nor <lb/>
            the Sigynni, nor yet the Graucenii, nor the Lindi who <lb/>
            dwell next to these on the great Laurian steppes.</p>
          <p>Now when they had passed by the mountain of Anchurus <lb/>
            and the rock of Cauliacus, a little space from that moun­ <lb/>

            full tide this way and that, and past that Laurian plain ; <lb/>
            then did the Colchians go forth into the Cronian 1 sea, and <lb/>
            cut off all the routes that they might not escape them. <lb/>
            But the heroes reached the river after them, and passed <lb/>
            close to the two Brygean2 isles of Artemis, where on the <note type="footnote"> 1 The Adriatic, so called because Cronos had lived upon its shores. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Βρυγηίδας</foreign>. The Brygians were a savage Thracian tribe, worship­ <lb/>

            one was a sacred building, and on the other they did land, <lb/>
            being ware of the host of Absyrtus ; for the Colchians had <lb/>
            left those islands within the river void of cities as they were, <lb/>
            in awe of the daughter of Zeus ; though the others, which <lb/>
            guarded the passages to the sea, were crowded with their <lb/>
            folk; and so it was that Absyrtus left his host upon the <lb/>
            headlands, nigh to the isles, between the river Salangon <lb/>
            and the Thracian 1 land.</p>
          <p>There would the handful of Minyæ have yielded then in <lb/>
            pitiful fray to their more numerous foes; but ere that they <lb/>
            made a treaty and covenant, avoiding the dire quarrel; <lb/>
            they were still to keep fairly the golden fleece, since Æetes <lb/>
            himself had so promised them, if they should fulfil their <lb/>
            tasks, whether they did wrest it from him by guile or <lb/>
            haply in the open, against his will; but for Medea,—for <lb/>
            there was the quarrel,-they were to. deliver her to the <lb/>
            virgin child of Leto apart from their company, until one of <lb/>
            the kings, that defend justice, should decide whether she <lb/>
            must go again unto her father's house, or follow the <lb/>
            chieftains to the land of Hellas.</p>
          <p>Now when the maiden inly mused on each thing, verily <lb/>
            sharp anguish shook her heart unceasingly, and she called <lb/>
            Jason apart from his crew and led him aside, till they were <lb/>
            far withdrawn; then to his face she told her piteous tale, <lb/>
            " Son of Æson, what is this purpose ye design together <lb/>

            ye await in this your bitter covenant, should decide that I <lb/>
            am my brother's. How shall I come before my father ? <lb/>
            Will not my fame be passing fair ? what vengeance, what <lb/>
            grievous torture shall I not endure in agony for the awful <lb/>
            deeds that I have done ? and thou, shalt thou find the <lb/>
            return thou longest for ? No, that may the bride of Zeus, <lb/>
            queen of the world, in whom is thy joy, never bring to <lb/>
            pass! And some day mayest thou remember even me, <lb/>
            when thou art racked with anguish; and may the fleece, <lb/>
            like a dream, float away from thee into darkness on the <lb/>
            wings of the wind. Yea, and may my avenging spirit <lb/>
            chase thee anon from thy fatherland; so terrible is my <lb/>
            fate through thy cruelty. Nor is it ordained that these <lb/>
            curses fall fruitless to the ground, for thou hast sinned <lb/>
            indeed against a mighty oath, without pity; nay, ye shall <lb/>
            not long at your ease wink the eye in mockery of me here­ <lb/>
            after, for all your covenant."</p>
          <p>So spake she, in the heat of her vehement rage; for she <lb/>
            was longing to fire the ship, and tear it all asunder, and then <lb/>
            to throw herself upon the devouring flame. But Jason, <lb/>
            though somewhat afraid, made answer thus with soothing <lb/>
            words: " God help thee, lady ! stay thine hand. These <note type="footnote"> M </note> <pb n="162"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BOOK IV."/><lb/>
            things are not after mine own heart. But we seek some delay <lb/>
            from the conflict, so thick is the cloud of furious foes <lb/>
            around us for thy sake. For all who dwell in this land <lb/>
            are eager to help Absyrtus, that they may bring thee home <lb/>
            again unto thy father, like some captive maid. And we, if <lb/>
            we meet them in battle, shall all be slain ourselves by a <lb/>
            hateful doom; and that surely will be a grief yet more <lb/>
            bitter, if we die and leave thee a prey in their hands. Now <lb/>
            this our covenant shall accomplish a cunning wile, whereby <lb/>
            we will bring Absyrtus to destruction. And they who dwell <lb/>
            around will never come against us for thy sake after all, to <lb/>
            pleasure the Colchians, without their prince, who is both <lb/>
            thy champion and thy brother; nor will I shrink from <lb/>
            fighting them face to face, if so be they will not let us sail <lb/>
            forth."</p>
          <p>So spake he, soothing her; but she let fall a deadly1 <lb/>
            speech: " Hearken now. Needs must one in sorry case <lb/>
            devise a sorry plan ; for at the first was I led astray by a <lb/>
            mistake, and evil were the desires I had from heaven. Do <lb/>
            thou in the turmoil ward off from me the spears of the <lb/>
            Colchians, and I will entice him2 to come into your hands, <lb/>
            and do thou welcome him with gladdening gifts, if haply I <lb/>
            can persuade the heralds to depart and bring him all by <lb/>
            himself to agree to my proposals. Then, if this deed is to <lb/>
            thy mind, slay him and join in fray with the Colchians; <lb/>
            'tis nought to me."</p>
          <p>So they twain agreed and planned great treachery against <lb/>
            Absyrtus, and they gave him many a gift for stranger's <lb/>
            welcome, and amongst them that dark robe divine of Hyp­ <lb/>
            sipyle ; the robe which the goddess Graces had made with <lb/>
            their own hands for Dionysus in sea-girt Naxos, and he <lb/>
            gave it afterwards to his son Thoas, who left it in turn <note type="footnote"> 1 i.e. a speech that would bring death to someone—in this case to <lb/>

             <note type="correspondsTo" n="L. 396-457.]"/><lb/>
            to Hypsipyle, and she gave that robe too, a fair-wrought <lb/>
            stranger's gift with many another wonder, unto the son of <lb/>
            Æson for to take with him. Never wouldst thou satisfy <lb/>
            thy sweet longing in stroking it or gazing thereupon. And <lb/>
            . the smell thereof was likewise wondrous sweet, from the <lb/>
            day on which the prince of Nysa 1 himself lay down thereon, <lb/>
            flushed with wine and nectar, with the fair form of Minos' <lb/>
            daughter in his arms, whom on a day Theseus had left in <lb/>
            the isle of Naxos, when she followed him from Crete.</p>
          <p>Now when Medea had declared her meaning to the <lb/>
            heralds, so as to persuade them to depart, as soon as <lb/>
            Absyrtus came by agreement to the temple of the goddess <lb/>
            and night's black pall was over all, that so she might de­ <lb/>
            vise with him a cunning plan whereby to take the fleece of <lb/>
            gold, and come again unto the house of Æetes ; for, said <lb/>
            she, the sons of Phrixus gave her by force unto the <lb/>
            strangers to bear away. Thus did she persuade them, <lb/>
            sprinkling the air and the breeze with magic drugs, such <lb/>
            as can draw the wild beast from the pathless hill, be he <lb/>
            never so far away.</p>
          <p>O cruel Love, man's chief est bane and curse ! from thee <lb/>
            proceed deadly feuds and mourning and lamentation; yea, <lb/>
            and countless sorrows beside all these are by thee stirred <lb/>
            up. TJp, and arm thee against the foemen's sons, thou <lb/>
            deity, as in the day thou didst inspire Medea, with her fell <lb/>
            murderous thoughts. But how did she slay Absyrtus by <lb/>
            an evil doom when he came to her ? For that must our <lb/>
            song tell next.</p>
          <p>When they had left her in the isle of Artemis, as had <lb/>
            been agreed, then did these anchor their ships apart from <lb/>
            one another; but that prince, Jason, went unto an ambush <lb/>
            to await Absyrtus and his company. But he, tricked by <lb/>
            their promises so dire for him, rowed quickly in his ship <note type="footnote"> 1 Dionysus, who found Ariadne on the island of Naxos, after her <lb/>
            desertion by Theseus. </note> <pb n="164"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BOOK IV."/><lb/>
            across the gulf of sea, as the night grew dark, and landed <lb/>
            on the sacred isle. Straight on his way he went alone, and <lb/>
            made trial of his sister with words, even as a tender child <lb/>
            tries a torrent in winter, which not even strong men can <lb/>
            pass; if haply she would devise some guile against the <lb/>
            strangers. So they twain agreed together on all points, <lb/>
            when on a sudden the son of Æson leapt from the thick <lb/>
            ambush, clutching in his hand a naked sword; quickly the <lb/>
            maiden turned away her eyes, covering them with her veil, <lb/>
            that she might not see the blood of her brother when he <lb/>
            was smitten. Him did Jason strike from his ambuscade, <lb/>
            as a butcher strikes a mighty bull with strong horns, hard <lb/>
            by the temple, which the Brygians, who dwell on the main­ <lb/>
            land opposite, once had built for Artemis. There at its <lb/>
            threshold he fell upon his knees, but as the hero breathed <lb/>
            out his soul with his dying breath, he caught up in his <lb/>
            hands black blood from the wound, and dyed with crimson <lb/>
            his sister's silvery veil and robe, as she shrunk from him. <lb/>
            But a pitiless spirit of vengeance, irresistible, gave one <lb/>
            quick look askance at the murderous deed they wrought. <lb/>
            Then the hero, the son of Æson, first cut off some limbs' of <lb/>
            the murdered man, and thrice licked up some blood, and <lb/>
            thrice spat the pollution from his mouth, for so must they <lb/>
            make expiation who have murdered a man by treachery. <lb/>
            Then he buried the clammy corpse in the ground, where <lb/>
            to this day lie his bones amongst the Absyrtians.2</p>
          <p>In the same hour the heroes, seeing before them a. <lb/>

            to cross, laid their ship alongside the Colchian barque, and <lb/>
            slew the crew thereof, as hawks drive flocks of doves in <lb/>
            confusion, or fierce lions a great flock of sheep, when they <lb/>
            have leapt upon the fold. Not one of them escaped death, <lb/>
            but they fell on the whole crew, destroying them as fire <lb/>
            doth; at the last came Jason up, eager to help them, but <lb/>
            they had no need of his succour; but were already anxious <lb/>
            on his account. Then they sat them down and took sage <lb/>
            counsel about the voyage ; and as they mused thereon <lb/>
            came the maiden to join them, and Peleus first made <lb/>
            harangue: " Lo ! I bid you embark now, while it is yet <lb/>
            night, upon the ship, and take the passage opposite to that <lb/>
            which the enemy hold ; for at dawn, as soon as they per­ <lb/>
            ceive all, methinks there is no argument which will urge <lb/>
            them to pursue us further, so as to prevail with them; <lb/>
            but they will part asunder in grievous quarrels, as men do <lb/>
            who have lost their king. And when once the folk are <lb/>
            divided, 'twill be an easy route for us, or indeed for any <lb/>
            who come hither hereafter."</p>
          <p>So spake he, and the young men approved the word <lb/>
            of the son of Æacus. So they went quickly aboard and <lb/>
            bent to their oars unceasingly, until they came to the <lb/>
            sacred isle of Electra, chiefest of isles, nigh to the river <lb/>
            Eridanus.</p>
          <p>Now the Colchians when they learnt the death of their <lb/>
            prince, were right eager to search the Cronian sea through­ <lb/>
            out for Argo and the Minyæ. But Hera restrained them <lb/>
            by fearful thunderings and lightnings from the sky. And <lb/>
            they ended by being afraid of their own homes in the <lb/>
            Cytæan land for fear of Æetes’ savage fury. So they came <lb/>
            to land in different places and settled there securely. <lb/>
            Some landed on those very islands, on which the heroes <lb/>
            had halted ; and there they dwell, called after Absyrtus ; <lb/>
            others built a fenced city by the deep black stream of the <lb/>
            Ulyrian river, where is the tomb of Harmonia and Cadmus, <pb n="166"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BOOK IV."/><lb/>
            settling amongst the Encheleans; and others dwell upon <lb/>
            the mountains, which are called " the Thunderers," from <lb/>
            the day that the thunder of Zeus the son of Cronos <lb/>
            stayed them from going to the island over against them.</p>
          <p>But the heroes, when now their return seemed assured <lb/>
            them, did then bind their cables on the shore of the <lb/>
            Hylleans and go forth. For there be groups of islands scat­ <lb/>
            tered there, making the passage through them hard for <lb/>
            sailors. But the Hylleans no more devised enmity against <lb/>
            them, as before; but of themselves did further their <lb/>
            voyage, getting as their guerdon Apollo's mighty tripod. <lb/>
            For Phoebus gave to the son of Æson tripods twain, to <lb/>
            carry to that far country, when he journeyed thither in <lb/>
            obedience to an oracle, on the day when he came to sacred <lb/>
            Pytho to enquire about this very voyage; and it was <lb/>
            ordained that wheresoever these were set up, that land <lb/>
            should never be ravaged by the attack of foemen. Where­ <lb/>
            fore to this day that tripod is buried in yon land near the <lb/>
            pleasant city of Hyllus, deep beneath the soil, that it may <lb/>
            ever be hidden from mortal ken.</p>
          <p>But they found not king Hyllus still living there, whom <lb/>
            comely Melite bare to Heracles in the land of the Phæa­ <lb/>
            cians. For Heracles came hither to the house of Nausithous <lb/>
            and to Macris, the nurse of Dionysus, to wash away the awful <lb/>
            murder of his children; there did that hero vanquish in <lb/>
            love's warfare the daughter of the river Ægæus, Melite, the <lb/>
            water-nymph, and she bare strong Hyllus. But he, when <lb/>
            he grew up, cared not to abide in the island itself, under <lb/>
            the eye of Nausithous, its prince, but went o'er the Cronian <lb/>
            sea, having gathered to him the people of the Phæacians <lb/>
            who dwelt there; for the hero Nausithous helped him on <lb/>
            his way; there did he settle, and was slain by the <lb/>
            Mentores, as he stood up to do battle for the oxen of his <lb/>
            field.</p>
          <p>But, ye goddesses, how came Argo's wondrous pennon in <pb n="167"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="L. 518-578.]."/><lb/>
            clear view outside the sea, about the Ausonian 1 land and the <lb/>
            Ligystian islands, which are called " the line of isles ? " <lb/>
            what need, what business brought her so far away ? what <lb/>
            breezes bare them hither ?</p>
          <p>Zeus, I trow, the king of gods, was seized with fury at <lb/>
            their deed, when Absyrtus was mightily o’erthrown ; but <lb/>
            yet he ordained that they should wash away the guilt <lb/>
            of blood by the counsels of Ææan Circe, and after first en­ <lb/>
            during countless woes should return. Now none of the <lb/>
            chieftains was ware thereof; but starting from the land of <lb/>
            Hyllus they hasted far on their way, and they left on the <lb/>
            lee those islands of the Liburni that lie in order on the sea, <lb/>
            peopled formerly by Colchians, Issa and Dusceladus and <lb/>
            lovely Pityeia. And, next to them, they came unto Corcyra, <lb/>
            where Poseidon had settled the daughter of Asopus, Cor­ <lb/>
            cyra of the fair tresses, far from the land of Phlius, whence <lb/>
            he had snatched her in his love; and sailors, seeing it rise <lb/>
            darkly from the main with black woodland all around, do <lb/>
            call it Corcyra the Black. Next passed they Melite, <lb/>
            rejoicing greatly at the gentle breeze, and steep Cerossus, <lb/>
            and Nymphæa on the far horizon, where queen Calypso, <lb/>
            daughter of Atlas, had her home; and lo! they deemed <lb/>
            they saw the shadowy " hills of thunder." Then was Hera <lb/>
            ware of the angry counsels and the heavy wrath of Zeus for <lb/>
            their sake; and forasmuch as she was planning the fulfilment <lb/>
            of that voyage, she did stir up head-winds,2 whereby they <lb/>
            were caught and carried back upon the rocky isle of Electra. <note type="footnote"> 1 ’<foreign xml:lang="grc">Αυσονίην</foreign>, i.e. Italy. As a matter of fact, Apollonius is guilty of <lb/>

            Anon from out the hollow ship, in mid course, the oaken <lb/>
            beam from Dodona, which Athene had fitted down the <lb/>
            middle of the keel, found a tongue and cried out in human <lb/>
            voice. And deadly fear came on them as they heard the <lb/>
            voice, that told of Zeus's grievous wrath. For it said they <lb/>
            should not escape a passage o'er a lengthy sea, nor troublous <lb/>
            tempests, unless Circe purged them of the ruthless murder <lb/>
            of Absyrtus; and it bade Polydeuces and Castor pray to the <lb/>
            deathless gods to grant a passage first across the Ausonian <lb/>
            sea, wherein they should find Circe, daughter of Perse and <lb/>
            Helios.</p>
          <p>So cried Argo in the gloom ; and they, the sons of Tyn­ <lb/>
            darus, arose, and raised their hands to the immortals, <lb/>
            praying for each and all; for deep dismay was come upon <lb/>
            the other Minyan heroes. But the ship sped on apace; <lb/>
            and they entered far into the stream of Eridanus, where on <lb/>
            a day Phaethon, smitten through the breast with a blazing <lb/>
            bolt, fell scorched from the chariot of Helios into the mouth <lb/>
            of that deep sheet of water, and it belches forth heavy. <lb/>
            clouds of steam from his wound that still is smouldering. <lb/>
            No bird can spread his light pinions and cross that water, <lb/>
            but half-way it flutters and then plunges in the flame. <lb/>
            Round about the daughters of the Sun sadly raise their <lb/>
            dirge of woe, as they dance round the tall poplars; and from <lb/>
            their eyes they shed upon the ground bright drops of amber, <lb/>
            which dry up on the sand beneath the sun's heat; but when <lb/>
            the swollen billows of the dark mere do dash against the <lb/>
            rocks before the blast of the noisy wind, then are they <lb/>

            And the Celts have set this legend to them, how that they <note type="footnote"> 1 The daughters of the Sun are represented as ever weeping for the <lb/>

            .radiant heaven at the chiding of his father, wroth at the <lb/>
            slaying of his son, whom divine Coronis bare in rich <lb/>
            Lacereia by the mouth of the Amyrus. So runs the legend <lb/>
            ’mongst those folk. But these felt no desire for meat or <lb/>
            drink, nor did their spirit turn to mirth. But all day, <lb/>
            I trow, were they worn out and grievously weakened by the <lb/>
            foul stench, which the streams of Eridanus sent up unceas­ <lb/>
            ingly from smouldering Phaethon; and all night too <lb/>
            they heard the shrill lament of the daughters of the Sun, <lb/>
            loudly wailing; and as they mourned their tears were <lb/>
            borne along the waters, as it were drops of oil.</p>
          <p>Thence they entered the deep stream of Bhodanus, <lb/>
            which comes to join the Eridanus; and at their meeting <lb/>
            doth the water roar in wild commotion. Now that river, <lb/>
            rising in a land very far away, where are the portals and <lb/>
            . the habitation of Night, doth pour himself on one side <lb/>
            upon the ocean's cliffs, on another doth he fall into the <lb/>
            Ionian sea, while by yet a third channel he casts his <lb/>
            stream through seven mouths into the Sardinian sea and <lb/>
            its boundless bay. Thence they sailed into stormy lakes, <lb/>
            which open out along the vast mainland of the Celts, and <lb/>
            there would they have met with a foul mishap. For a <lb/>
            certain off-stream was bearing them into the ocean-gulf, <lb/>
            and. they not knowing were about to sail thereinto; <lb/>
            whence they would never have won a safe return. But <lb/>
            Hera sped forth from heaven and shouted from the <lb/>
            Hercynian rock; and one and all did quake with fear at <lb/>
            her shout, for terribly rumbled the wide firmament. So <note type="footnote"> I Apollo left Olympus and went to live among the Hyperboreans, <lb/>
            the most remote of men, when Zeus had slain his son Æsculapius, <lb/>

            they turned back before the goddess, noting now the way <lb/>
            along which they must go for their return. At last they <lb/>
            reached the sea-coast by the counsels of Hera, passing <lb/>
            through the coasts of countless Celtic and Ligyan tribes, <lb/>
            without being attacked. For about them the goddess <lb/>
            shed a thick mist all day as they went. So they sailed <lb/>
            through the river's midmost mouth and came unto " the <lb/>
            line of islands," saved through the intercession of the sons <lb/>
            of Zeus; wherefore are altars and temples builded there <lb/>
            for ever, for it was not that voyage alone they did attend <lb/>
            to succour; but to them Zeus vouchsafed to aid the ships <lb/>
            also of future mariners. After leaving the line of <lb/>
            islands" they sailed to the isle of Æthalia, and there1 <lb/>
            upon its shingly beach they wiped off in the lists much <lb/>
            sweat; and the pebbles on the strand were strewn as it <lb/>
            were with skin; and there lie their quoits and tattered <lb/>
            raiment, wondrous many; so that the harbour therein is <lb/>
            called Argo's haven after them.</p>
          <p>Quickly they sailed thence across the ocean swell with <lb/>
            their eyes upon the Tyrsenian cliffs of Ausonia, and came <lb/>
            unto the famous harbour of Ææa, and they drew nigh and <lb/>
            fastened the ship's hawsers on the rocks. There they <lb/>
            found Circe washing her head in the sea-water, for greatly <lb/>
            was she scared by the visions of the night. Her chamber <lb/>
            and the walls of her house seemed to be all running with <lb/>
            blood, and fire was devouring her store of drugs, where­ <lb/>
            with afore she bewitched strangers, whoso came hither; <lb/>
            and she did quench the fire's bright blaze with blood of <note type="footnote"> 1 It is far from clear what the meaning of these lines is. If we sup­ <lb/>

            murdered men, scooping it up in her hands; and so she <lb/>
            ceased from deadly fear.1 Wherefore so soon as dawn was <lb/>
            come, she arose and would wash her hair and raiment in <lb/>
            the waters of the sea. And beasts, that resembled not <lb/>
            ravening brutes of prey, nor yet had the form of men, but <lb/>
            each wore his fellow's limbs in medley strange, came <lb/>
            trooping forth, like sheep when they throng from the fold <lb/>
            at the heels of the shepherd. Such creatures earth herself <lb/>
            produced from the primeval mud,2 compact of divers kinds <lb/>
            of limbs, when as yet she was not made solid by the <lb/>
            thirsty air, nor yet had gotten one drop of moisture from <lb/>
            the rays of the scorching sun; but time put these forms <lb/>
            together and led them forth in rows; e'en such were the <lb/>
            shapeless things that followed her. And exceeding wonder <lb/>
            seized the heroes ; and anon, as each man gazed upon the <lb/>
            form and face of Circe, easily he guessed she was a sister <lb/>
            of Æetes.</p>
          <p>Now when she had sent from her the terror of her <lb/>
            dream by night, at once she started back again, and she <lb/>
            bade them follow her in her subtlety, caressing them with <lb/>
            her hand. Now his company abode there steadfastly at <lb/>
            the bidding of the son of Æson, but he took with him the <lb/>
            Colchian maiden; and they twain went with her along the <lb/>
            road, until they came to the hall of Circe; then that lady <lb/>
            bade them sit on fair seats, in great amaze at their coming. <lb/>
            But those twain without a word or sound darted to her <lb/>

            flame were successful and so she ceased to be afraid, or whether her <lb/>
            terror was so acute that she stopped from what she was doing in con­ <lb/>
            sequence, is hard to determine. The Greek is in favour of the first <lb/>

            Jason fixed his great hilted sword in the ground, where­ <lb/>
            with he slew the son of Æetes, but his eye would never <lb/>
            look her full in the face. In that moment Circe knew, <lb/>
            'twas murder and blood-guiltiness from which they fled. <lb/>
            Wherefore in reverence for the ordinance of Zeus, the sup­ <lb/>
            pliants' god, who is a very jealous god, yet mightily suc­ <lb/>
            coureth murderers, she offered the sacrifice, wherewith <lb/>
            ruthless suppliants purify themselves when they come to <lb/>
            the altar. First, to release them from the unatoned <lb/>
            bloodshed, she held above their heads the young of a sow, <lb/>
            whose dugs were still full of milk after her litter, and <lb/>
            wetted their hands in the blood when she had cut its <lb/>
            skin ; next made she atonement with other libations, call­ <lb/>
            ing on Zeus the while to purify them; for he is the <lb/>
            champion of blood-guilty suppliants. And all that she <lb/>
            used in the cleansing did attendant nymphs, who brought <lb/>
            each thing to her, bear forth from the house. But she <lb/>
            within stood by the hearth and burned thereon, praying <lb/>
            the while, a soothing sop of honey, oil, and meal with <lb/>
            nought of wine1 therein, that she might stay the grim <lb/>
            spirits of vengeance from their fury, and that Zeus might <lb/>
            be propitious and favourable to them both, whether they <lb/>
            sought atonement for hands defiled with a stranger's <lb/>
            blood or haply for a kinsman, themselves his kith and <lb/>
            kin.</p>
          <p>Now when all her task was duly done, then did she <lb/>
            raise them up, and seated them on polished chairs, and <lb/>
            herself sat near facing them. And straightway she ques­ <lb/>
            tioned them straitly of their business and their voyage, <lb/>
            and whence they came to her land and house, to sit them <lb/>
            down as suppliants in such wise. For lo! a hideous re- <note type="footnote"> 1 Offerings to the Eumenides must contain no wine, being composed <lb/>

            membrance of her dream came o'er her, as her heart <lb/>
            mused thereon; and she yearned to hear the voice of the <lb/>
            maiden, her kinswoman, soon as ever she saw her lift her <lb/>
            eyes from the ground. For all the race of Helios was <lb/>
            manifest at sight, for they shot far in front of them a <lb/>
            gleam, as it had been of gold, from the twinkling of their <lb/>
            eyes. Then did she, the daughter of grave Æetes, make <lb/>
            soft answer in the Colchian tongue to all her questioning, <lb/>
            telling of the expedition and the journey of the heroes, <lb/>
            and all their suffering in their hurried toils, and how she <lb/>
            had sinned at the bidding of her sorrowing sister, and <lb/>
            how she fled with the sons of Phrixus from the awful <lb/>
            horrors her father might inflict; but of the murder of <lb/>
            Absyrtus she was careful not to speak. But nowise did it <lb/>
            escape the ken of Circe; yet for all that she pitied the <lb/>
            weeping maiden, and thus unto her said, " Unhappy girl! <lb/>
            verily an evil and a shameful return thou hast devised. <lb/>
            No long time, I trow, shalt thou escape Æetes’ fearful <lb/>
            wrath; for soon will he go even to the homes in the land <lb/>
            of Hellas, to take vengeance for the murder of his son; <lb/>
            seeing that thou hast wrought a terrible deed. But, for­ <lb/>
            asmuch as thou art my suppliant and of my race, I will <lb/>
            devise no further evil against thee at thy coming hither; <lb/>
            but get thee from my house in company with this stranger, <lb/>
            this fellow whom thou hast taken unbeknown to thy <lb/>
            father; entreat me not, sitting at my hearth, for I will <lb/>
            not consent to thy counsels and thy shameful flight."</p>
          <p>So spake she; and grievous sorrow laid hold upon <lb/>
            Medea, and she wrapt her robe about her eyes and wept; <lb/>
            till the hero took her by the hand and led her forth to the <lb/>
            door of the hall, quivering with terror; so they left the <lb/>
            house of Circe.</p>
          <p>But they escaped not the knowledge of the wife of Zeus, <lb/>
            the son of Cronos; but Iris told her, when she marked <lb/>
            them going from the hall. For Hera bade her watch them <pb n="174"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BOOK IV."/><lb/>
            closely, until they came unto the ship, and again she spake <lb/>
            and hailed her, " Dear Iris, now, if ever thou hast accom­ <lb/>
            plished my bidding, come, speed thee on swift wings <lb/>
            and bid Thetis arise from out the deep, and come hither <lb/>
            to me. For need of her aid is come upon me ; and next <lb/>
            get thee to the cliffs, where the brazen anvils of Hephæstus <lb/>
            clang to the blows of his heavy hammers, and bid him lull <lb/>
            his fiery blasts to rest, until Argo has sailed by those cliffs. <lb/>
            Then go to Æolus, Æolus who rules the wind, children of <lb/>
            the upper air, and tell him this my mind, that he make all <lb/>
            wind to cease under heaven, and suffer no breeze to <lb/>
            roughen the sea; only let a favouring west-wind blow, <lb/>
            that the heroes may come to the Phæacian isle of <lb/>
            Alcinous."</p>
          <p>So spake she ; and forthwith Iris darted from Olympus, <lb/>
            cleaving her way, with her light wings outspread. And <lb/>
            she plunged into the Ægean sea, just where the home of <lb/>
            Nereus is. And she came to Thetis first, and told her <lb/>
            tale as Hera bade, and roused her to go to her. Next went <lb/>
            she to Hephæstus; and quickly stayed him from his iron <lb/>
            hammers, and his sooty bellows ceased from their blast. <lb/>
            Lastly came she to Æolus, famous son of Hippotas. And <lb/>
            even while she was telling him her message, and resting <lb/>
            her swift knees from her course, did Thetis leave Nereus <lb/>
            and her sisters and go from the sea to Olympus, unto the <lb/>
            goddess Hera, who made her sit beside her, and declared <lb/>
            her speech ; " Hearken now, lady Thetis, to that which I <lb/>
            fain would tell thee. Thou knowest how dear to my heart <lb/>
            is the hero son of Æson, and those others that do help him <lb/>
            in his toil; for 'twas I alone, that saved them in their <lb/>

            rock of Scylla, and Charybdis, horribly belching. Nay, <lb/>
            hear me ; for lo ! 'twas I that with mine own hands tended <lb/>
            and caressed thee from thine infancy above all others, who <lb/>
            dwell within the sea, because thou wouldst not yield to <lb/>
            the importunities of Zeus. For he is ever bent on such <lb/>
            deeds, to lie with women, be they mortal or immortal. <lb/>
            But thou, from reverence of me and from fear, didst avoid <lb/>
            him; wherefore he then did swear a mighty oath, that <lb/>
            thou shouldst never be called the wife of an immortal god. <lb/>
            Yet did he lie in wait for thee an unwilling mate, and <lb/>
            would not give thee up, until aged Themis told him all, <lb/>
            how that of a surety it was ordained that thou shouldst <lb/>
            bear a son better than his father; wherefore he gave thee <lb/>
            up, for all his strong desire, in fear that another should be <lb/>
            his rival and rule the deathless gods, yea, and for ever <lb/>
            wrest away his power. But I gave thee the best1 of mortal <lb/>
            men to be thy husband, that thou mightest find the joys of <lb/>
            wedlock and bear children ; and to thy marriage-feast I <lb/>
            bade the gods, one and all, and with mine own hand raised <lb/>
            the wedding torch,2 to repay that thy generous respect. <lb/>
            But come now, I will tell thee a tale that lieth not; when so <lb/>
            thy son cometh to the Elysian plain, he, I mean, whom <lb/>
            water-nymphs now do tend in the home of the Centaur <lb/>
            Chiron, though he longeth for thy milk; needs must3 he be <lb/>
            the husband of Medea, daughter of Æetes ; do thou, then, <lb/>
            as a mother, help thy future daughter, and Peleus as well. <lb/>
            Why is thy wrath so firmly rooted ? 'Tis blindness ; for <lb/>
            even to gods will blindness come. Verily I do think that <note type="footnote"> 1 i.e. Peleus, the father of Achilles. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 I performed for you the most sacred rite of bearing the nuptial <lb/>

            at my bidding Hephæstus will cease to make his furious <lb/>
            fire burn, and Æolus, son of Hippotas, will check the winds' <lb/>
            swift flight, all save the steady west, until they come to <lb/>
            the havens of the Phaeacians; so do thou devise for them <lb/>
            a painless return. My only fear is for thy rocks and <lb/>
            mountainous billows, which, with the aid of thy other <lb/>
            sisters, thou canst turn aside. Oh! leave them not to <lb/>
            drift helplessly into Charybdis, lest with one gulp she take <lb/>
            them all down, nor let them come to Scylla's foul lair, <lb/>
            murderous Scylla of Ausonia, whom Hecate that roameth <lb/>

            and slay the chosen heroes. But keep thou the ship just <lb/>
            in the course where there shall be a hair-breadth escape <lb/>
            from destruction."</p>
          <p>So spake she ; and Thetis answered her thus ; " If, of a. <lb/>
            truth, the furious raging fire and the stormy winds shall <lb/>
            cease, verily I too will with confidence promise to save the <lb/>
            ship from the wave's attack too, while the west wind is <lb/>
            piping. But'tis time to set out upon my long weary way,. <lb/>
            till I shall come unto my sisters, who shall help me, and <lb/>
            to the place where the ship's cables are fastened, that at <lb/>
            dawn they may bethink them of winning their return."</p>
          <p>Therewith she shot down from the sky and plunged <lb/>
            amid the eddies of the deep blue sea, and she called other <lb/>
            Nereids, her own sisters, to her aid, and they heard her <lb/>
            voice and came together. Then Thetis rehearsed the bid­ <lb/>
            ding of Hera, and sent them all at once to the Ausonian <lb/>
            sea. But herself, swifter than the twinkling of an eye, or <lb/>
            the rays of the sun, when he riseth high above the horizon, <lb/>
            sped quickly on her way through the water, till she reached <lb/>
            the Ææan cliff of the Tyrsenian mainland. There she <lb/>
            found the heroes by the ship, taking their pastime with <lb/>
            quoits and archery, and she drew near and took Peleus, <lb/>
            son of Æacus, by the hand, for he was her husband, but <pb n="177"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="L. 816-887.]"/><lb/>
            no man might see her at all; only to his eye did she appear, <lb/>
            and thus spake she: " Abide no longer now sitting on the <lb/>
            Tyrsenian strand, but at dawn loose the hawsers of the <lb/>
            swift ship, in obedience to Hera, your champion. For at her <lb/>
            command my Nereid maids are met, to send your ship in <lb/>
            safety, and with all speed through the rocks which are <lb/>
            called ‘the Wanderers.' For that is your proper route. <lb/>
            But do thou point me out to no man, what time thou seest <lb/>
            me present with these; lay that to heart, lest thou anger <lb/>
            me in more downright earnest than ever thou hast afore."</p>
          <p>Therewith she plunged unseen into the depths of the <lb/>
            sea, and sore grief smote Peleus, for he had never seen her <lb/>
            come, since first she left her bridal chamber in anger, when <lb/>
            noble Achilles was yet a babe. For the goddess ever used to <lb/>
            wrap about his mortal body fiery flame through the night, <lb/>
            and by day she would anoint his tender skin with am­ <lb/>
            brosia,. that he might become immortal, and that she <lb/>
            might ward off hateful old age from his body. But Peleus <lb/>
            saw his dear son gasping in the flame, and he sprang from <lb/>
            his bed with a cry of horror at the sight, fond fool! but <lb/>
            she, when she heard him, cast the screaming babe head­ <lb/>
            long to the ground, and herself passed forth from the house <lb/>
            in haste, like to a breath of wind or as a dream, and leapt <lb/>
            into the sea in anger; and she never came back again. So <lb/>
            blank dismay tied up his heart; yet, for all that, he told to <lb/>
            his comrades all the bidding of Thetis. And they hurriedly <lb/>
            broke off in the midst and ceased their contests, and <lb/>
            busied themselves about supper and their pallet beds, <lb/>
            whereon, when they had eaten, they slept through the <lb/>
            night, as aforetime.</p>
          <p>But when Dawn, giver of light, was touching the edge of <lb/>
            heaven, in that hour they went from the land to sit upon <lb/>
            the rowing benches, as the swift west-wind came down; <lb/>
            and from the deep they hauled up the anchors, glad at <lb/>
            heart; and made all the rest of the tackling taut as was <note type="footnote"> N </note> <pb n="178"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BOOK IV."/><lb/>
            needful; and they set the sail, stretching it on the sheets <lb/>
            of the yardarm. And a gentle wind carried the ship <lb/>
            along. Anon they beheld an island, fair and full of <lb/>
            flowers, where the Sirens, clear-voiced daughters of Ache­ <lb/>
            lous, used to charm with their sweet singing whoso cast <lb/>
            anchor there, and then destroy him. These are the chil­ <lb/>
            dren that comely Terpsichore, one of the Muses, bare to <lb/>
            Achelous for his love; once they had the charge of <lb/>
            Demeter's noble daughter,' while she was yet unwed, sing­ <lb/>
            ing to her in chorus; at that time were they part bird, <lb/>
            part maiden to behold. Ever they keep watch from their <lb/>
            outlook, with its fair haven; and many a one have they <lb/>
            reft of his joyous return, making him waste away slowly ; <lb/>
            forthwith then to the heroes they wafted their delicate <lb/>
            voice. And these would at once have cast their cables on <lb/>
            the rocks, had not Thracian Orpheus, son of Æager, forth­ <lb/>
            with strung his lyre in his hands, and let a hasty snatch <lb/>
            of quick music ring out loudly, that their ears might be <lb/>
            dinned as he at the same time swept the twanging chords; <lb/>
            and his lyre did drown the voice of the maidens. And the <lb/>
            west-wind and the roaring wave, rushing astern, together <lb/>
            bore on the ship, while the Sirens raised their ceaseless 2 <lb/>
            song. Yet even thus Teleon's goodly son, Butes, did alone <lb/>
            elude his fellows and leapt from the polished bench into <lb/>
            the sea, for his heart was melted by the clear singing of <lb/>
            the Sirens ; and he swum through the darkling swell to <lb/>
            reach that shore, unhappy mortal! Quickly would they <lb/>
            rob him of his return then and there; but the goddess <lb/>
            Cypris, who watcheth o'er Ervx,3 did pity him, and <note type="footnote"> 1 Proserpine, the daughter of Demeter, who was guarded in her <lb/>

            caught him up, while he was yet in the eddying wave, <lb/>
            and with kindly aid brought him to a safe dwelling- <lb/>
            place on the headland of Lilybeum. So they left the <lb/>
            Sirens, holden with grief withal; but other perils of <lb/>
            shipwreck, direr still, did await them in the strait, where <lb/>
            two seas meet. For on one side arose Scylla's sheer wall <lb/>
            of cliff, and on the other Charybdis did spout and roar <lb/>
            unceasingly; while in another place " the Wandering rocks " <lb/>
            thundered at the buffet of mighty waves, there where in <lb/>
            front of them a blazing flame vomited from the top of the <lb/>
            crags, high o'er a red-hot rock. And the air was murky <lb/>
            with smoke; nor couldst thou have seen the rays of the sun. <lb/>
            Moreover, though Hephæstus had ceased from his work, <lb/>
            the sea still sent up warm steam. Here the Nereids flocked <lb/>
            from all sides to meet them ; while the goddess, lady <lb/>
            Thetis, took hold of the rudder-blade behind to drag the <lb/>
            ship inside the Wandering rocks." As when dolphins <lb/>
            come forth from the sea in fair weather, and gambol in <lb/>
            flocks round a speeding ship, now seen in front, and now <lb/>
            behind, and yet again alongside, to the joy of the sailors; <lb/>
            even so the Nereids darted up and circled in their ranks <lb/>
            about the good ship Argo, while Thetis steered her course. <lb/>
            Now when they were just coming nigh unto the Wandering <lb/>
            rocks, in a moment they drew the edge of their robes up <lb/>
            above their white knees, and darting up to the very top of <lb/>
            the cliffs and on to the beach, ranged themselves in rows <lb/>
            on either side. And the stream smote upon the ship's <lb/>
            side, and the wave, rising furiously about them, broke <lb/>
            over the rocks. And these at one moment had their sharp <lb/>
            points covered as it were with mist, and at another their <lb/>
            base was seen far down beneath the nether depth, while <lb/>
            that wild surf poured in floods over them. But they, like <lb/>
            maids, who play at ball hard by a sandy beach, with the <lb/>
            folds of their dress rolled up to their waists out of their <lb/>
            way; and one catcheth the ball from another and sends it <pb n="180"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BOOK IV."/><lb/>
            soaring high into the air, and it never reaches the ground; <lb/>
            even So they sent the ship on her way from hand to hand <lb/>
            o'er the crests of the waves, ever clear of the rocks, while <lb/>
            the water belched and seethed around them. There on the <lb/>
            top of a smooth rock stood king Hephæstus in person, <lb/>
            resting his heavy shoulder on the handle of his hammer, <lb/>
            and watching them; and above the dazzling firmament <lb/>
            stood the wife of Zeus, with her arm about Athene's waist, <lb/>
            so mightily was she frightened at the sight. Long as is <lb/>
            a day's allotted space in spring-time, so long they toiled, <lb/>
            heaving the ship through the echoing rocks ; and the <lb/>
            heroes, catching the wind once more, sped onward, and <lb/>
            quickly they passed the meadow of Trinacria, where graze <lb/>
            the kine of Helios. Then did the Nereids .plunge beneath <lb/>
            the depths like water-fowl, for they had performed the <lb/>
            commands of the wife of Zeus. Now did the bleating of <lb/>
            sheep come to them confusedly through the air, and a <lb/>
            lowing of kine smote upon their ears nigh at hand. The <lb/>
            sheep was Phaethusa, youngest of the daughters of Helios, <lb/>
            shepherding adown the dewy thickets, with a crook of <lb/>
            silver in her hand; but Lampetie herded the kine, bran­ <lb/>
            dishing a herdsman’s staff of gleaming orichalcum. These <lb/>
            kine the heroes .saw grazing by the waters of the river <lb/>
            along the plain and the water meadow ; there was not one <lb/>
            among them of dark colour, but all, white as milk, with <lb/>
            horns of gold, moved proudly on their way. By these they <lb/>
            passed in the day-time ; and in the coming night they cleft <lb/>
            their path o'er a wide gulf of sea, rejoicing; till once again <lb/>
            Dawn, child of morning, shed his light upon their path.</p>
          <p>Now there is in front1 of the Ionian gulf a rich island, <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">παροιτέρη</foreign> = <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἔμπροσθεν. ἀμφιλαφής</foreign> either = thickly covered with <lb/>

            thickly overgrown, in the Ceraunian sea, beneath which, <lb/>
            legend saith, there lies a sickle-be gracious, ye Muses, for I <lb/>
            tell not willingly this tale of olden times-wherewith Cronos <lb/>
            reft his sire of his manhood ruthlessly ; but others say it is <lb/>
            the reaping-hook of Demeter, goddess of the nether world. <lb/>
            For Demeter, they say, once dwelt in that land, and taught <lb/>
            the Titans to reap the corn-crop for her love of Maoris ; <lb/>
            whence it was called " the Hook " 1 by name, and became <lb/>
            the sacred nursing-mother of the Phæacians, and so it is <lb/>
            that the Phæacians really are by lineage of the blood of <lb/>
            Uranus. To them came Argo, after stress of many toils, <lb/>
            driven by the wind from the Trinacrian sea ;and these, <lb/>
            Alcinous and his people, received them gladly at their <lb/>
            coming with gracious sacrifice ; and the whole city made <lb/>
            merry in their honour; thou wouldst have said, 'twas their <lb/>
            own sons they were rejoicing over. And the heroes like­ <lb/>
            wise rejoiced among the folk, even as if they had set foot <lb/>
            in the heart of Hæmonia. But soon were they to arm and <lb/>
            raise the battle-cry, so close behind them hove in sight a <note type="footnote">sense it is used elsewhere, e.g. in Herodotus, of elephants. From <lb/>
            Homer's account we learn that this island, Corcyra, had a harbour on <lb/>
            both sides, so that it is not unlikely that Alexandrine grammarians <lb/>
            made use of this fact to account for the meaning of a difficult and un­ <lb/>
            explained Homeric word. </note><note type="footnote"> 1 Drepane, i.e. Corcyra, had had a variety of names, viz., Maoris, <lb/>

            each man of the chieftains in turn: " For you, ye peerless <lb/>

            toil, and shed calm o'er all the earth together; but to the <lb/>
            maiden's couch came no sleep, no, never so little; but her <lb/>
            heart within her breast was wrung with anguish. As when <lb/>
            a toiling woman winds her thread the livelong night, and <lb/>
            about her moan her orphan babes, now she is widowed; <lb/>
            and the tear-drop courses down her cheek, as she weepeth <lb/>
            for the piteous lot that hath fallen to her; even so Medea's <lb/>
            cheeks were wet, and her heart within her was throbbing, <lb/>
            pierced with sharp agony.</p>
          <p>Now those twain, the lord Alcinous.and Arete, his wife <lb/>
            revered, were in their house within the city, as aforetime, <lb/>
            pondering the maiden's case, upon their bed by night; and <lb/>
            thus the wife addressed her lord and husband with per­ <lb/>
            suasive' words: "Dear husband, come, rescue this poor <lb/>
            maiden, I pray thee, from the Colchians, doing a favour to <lb/>
            the Minyæ. For Argos and the men of Hæmonia are very <lb/>
            nigh unto our island, but Æetes neither dwelleth near us, <lb/>
            nor know we aught of him save by hearsay; and this poor <lb/>
            suffering maid hath broken my heart by her entreaties. <lb/>
            Give her not over to the Colchians to take to her father's <lb/>
            home, 0 king. 'Twas blindly done, when she did give him <lb/>
            at the first her drugs to charm the oxen; and now, to cure <lb/>
            one evil by another close upon it, as oft we do through our <lb/>
            mistakes, she hath fled from the awful fury of her proud <lb/>
            father. Moreover Jason, as I hear, is bound by a mighty <lb/>
            oath of his own taking to make her his wedded wife within <lb/>
            his halls. Wherefore, dear husband, make not the son of <lb/>
            Æson to perjure himself, at least if thou canst help it; <lb/>
            nor let the father in his fury do his child some terrible in­ <lb/>
            jury, when thou canst stay it. For parents are exceeding <lb/>
            jealous of their children; such punishment did Nycteus <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">θαλεροι̃σι</foreign>, etym. <foreign xml:lang="grc">θαλει̃ν</foreign>, so = (1) blooming, fresh; vigorous, active; <lb/>

            again, that Danae2 endured upon the deep, all through her <lb/>
            father's infatuate folly ; yea, and but lately, and not so far <lb/>
            away, did Echetus' in wanton cruelty thrust bronze spikes <lb/>
            into his daughter's eyeballs; and now she wastes away by <lb/>
            a piteous fate, grinding bronze 4 for corn within a gloomy <lb/>
            hut."</p>
          <p>Thus spake she in entreaty; and his heart melted at the <lb/>
            words of his wife, and thus he answered, " Arete, I would <lb/>
            even drive out the Colchians with their harness for the <lb/>
            maiden's sake, doing a favour to the heroes. But I do fear <lb/>
            to slight the just ordinance of Zeus. Nor is it well to treat <lb/>
            Æetes lightly, as thou sayest; for there is no mightier <lb/>
            prince than he. And if he will, he will carry his quarrel <lb/>
            against Hellas, though he come from far. Wherefore it <lb/>
            behoveth me to give the judgment that shall seem best <lb/>
            amongst all men, and I will not hide it from thee. If she <note type="footnote"> 1 Antiope, the daughter of Nycteus, was ravished by Zens, who had <lb/>
            changed himself into a satyr for the purpose. Her father was so <lb/>
            enraged that she had to fly for her life, and came to Sicyon, where she <lb/>
            bore Zethus and Amphion, and suffered many hardships for her secret <lb/>
            love. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Danaë was the daughter of Acrisius. Her father had been told by <lb/>
            an oracle of Apollo that, if his daughter bore a son, this son would <lb/>
            cause his death. So Acrisius went to Argos, and there shut his daughter <lb/>
            up straitly in a tower of brass, but Zeus was enamoured of her beauty, <lb/>
            and introduced himself to her in a shower of gold, despite her keepers. <lb/>
            Perseus was the issue of their love. Acrisius, in his anger, set mother <lb/>
            and child adrift on the sea, but fishermen saved them. In after years, <lb/>
            when Perseus grew up, he engaged in some games at Larissa; and <lb/>
            there, by accident, threw a quoit upon the foot of Acrisius and slew <lb/>
            him, and so the oracle was fulfilled. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 Echetus is also mentioned by Homer as the most savage of men, as <lb/>

            be yet a maid, my decision is, that they carry her back to <lb/>
            her father; but, if she share a husband's bed, I will not <lb/>
            separate her from her lord; nor, if she carry a child within <lb/>
            her womb, do I give her up unto her enemies."</p>
          <p>So spake he; and forthwith fell asleep. But she laid <lb/>
            up in her heart his wise words, and at once arose from her <lb/>
            bed, and went about the house ; and the women, her hand­ <lb/>
            maids, hastened together, bustling about their mistress. <lb/>
            Quietly she had her herald called, and told him her com­ <lb/>
            mands, in her shrewdness eager that the son of Æson <lb/>
            should at once wed the maiden, and so avoid entreating <lb/>
            king Alcinous; for this was the decision he would carry <lb/>
            with his own lips to the Colchians, that, if she were yet a <lb/>
            maid, he would deliver her to her father's house; but, if <lb/>
            she were already some man's wife, he would sever her no <lb/>
            more from honourable love.</p>
          <p>So spake Arete, and quickly his feet bare him from the <lb/>
            hall, that he might announce to Jason the fair speech of <lb/>
            Arete, and the plan of godlike Alcinous. And he found <lb/>
            them keeping watch by the ship in harness in the Hyllic <lb/>
            harbour, near to the town; so he told them all his message, <lb/>
            and the heart of each hero was glad, for he spake a word <lb/>
            that pleased them right well.</p>
          <p>At once they mixed a bowl for the blessed gods, as was <lb/>
            right, and dragged sheep to the altar with pious hands, <lb/>
            and made ready that very night for the maiden her bridal <lb/>
            bed in the holy cave, where Macris once did dwell, the <lb/>
            daughter of Aristæus, the bee-keeper, who discovered the <lb/>
            use of honey and the fatness of the olive, prize of toil. <lb/>
            She it was, that at the first took to her breast the Nysean <lb/>
            son of Zeus in Eubcea, home of the Abantes,1 and with honey <lb/>
            she moistened his parched lips, when Hermes brought him <note type="footnote"> 1 ’<foreign xml:lang="grc">Εύβοἰης</foreign> ’<foreign xml:lang="grc">Αβαντίδος</foreign>. Eubcea was anciently called Abantis, from <lb/>

             <note type="correspondsTo" n="L. 1104-1162.]"/><lb/>
            from out the fire; 1 but Hera saw her, and in her rage drove <lb/>
            her right away from the island. So then she came to <lb/>
            dwell far away in the holy cavern of the Phæacians, <lb/>
            and she granted to the folk around wondrous pros­ <lb/>
            perity. There then they strewed a great couch, and <lb/>
            upon it did throw the glistering fleece of gold, that the <lb/>
            marriage might have honour and renown. And the <lb/>
            nymphs plucked every kind of blossom and brought them <lb/>
            in their white bosoms, and a blaze as of fire played round <lb/>
            them all; so bright was the radiance gleaming from the <lb/>
            golden tufts. And it kindled in their eyes a sweet desire, <lb/>
            yet reverence prevented each one from laying hands <lb/>
            thereon, for all her longing. Of these some were called <lb/>
            the daughters of the river Ægæus; others dwelt about the <lb/>
            peaks of the hill of Melite, and some came from the plains, <lb/>
            woodland nymphs. For Hera herself, the wife of Zeus, <lb/>
            had sent them, in honour of Jason. And that cave, to this <lb/>
            day, is called Medea's sacred grotto, where they spread fine <lb/>
            linen, very fragrant, and wedded those twain together. <lb/>
            Meantime the heroes brandished in their hands their war­ <lb/>
            like spears, that no unseen host of foes might fall upon <lb/>
            them to fight withal, ere the deed was done; and wreath­ <lb/>
            ing their heads with leafy boughs, they sung in tune to the <lb/>
            clear music of Orpheus a marriage hymn at the entrance <lb/>
            to the bridal bower. Now the hero, the son of Æson, was <lb/>
            not minded to complete his marriage now, but in the halls <lb/>
            of his father, on his return to Iolchos; and Medea, too, <lb/>
            was of like mind with him. But needs must they wed <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐκ πυρός</foreign>. Dionysus, the son of Zeus and Semele, was saved when <lb/>
            his mother perished through her own folly in desiring to see Zeus <lb/>
            appear in all his majesty. The mother was killed by the blaze of the <lb/>
            lightning (cf. the opening of Euripides' “Baccbæ”),but Hermes snatched <lb/>
            the untimely babe from her womb and carried it to Zeus, in whose side <lb/>
            it was sewn up until the proper time for its birth arrived. Zeus then <lb/>
            handed it over to the nymph Maoris to rear, but Hera's jealousy perse­ <lb/>
            cuted Maoris relentlessly in consequence. </note> <pb n="188"/>

            then and there. Yea, for never do we tribes of suffering <lb/>
            mortals embark on happiness without alloy; but ever <lb/>
            there cometh with our gladness some bitter grief. Where­ <lb/>
            fore they too, for all their joy of sweet love, were holden <lb/>
            with fear, whether the decision of Alcinous would be <lb/>
            fulfilled.</p>
          <p>Then came Dawn again with his light divine, and broke <lb/>
            up the gloom of night throughout the sky; and the island <lb/>
            beach and the dewy paths across the plains laughed out <lb/>
            afar; and in the streets was the noise of men; for through <lb/>
            the city the inhabitants were astir, and the Colchians far <lb/>
            away at the end of the Macridian peninsula. Anon went <lb/>
            Alcinous to them, as he had agreed, to declare his purpose <lb/>
            concerning the maiden, and in his hand he held his golden <lb/>
            wand of judgment; whereby the folk had righteous judg­ <lb/>
            ment dealt them throughout the city. And with him came <lb/>
            the chiefs of the Phæacians in their warlike gear, drawn <lb/>
            up in ranks. And forth from the towers came the women <lb/>
            in crowds to see the heroes, and with them came the <lb/>
            country folk when they heard thereof, for Hera had sent <lb/>
            forth a sure report. One brought the chosen ram of his <lb/>
            flock, and another a heifer that never yet had worked, and <lb/>
            others set jars of wine nigh at hand for mixing; and the <lb/>
            smoke and flame of sacrifice leapt up in the distance. But <lb/>
            the women brought fine linen, fruit of honest toil, as <lb/>
            women will, and toys of gold, and divers ornaments beside, <lb/>
            such as couples newly-wed are furnished with; and they <lb/>
            were astonied to see the form and beauty of the noble <lb/>
            heroes, and the son of Æager in their midst oft beating the <lb/>
            ground with his rich sandal in time to his ringing lyre and <lb/>
            song. And all the nymphs in chorus, whenever he made <lb/>
            mention of marriage, raised a joyous wedding hymn; and <lb/>
            yet again would others sing alone, as they circled round in <lb/>
            the dance in thy honour, 0 Hera; for 'twas thou, who <lb/>
            didst put it in the heart of Arete to speak her word of <pb n="189"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="L. 1168-1224.]"/><lb/>
            wisdom to Alcinous. But he, so soon as he had declared <lb/>
            the issue of his judgment, and when already the marriage <lb/>
            was declared complete, took good care that so it should <lb/>
            abide for ever; for no deadly fear, nor the grievous threats <lb/>
            of Æetes touched him, but he held fast bound by the oath <lb/>
            he would not break.</p>
          <p>So when the Colchians learnt that they were come to him <lb/>
            in vain, and he bade them either hold his ordinances <lb/>
            in honour or withdraw their ships far from the harbours of <lb/>
            his land; then but not before were they afraid of the <lb/>
            threats of their own king, and besought Alcinous to receive <lb/>
            them among his people; so for a very long time afterward <lb/>
            they dwelt among the Phæacians, until the Bacchiadæ,1 a. <lb/>
            race of men that came from Corinth, settled among them <lb/>
            after a while; then they crossed to the island over against <lb/>
            them, and from thence they were soon to go to the Cerau­ <lb/>
            nian hills of the Abantes and the Nestæans 2 and to Oricum; <lb/>
            but these things happened after a long lapse of years. Yet <lb/>
            still do the altars, which Medea builded there to the Fates <lb/>
            and the Nymphs in the holy place of Apollo, god of shep­ <lb/>
            herds, receive their yearly sacrifice. Now when the Minyæ <lb/>
            went away, Alcinous gave them many a stranger's gift, and <lb/>
            Arete did the like; moreover she gave to Medea twelve <lb/>
            Phæacian slave-girls from her house, to bear her company. <lb/>
            'Twas on the seventh day they left Drepane ; and a fresh <lb/>
            breeze came forth from Zeus at dawn, and they went hast­ <lb/>
            ing onward before the breath of the wind. Still it was not <lb/>

            had toiled somewhat further, even in Libya's utmost <lb/>

          <p>Lo! they had even now left the bay behind, that is <lb/>
            named after the Ambracians; even now had they left, with <lb/>
            all sail set, the land of AEtolia 1 and next thereto the isles of <lb/>
            the Echinades with their narrow passage, and the land of <lb/>
            Pelops just hove in sight, when the baleful blast of the <lb/>
            north-wind caught them in mid course and swept them <lb/>
            nine whole nights and as many days towards the Libyan <lb/>
            sea, till they came right within the Syrtis,2 whence cometh <lb/>
            no ship forth again, when once 'tis forced inside that gulf. <lb/>
            For all around are shoals, and masses of sea-weed on every <lb/>
            side, and thereon are bubbles of noiseless foam, while on <lb/>
            the dim horizon stretches a plain of sand. No creeping <lb/>
            thing nor winged creature moveth thereupon. 'Twas here <lb/>
            that the flood-tide thrust them far up the beach on a sud­ <lb/>
            'den, and only a little of the keel was left in the water, for <lb/>
            yon tide full oft recoils from the land, and then again with <lb/>
            furious onset discharges itself over the beach.</p>
          <p>But they leapt forth from the ship, and sorrow seized <lb/>
            them, when they beheld the great wide stretch of misty <lb/>
            land, reaching on and on into the distance like a haze; nor <lb/>
            could they see any place to water in, nor path, nor herds­ <lb/>
            men's steading far away; but all was wrapt in deathless <lb/>
            calm. And one would ask his neighbour sorrowfully, <lb/>

            be it never so short a while ? so desolate is the strand of <lb/>

          <p>Thus would he say; and amongst them Ancæus, the <lb/>
            helmsman, made harangue, sore grieved himself at the <lb/>
            hopelessness of their evil case : " We are undone, it seems, <lb/>
            by a most grievous fate, and there is no escaping from our <lb/>
            trouble, but now must we suffer ghastly woes where we <lb/>
            have fallen on this wilderness, if haply the winds blow <lb/>
            steadily from the land, for I see on all sides a sea of shoals <lb/>
            after a wide look-out, and the water is fretted into long <lb/>
            lines of foam as it washes just the surface of the gray sand. <lb/>
            Yea, and long, long ago would yon sacred ship have been <lb/>
            miserably shattered far from the shore, unless the tide <lb/>

            and spray alone, that covereth but the top of the ground, <lb/>
            breaks about us. Wherefore I deem that all hope of our <lb/>
            voyage and our return is utterly cut off. So let some other <lb/>
            shew his skill, for he may sit at the helm striving to win <lb/>
            our escape. But Zeus hath no great wish to bring about <lb/>
            the day of return, after all our toil."</p>
          <p>So spake he through his tears ; and all they that knew <lb/>
            aught of ships spake with him in his distress; but the <lb/>
            heart of all, I trow, was cold and stiff, and paleness spread <lb/>
            o’er their cheeks. As when men move like lifeless spectres, <lb/>
            about a town, awaiting the end that war or famine bring, <lb/>
            or the issue of some fearful storm, which hath washed away <lb/>

            night from the sky, while through the gloom the stars <lb/>
            shine bright; even so the chieftains wandered now, <lb/>
            groping their way along the weary strand. Anon dark eve <note type="footnote"> 1 i.e. the tilled lands. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="192"/>
            came down upon them; and they, piteously embracing <lb/>
            each other, were fain to weep, that thereafter they might <lb/>
            lie down, each man apart, to die upon the sand. Hither <lb/>
            and thither they went their way to find a resting-place <lb/>
            further off; and then they wrapped their heads in their <lb/>
            cloaks and laid them down without meat1 or drink the whole <lb/>
            night and the dawn, waiting a death most miserable. <lb/>
            Apart from them beside the daughter of Æetes her <lb/>
            maidens moaned, huddled all together. As when in the <lb/>
            wilderness young birds unfledged fall from a hole in the <lb/>
            rock and loudly do they twitter; or as when on the banks <lb/>
            of fair-flowing Pactolus2 swans lift up their melody, and the <lb/>
            dewy meadow echoes around, and the river's fair streams; <lb/>
            even so those maidens, casting their golden tresses in the <lb/>
            dust, wailed the livelong night a piteous lament. And all, <lb/>
            then and there, would have vanished from among the <lb/>
            living, out of the ken of mortal men, yea, those chosen <lb/>
            heroes on their aimless quest, had not the heroines,3 who <lb/>
            watch o'er Libya, pitied them hopelessly wasting away; <lb/>

            looked aside, in reverence for the goddesses. And they <lb/>
            with gentle words spake unto him alone openly in his <lb/>
            affliction, " Poor wretch! why art thou so cast down ? We <lb/>

            travail in bearing you so long time in her womb; and so <lb/>
            shall ye yet return to holy Achæa.”</p>
          <p>So spake they, and forthwith vanished from their place, <lb/>
            as their words died away. But Jason sat up on the <lb/>
            ground and looked about him, and thus spake he: "Be <lb/>
            gracious, noble goddesses, who dwell in this wilderness, <lb/>

            him with downcast looks, and he made them sit down in <lb/>
            their sorrow nigh to where the ship lay, together with <lb/>
            the women,1 and made harangue, declaring each thing: <lb/>
            " Friends, hearken; there stood above my head, very nigh <lb/>
            to me, as I lay grieving, three goddesses, girt in goat­ <lb/>
            skins from the neck above about the back and waist, like <lb/>
            maidens; and with light hand they drew aside my robe <lb/>
            and uncovered my head, bidding me rise up myself, and <lb/>
            go rouse you; and they bid us pay bounteous recom­ <lb/>

            this long time in her womb, whenso Amphitrite shall <lb/>
            loose the smooth-running car of Poseidon. Now I cannot <lb/>
            wholly understand this message divine. They said, in­ <lb/>
            deed, that they were heroines, daughters of Libya and <lb/>
            warders of her land. Yea, and they declared that full well <lb/>
            they knew everything that we ourselves had endured ere <lb/>
            this on land and sea. Then I saw them no more in their <lb/>
            place, but some mist or cloud came betwixt us and veiled <lb/>
            their brightness.”</p>
          <p>So spake he, and they were all astonied as they lis­ <lb/>
            tened. Then came unto the Minyæ this wonder passing <lb/>
            strange: From out the sea toward the land leapt forth a <lb/>
            monster horse ; a mighty2 steed was he, with mane of gold <lb/>
            floating in the wind; lightly he spurned the salt foam <lb/>
            from his legs and. started on his course with legs that <lb/>
            matched the wind. Then up spake Peleus with a cry of <lb/>
            joy among his comrades gathered there: " Verily I do <note type="footnote"> 1 i.e. Medea and her twelve Phaeacian handmaids, given her by <lb/>

            think that Poseidon's chariot hath already been loosed by <lb/>
            the hands of his dear wife, and I deem that our mother is <lb/>
            no other than the ship herself; for surely she doth bear <lb/>
            us in her womb and groaneth unceasingly in hard travail. <lb/>
            Come, we will lift her up with unshaken might and tireless <lb/>
            shoulders and carry her within this sandy country, whither <lb/>
            yon swift steed is gone before us. For he, brave beast, <lb/>
            will not plunge beneath the dry ground, and I trow his <lb/>
            tracks will show us some bay of the sea far inland."</p>
          <p>So spake he; and his ready counsel pleased them all. <lb/>
            This is the tale the Muses told; and I, the servant of the <lb/>
            Pierian maidens, do sing it; and this is what I heard <lb/>
            in all honesty, that ye, brave sons of kings, exceeding <lb/>
            bold, did lift your ship and all ye took therein high <lb/>
            upon your shoulders and carried her in your might and <lb/>
            manhood o'er the desert sandhills of Libya twelve whole <lb/>
            days and as many nights. Yet who can tell the pain and <lb/>
            anguish these men endured in that toil ? Surely they were <lb/>
            of the blood of the immortals, so great was the work they <lb/>
            took upon them under the stress of need. Now when they <lb/>
            had carried her right gladly far to the waters of the lake <lb/>
            Tritonis,' straightway they waded in and set her down from <lb/>
            their stalwart shoulders.</p>
          <p>Then like hounds, mad with thirst, they darted forth to <lb/>
            find a spring; for to their misery and suffering was added <lb/>
            parching drought. But not in vain did they wander ; and <lb/>
            they came to the sacred plain,where but yesterday Ladon,2 <note type="footnote"> 1 A lake in Libya. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Ladon was the huge serpent which guarded the apples of the Hes­ <lb/>
            perides, and was slain by Heracles a few days before the arrival of the <lb/>
            Argonauts in Libya. The Hesperides were nymphs, daughters of <lb/>
            Phorcus and Ceto, who ministered to the wants of the guardian snake. <lb/>
            On the appearance of the Argonauts they changed into dust and ashes, <lb/>
            until Orpheus besought their aid, when they resumed their original <lb/>
            forms under the names Hespere, Erytheis, and Ægle, and showed the <lb/>
            Argonauts where to find water. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="196"/>
            a serpent of that land, did guard the golden apples in the <lb/>
            place of Atlas, while about him the Hesperides used to <lb/>
            busy themselves, singing their lovely song. But now, lo! <lb/>
            he was fallen against the trunk of the apple-tree from the <lb/>
            wound that Heracles had given him; only with the tip of <lb/>
            his tail was he still writhing, but from his head unto the <lb/>
            end of his dark spine lifeless he lay; and where the arrows <lb/>
            had left their bitter gall in the blood of the Lernæan snake <lb/>
            flies were busy at his festering wounds. And near him <lb/>
            the Hesperides raised their loud lament, their fair white <lb/>
            arms clasped about their golden hair; when on a sudden <lb/>
            came the heroes nigh to them, and lo ! at once those maidens <lb/>
            turned, as they stood, to dust and ashes, even while the <lb/>
            men came hasting on. But Orpheus was ware of the <lb/>
            divine marvel, and for his comrades' sake he lifted up a <lb/>
            prayer to the maidens: "Ye queens divine, so fair and <lb/>
            kind, be gracious, whether ye are counted amongst the <lb/>
            goddesses of heaven, or those of earth, or are called the <lb/>
            nymphs that tend the sheep-fold; come, maidens, holy <lb/>
            race of Oceanus, appear to us face to face, and show us at <lb/>
            our desire some fount of water gushing from the rock, or <lb/>
            some holy stream bubbling up from the earth, whereat, <lb/>
            0 goddesses, to quench the thirst, that parches us un­ <lb/>
            ceasingly. And if we come again some day o'er the sea to <lb/>
            the land of Achæa, then will we offer you gladly countless <lb/>
            gifts amongst the first of goddesses, with drink-offerings <lb/>
            and rich feasts."</p>
          <p>So prayed he aloud; and the goddesses from their sta­ <lb/>
            tion nigh had pity on their suffering, and first of all they <lb/>
            made grass spring up from the earth, and above the grass <lb/>
            tall shoots sprang up; and next young trees in bloom shot <lb/>
            high o'er the ground and stood upright. Hespere became <lb/>
            a poplar, Erytheis an elm, and Ægle a willow with sacred <lb/>
            trunk. And from these trees their forms looked out, even <lb/>
            as they were before, a wonder passing strange; then spake <lb/>
             <pb n="197"/>
            Ægle to their longing ears a gentle answer, " Yea, verily <lb/>
            there hath come hither one that can succour your troubles <lb/>
            full well, that man accursed,1 who robbed our guardian <lb/>
            snake of life, and is gone taking with him the golden <lb/>
            apples of the goddesses; and grievous woe is left to us. <lb/>
            Yestreen there came a man, a very fiend in form and <lb/>
            wanton violence ; his eyes gleamed from under his grim2 <lb/>
            forehead ; a ruthless wretch ; and he was girt about with <lb/>
            the skin of a huge lion, rough and untanned, and he bare <lb/>
            a heavy bough of olive, and a bow, wherewith he shot to <lb/>
            death yon monster-snake. And he too came all parched with <lb/>
            thirst, as a wayfarer might; and wildly he rushed about <lb/>
            this place in quest of water, but none was he likely to see, <lb/>
            I trow. Now here stood a rock nigh to the lake Tritonis, <lb/>
            which he, strong giant, smote with his foot below, on pur­ <lb/>
            pose or mayhap by some god's prompting; and yonder <lb/>
            spring gushed out at once. Then did he, sprawling with <lb/>
            hands and chest upon the ground, drink a mighty draught <lb/>
            from the cleft in the rock, till, like a beast with head <lb/>
            thrown forward, he had filled his deep belly."</p>
          <p>So spake she; and gladly they hasted with joyful steps, <lb/>
            until they found the spot where Ægle had told them of <lb/>
            the spring. As when burrowing ants crawl in swarms <lb/>
            about a narrow hole, or as when flies, lighting about a <lb/>
            tiny drop of sweet honey, do throng there in terrible <lb/>
            eagerness ; even so the Minyæ then were thronging around <lb/>
            the spring in the rock; and thus would one say in his <lb/>
            gladness as he moistened his lips, " Lo! you now; in very <lb/>
            sooth, Heracles, though far away, hath saved his comrades <lb/>
            dying of thirst. Aye, would that we might find him on <lb/>
            his way, as we pass through the mainland ! "</p>

            had answered; they started up and parted, hither and <lb/>
            thither, to search ; for on the night-wind a sound of steps <lb/>
            had come rolling to their ears, as the sand was stirred. <lb/>
            Forth sped the two sons of Boreas, trusting to their wings; <lb/>
            and Euphemus, relying on his fleetness of foot; and <lb/>
            Lynceus too, to cast his keen glance far and wide; and <lb/>
            yet a fifth hurried to their side, even Canthus. Him, I <lb/>
            trow, did heaven's high will and his brave soul send forth <lb/>
            upon that journey, that he might learn for certain from <lb/>
            Heracles, where he had left Polyphemus, son of Elatus; <lb/>
            for he was minded to question him on every point about <lb/>
            his comrade. But Polyphemus had founded a famous <lb/>
            town among the Mysians, and then, anxious to return, had <lb/>
            gone in quest of Argo afar across the mainland; and he <lb/>
            came meantime to the land of the Chalybes, that live <lb/>
            beside the sea; there did his fate o'ertake him. And his <lb/>
            tomb lieth beneath a tall poplar, facing the sea, a little <lb/>
            space therefrom. But now Lynceus thought he saw <lb/>
            Heracles alone, far away over the boundless shore, just as <lb/>
            a man seeth, or thinks he seeth, the new moon through a <lb/>
            mist. So he came, and told his companions, that no one <lb/>
            could ever track him further and o'ertake 1 him on his way; <lb/>
            and back those others also came, Euphemus, fleet of foot, <lb/>
            and the two sons of Thracian Boreas, after fruitless toil.</p>
          <p>But on thee, Canthus, fate laid her deadly hold. Thou <lb/>

            knew it, took up his corpse and brought it back and buried <lb/>
            him ; but those sheep the heroes took unto themselves, <lb/>

            to hinder death. Now there was lying on the sand a fear­ <lb/>
            some snake, seeking to avoid the noontide heat, too sluggish <lb/>
            indeed purposely to wound an unwitting foe, nor yet would <lb/>
            it have darted at one who shrunk from meeting it. But <lb/>
            on whomsoever it once should dart its black venom of all <lb/>

            trod upon the reptile's back with the sole of his left foot; <lb/>

            lethargy, that looseth the limbs, was spreading, and o'er <lb/>
            his eyes fell a thick mist. Anon his heavy limbs sank <lb/>
            upon the ground, and he grew cold and helpless ; and his <lb/>
            comrades gathered round him, and the hero son of Æson, <lb/>
            sore dismayed at this chain of disasters. Not even, when <lb/>
            dead, might he lie ever so short a time in the sun; for the <lb/>
            venom at once began to rot the flesh within, and the hair <lb/>
            decayed and fell from the skin. So, quickly and in haste, <lb/>
            they dug a deep grave with brazen picks ; and themselves <lb/>
            and the maidens likewise tore their hair, bewailing the <lb/>
            dead man's piteous fate ; and thrice, in harness clad, they <lb/>
            marched round him, when he had gotten his fair meed of <lb/>
            burial; and then heaped up the earth above him.</p>
          <p>But when they were gone aboard,-for the south wind <lb/>
            blew across the sea,—and were determined to go on their <lb/>
            way across the lake Tritonis, no longer had they any plan, <lb/>
            and so were driven at random the livelong day. As a <lb/>
            serpent creeps along his crooked path, when the sun's <lb/>
            piercing heat doth scorch him, and twists his head from <lb/>
            side to side, hissing the while, and his eyes withal flash <lb/>

            brought the head to Polydectes, and turned him and his people into <lb/>
            stone, because they had formerly refused him hospitality. After this, <lb/>
            Athene took the head, and placed it as a blazon on her shield. Legend <lb/>
            said that as Perseus flew over Libya with his spoil, the blood which <lb/>
            fell from the freshly-severed head turned into the most venomous <lb/>

            hole through a cleft; even so Argo long time was busy <lb/>
            seeking an outlet for ships from the lake. Anon Orpheus <lb/>
            bade bring out from the hold Apollo's mighty tripod, and <lb/>
            set it up before the gods of that land to be a propitiation <lb/>
            for their return. So they went and set up on the shore <lb/>

            semblance of a young man, and taking up a clod of earth <lb/>
            he offered it unto the chieftains as a stranger's gift with <lb/>
            these words, Take this, good friends; for no great gift have <lb/>

            For lo ! my father Poseidon made me very knowing in this <lb/>

          <p>So spake he ; and gladly Euphemus held out his hands <lb/>
            for the clod, and thus addressed him in reply, " Hero, if <lb/>
            haply thou knowest aught of Apis2 and the sea of Minos, <lb/>
            tell us truly at our asking. For hither we are come, not of <lb/>

            showed them far away the sea and the lake's deep mouth, <lb/>
            and thus he said, " Lo! yonder is the outlet to the sea, just <lb/>

          <p>So spake he with good will; and they went aboard'quickly, <lb/>
            eager to row out from the lake. And on they sped in <lb/>
            their haste; but he meantime, even Triton, took up the <lb/>
            mighty tripod and was seen to enter the lake, but after <lb/>
            that no man saw him, how he vanished so near them, <lb/>
            tripod and all. And their heart was cheered, for that one <lb/>

            they bade the son of Æson offer in his honour the choicest <lb/>
            of their remaining sheep, and raise the song of praise, <lb/>
            when he had taken him. Quickly that hero chose him <lb/>
            out with haste, and, having taken him up to the stern, <lb/>
            there sacrificed him, and prayed, " God, who didst appear <lb/>

          <p>Therewith and as he prayed, he cut the throat of the <lb/>
            sheep and cast him from the stern into the water. And <lb/>
            lo ! the god appeared from out the deep in his own true <lb/>

            from the top of his head and about his back and waist as <lb/>

            On he led the ship, till he brought her on her way into the <lb/>
            sea, and then suddenly he plunged beneath the mighty <lb/>
            depths; and those heroes cried out, when they saw the <lb/>

            on they sped before the breath of the west wind. And on <lb/>
            the next morning they saw a projecting tongue of land <lb/>
            and an inland sea lying beyond it. Anon the west wind <lb/>
            ceased, and the breath of the clear south came on, and <lb/>
            they were glad at heart for the wind. But when the sun <lb/>
            sank, and rose the star, that bids the shepherd fold1 and <lb/>

            towering there awhile upright on his tireless feet, then fell <lb/>
            at last with mighty crash, a strengthless mass. So then <lb/>
            the heroes spent that night after all in Crete; and after <lb/>
            that, just as dawn was growing bright, they built a temple <lb/>
            to Miuoan Athene, and drew water and embarked, that <lb/>
            they might row as soon as possible beyond the headland of <lb/>
            Salmoneus.1</p>
          <p>Anon, as they were hasting o'er the wide gulf of Crete, <lb/>
            night scared them, that night men call " the shroud of <lb/>
            gloom." No stars nor any ray of the moon pierced through <lb/>
            its horror; but it was black chaos come from heaven, or <lb/>
            haply thick gloom rising from the nethermost abyss. And <lb/>
            they knew not so much as whether they were drifting into <lb/>
            Hades or along the water, but to the sea they committed <lb/>
            their return, not knowing whither it would carry them. <lb/>
            Then Jason, with uplifted hands, cried aloud to Phœbus, <lb/>
            calling on him to save, and his tears ran down in his dis­ <lb/>
            tress ; and he promised he would bring great store of gifts <lb/>
            to Pytho2 and to Amyclæ, and likewise to Ortygia. Lightly <lb/>
            didst thou come, son of Latona, from heaven, in ready re­ <lb/>
            sponse, unto the rocks of Melas, which lie there in the sea, <note type="footnote"> 1 A promontory of Crete. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Pytho, Amyclæ, and Ortygia are various seats of Apollo's worship. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="207"/>
            and on the top of one of the twin peaks thou didst settle, <lb/>
            holding thy golden bow on high in thy right hand; and <lb/>
            the bow flashed a dazzling radiance all around. Then a <lb/>
            little island of the Sporades appeared in sight of them, <lb/>
            fronting the tiny isle of Hippuris; and there they cast <lb/>
            anchor and waited. Anon the dawn arose and showed his <lb/>
            light, and they made for Apollo a noble enclosure and an <lb/>
            altar, with trees above, in a shady grove, calling Phœbus <lb/>
            " radiant god " because of his far-seen radiance ; and the <lb/>
            bare isle called they isle of appearing," for that Phœbus <lb/>
            did there appear to them at their sore need. And they <lb/>
            offered all that men can find to offer on a barren strand ; <lb/>
            and so it was that when Medea's Phæacian damsels saw <lb/>
            them pouring libations of water on the blazing brands, <lb/>
            they could no longer keep back their laughter in their <lb/>
            breasts, for they had ever seen oxen in plenty slain in the <lb/>
            halls of Alcinous. But the heroes, glad at their jesting, <lb/>
            scoffed at them with words of abuse; and among them <lb/>
            rose the merry sound of taunting gibe and raillery; and <lb/>
            from that sport of the heroes the women do strive on this <lb/>
            wise with the men in the island, when they will appease <lb/>
            with sacrifice Apollo, " god of radiance," champion of his <lb/>
            " isle of appearing."</p>
          <p>But when they had loosed their cables thence in calm <lb/>
            weather, then did Euphemus remember a vision he saw in <lb/>
            the night, in awe of the famous son of Maia ;2 for it seemed <lb/>
            to him that that strange clod, held in the palm of his <lb/>
            hand, was being suckled at his breast with white streams <lb/>
            of milk ; and out of the clod, little though it was, grew a <lb/>
            woman, like to a virgin ; and he, o'ercome by strong desire, <lb/>
            lay with her in love's embrace; but in the act he pitied <lb/>
            her as though she were a maiden, whom himself was feed­ <lb/>
            ing with his milk; but she comforted him with soothing <note type="footnote"> 1 A little island called Anaphe, near Thera. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Hermes was the god who sent visions to men. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="208"/>
            words: " Dear husband, I am the daughter of Triton, thy <lb/>
            children's nurse, no maiden I; for Triton and Libya are <lb/>
            my parents. But give me back to the maidens of Nereus, <lb/>
            to dwell within the deep nigh to ' the isle of appearing' ; <lb/>
            and I will come back again to the sun-light, ready to help <lb/>
            thy children." 1</p>
          <p>Of this vision Euphemus now minded him, and he told <lb/>
            it to the son of Æson; and he, when he had pondered <lb/>
            awhile the oracles of Hecatus, uttered his voice, and said : <lb/>
            " Lo! you now; verily there bath fallen to thee a great <lb/>
            and glorious fame. For of yon clod the gods will make an <lb/>
            island for thee, when thou hast cast it into the sea, where <lb/>
            thy children's children in days to come shall dwell; for <lb/>
            Triton did vouchsafe to thee this clod of the Libyan main­ <lb/>
            land as a stranger's gift; 'twas none other than he of the <lb/>
            immortals, who met us and gave thee this."</p>
          <p>So spake he, and Euphemus made not light of the <lb/>
            answer of the son of Æson, but flung the clod into the <lb/>
            deep, cheered at the word of prophecy. Therefrom rose <lb/>
            the isle Calliste,2 holy nurse of the children of Euphemus, <lb/>
            who at first dwelt some time in Sintean Lemnos, but, <lb/>
            being driven from Lemnos by Tyrsenians, they came to <lb/>
            Sparta as suppliants ; and, when they left Sparta, Theras, <lb/>
            goodly son of Autesion, brought them to the isle of Calliste, <lb/>
            and it took the name of Thera from him in exchange for <lb/>
            its own. But these things happened after the time of <lb/>
            Euphemus.</p>
          <p>And when they were gone hence, they sailed steadily <lb/>
            through the boundless swell, and stopped at the beach of <lb/>
            Ægina. Here on a sudden arose an innocent strife among <lb/>
            them about the drawing of water, who should be first to <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">νεπόδεσσιν</foreign> = <foreign xml:lang="grc">τἐκνοις</foreign>, in which sense this word is always used by <lb/>
