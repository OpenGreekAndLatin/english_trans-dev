        <p>As in books on geography, Sossius Senecio, the writers <lb/>
            crowd the countries of which they know nothing into the <lb/>
            furthest margins of their maps, and write upon them <lb/>
            legends such as, " In this direction lie waterless deserts <lb/>
            full of wild beasts;" or, “ Unexplored morasses;" or, <lb/>
            “ Here it is as cold as Scythia ;” or, “ A frozen sea so <lb/>
            I, in my writings on Parallel Lives, go through that <lb/>
            period of time where history rests on the firm basis of <lb/>
            facts, and may truly say, “ All beyond this is portentous <lb/>
            and fabulous, inhabited by poets and mythologers, and <lb/>
            there is nothing true or certain."</p>
          <p>When I had written the lives of Lykurgus the law­ <lb/>
            giver and Numa the king, it appeared to me natural to go <lb/>
            back to Romulus also, as I was engaged on the history of <lb/>
            times so close to his. So when I was reflecting, in the <lb/>
            words of AEschylus, <lb/>
            a Against this chieftain, who can best contend ? <lb/>
            Whom shall I match in fight, what trusty friend ?” <lb/>
            it occurred to me to compare the founder of the fair and <lb/>
            famous city of Athens with him, and to contrast Theseus <lb/>
            with the father of unconquered glorious Rome. Putting <lb/>
            aside, then, the mythological element, let us examine his <lb/>
            story, and wherever it obstinately defies probability, and <lb/>
            cannot be explained by natural agency, let us beg the in­ <lb/>
            dulgence of our readers, who will kindly make allowance <lb/>
            for tales of antiquity. <note type="footnote"> B </note></p><pb n="2"/>
        </div>
        <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2">
          <p>Theseus appears to have several points of resemblance <lb/>
            to Romulus. Both were unacknowledged illegitimate <lb/>
            children, and were reputed to descend from the Gods. <lb/>
            “ Both warriors, well we all do know: <lb/>
            and both were wise as well as powerful. The one founded <lb/>
            Rome, while the other was the joint founder of Athens; <lb/>
            and these are two of the most famous of cities. Both <lb/>
            carried off women by violence, and neither of them escaped <lb/>
            domestic misfortune and retribution, but towards the end <lb/>
            of their lives both were at variance with their countrymen, <lb/>
            if we may put any trust in the least extravagant writings <lb/>
            upon the subject.</p>
        </div>
        <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3">
          <p>Theseus traced his descent on the father's side from <lb/>
            Erechtheus and the original Autocthones,* while on the <lb/>
            mother's side he was descended from Pelops. For Pelops <lb/>
            surpassed all the other princes of the Peloponnesus in the <lb/>
            number of his children as well as in wealth; and of these <lb/>
            he gave many of his daughters in marriage to the chief <lb/>
            men of the country, and established many of his sons as <lb/>
            rulers in various cities. One of these, Pittheus, the grand­ <lb/>
            father of Theseus, founded Trœzen, which is indeed but <lb/>
            a little state, though he had a greater reputation than any <lb/>
            man of his time for eloquence and wisdom. The nature <lb/>
            of this wisdom of his seems to have been much of the <lb/>
            same kind as that which made the reputation of <lb/>
            Hesiod, in the collection of maxims known as the ‘ Works <lb/>
            and Days.' One of these maxims is indeed ascribed to <lb/>
            Pittheus: <lb/>
            “ Let promised pay be truly paid to friends." <lb/>
            At any rate, this is what Aristotle the philosopher has <lb/>
            recorded ; and also Euripides, when he speaks of Hippolytus <lb/>
            as “ child of holy Pittheus," shows the prevailing opinion <lb/>
            about Pittheus. Now Ægeus desired to have children, <lb/>
            and the Oracle at Delphi is said to have given him the <lb/>
            well-known response, forbidding him to have intercourse <note type="footnote"> * Autochthones was the name by which the original citizens of <lb/>
            Athens called themselves, meaning that they were sprung from the <lb/>
            soil itself, not immigrants from some other country. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="3"/>
            with any woman before he reached Athens, but not <lb/>
            appearing to explain this clearly. Consequently, on his <lb/>
            way home, he went to Trœzen, and asked the advice of <lb/>
            Pittheus about the response of the God, which ran thus: <lb/>
            “ Great chief, the wine-skin's foot must closed remain, <lb/>
            Till thou to Athens art returned again." <lb/>
            Pittheus clearly perceived what the oracle must mean, and <lb/>
            persuaded or cheated Ægeus into an intrigue with Æthra. <lb/>
            Afterwards, when he discovered that he had conversed <lb/>
            with the daughter of Pittheus, as he imagined that she <lb/>
            might prove with child, he left behind him his sword and <lb/>
            sandals hidden under a great stone, which had a hollow <lb/>
            inside it exactly fitting them. This he told to AEthra <lb/>
            alone, and charged her if a son of his should be born, and <lb/>
            on growing to man's estate should be able to lift the stone <lb/>
            and take from under it the deposit, that she should send <lb/>
            him at once with these things to himself, in all secrecy, <lb/>
            and as far as possible concealing his journey from obser­ <lb/>
            vation. For he greatly feared the sons of Pallas, who <lb/>
            plotted against him, and despised him on account of his <lb/>
            childlessness, they themselves being fifty brothers, all the <lb/>
            sons of Pallas.</p>
        </div>
        <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4">
          <p>When Æthra's child was born, some writers say <lb/>
            that he was at once named Theseus, from the tokens <lb/>
            placed under the stone; others say that he was afterwards <lb/>
            so named at Athens, when Ægeus acknowledged him as <lb/>
            his son. He was brought up by his grandfather Pittheus, <lb/>
            and had a master and tutor, Konnidas, to whom even to <lb/>
            the present day, the Athenians sacrifice a ram on the day <lb/>
            before the feast of Theseus, a mark of respect which is <lb/>
            much more justly due to him, than those which they pay <lb/>
            to Silanion and Parrhasius, who have only made pictures <lb/>
            and statues of Theseus.</p>
          </div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5">
<p>As it was at that period still the custom for those <lb/>
            who were coming to man's estate to go to Delphi and offer <lb/>
            to the god the first-fruits of their hair (which was then <lb/>
            cut for the first time),* Theseus went to Delphi, and they <note type="footnote">* The first cutting of the hair was always an occasion of solemnity <lb/>
            among the Greeks, the hair being dedicated to some god. The first <lb/>
            instance of this is in Homer's Iliad, where Achilles speaks of having </note> <note type="footnote"> B 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="4"/>
            say that a place there is even to this day named after him. <lb/>
            But he only cut the front part of his hair, as Homer tells <lb/>
            us the Abantes did, and this fashion of cutting the hair <lb/>
            was called Theseus's fashion because of him. The Abantes <lb/>
            first began to cut their hair in this manner, not having, as <lb/>
            some say, been taught to do so by the Arabians, nor yet <lb/>
            from any wish to imitate the Mysians, but because they <lb/>
            were a warlike race, and met their foes in close combat, <lb/>
            and studied above all to come to a hand-to-hand fight with <lb/>
            their enemy, as Archilochus bears witness in his verses: <lb/>
            “ They use no slings nor bows, <lb/>
            Eubœa's martial lords, <lb/>
            But hand to hand they close <lb/>
            And conquer with their swords.” <lb/>
            So they cut their hair short in front, that their enemies <lb/>
            might not grasp it. And they say that Alexander of <lb/>
            Macedon for the same reason ordered his generals to have <lb/>
            the beards of the Macedonians shaved, because they were <lb/>
            a convenient handle for the enemy to grasp.</p>
          </div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6">
<p>Now while he was yet a child, Æthra concealed <lb/>
            the real parentage of Theseus, and a story was circulated <lb/>
            by Pittheus that his father was Poseidon. For the people <lb/>
            of Trœzen have an especial reverence for Poseidon; he is <lb/>
            their tutelar deity; to him they offer first-fruits of their <lb/>
            harvest, and they stamp their money with the trident <lb/>
            as their badge. But when he was grown into a youth, <lb/>
            and proved both strong in body and of good sound sense, <lb/>
            then AEthra led him to the stone, told him the truth <lb/>
            about his father, and bade him take the tokens from <lb/>
            beneath it and sail to Athens with them. He easily lifted <lb/>
            the stone, but determined not to go to Athens by sea, <lb/>
            though the voyage was a safe and easy one, and though <lb/>
            his mother and his grandfather implored him to go that <lb/>
            way. By land it was a difficult matter to react Athens, <lb/>
            as the whole way was infested with robbers and bandits. <lb/>
            That time, it seems, produced men of great and un­ <lb/>
            wearied strength and swiftness, who made no good use of <note type="footnote"> dedicated his hair to the river Spercheius. The Athenian youth <lb/>
            offered their hair to Herakles. The Roman emperor Nero, in latef <lb/>
            times, imitated this custom. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="5"/>
            these powers, but treated all men with overbearing inso­ <lb/>
            lence, taking advantage of their strength to overpower <lb/>
            and slay all who fell into their hands, and disregarding <lb/>
            justice and right and kindly feeling, which they said <lb/>
            were only approved of by those who dared not do injury <lb/>
            to others, or feared to be injured themselves, while men <lb/>
            who could get the upper hand by force might disregard <lb/>
            them. Of these ruffians, Herakles in his wanderings cut <lb/>
            off a good many, but others had escaped him by concealing <lb/>
            themselves, or had been contemptuously spared by him on <lb/>
            account of their insignificance. But Herakles had the mis­ <lb/>
            fortune to kill Iphitus, and thereupon sailed to Lydia and <lb/>
            was for a long time a slave in that country under Omphale, <lb/>
            which condition he had imposed upon himself as a penance <lb/>
            for the murder of his friend. During this period the <lb/>
            country of Lydia enjoyed peace and repose; but in Greece <lb/>
            the old plague of brigandage broke out afresh, as there <lb/>
            was now no one to put it down. So that the journey <lb/>
            overland to Athens from Peloponnesus was full of peril; <lb/>
            and Pittheus, by relating to Theseus who each of these <lb/>
            evildoers was, and how they treated strangers, tried to <lb/>
            prevail upon him to go by sea. But it appears that <lb/>
            Theseus had for a long time in his heart been excited by <lb/>
            the renown of Herakles for courage: he thought more <lb/>
            of him than of any one else, and loved above all to listen <lb/>
            to those who talked of him, especially if they had seen <lb/>
            and spoken to him. Now he could no longer conceal that <lb/>
            he was in the same condition as Themistokles in later <lb/>
            times, when he said that the trophy of Miltiades would <lb/>
            not let him sleep. Just so did the admiration which <lb/>
            Theseus conceived for Herakles make him dream by night <lb/>
            of his great exploits, and by day determine to equal them <lb/>
            by similar achievements of his own.</p>
          </div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="7">
<p>As it happened, they were connected, being second <lb/>
            cousins; for AEthra was the daughter of Pittheus, and <lb/>
            Alkmena the daughter of Lysidike, and Lysidike and <lb/>
            Pittheus were brother and sister, being the children of <lb/>
            Pelops and Hippodameia. So Theseus thought that it <lb/>
            would be a great and unbearable disgrace to him that his <lb/>
            cousin should go everywhere and clear the sea and land <lb/>
            of the brigands who infested them, and he should refuse <lb/>
             <pb n="6"/>
            to undertake the adventures that came in his way; throw­ <lb/>
            ing discredit upon his reputed father by a pusillanimous <lb/>
            flight by sea, and upon his real father by bringing him <lb/>
            only the sandals and an unfleshed sword, and not proving <lb/>
            his noble birth by the evidence of some brave deed accom­ <lb/>
            plished by him. In this spirit he set out on his journey, <lb/>
            with the intention of doing wrong to no one, but of <lb/>
            avenging himself on any one who offered wrong to him.</p>
          </div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="8">
<p>And first in Epidaurus he slew Periphetes, who <lb/>
            used a club as his weapon, and on this account was called <lb/>
            the club-bearer, because he laid hands upon him and <lb/>
            forbade him to proceed farther on his way. The club took &lt; <lb/>
            his fancy, and he adopted it as a weapon, and always used <lb/>
            it, just as Herakles used his lion's skin; for the skin was <lb/>
            a proof of how huge a beast the wearer had overcome, <lb/>
            while the club, invincible in the hands of Theseus, had <lb/>
            yet been worsted when used against him. At the Isthmus <lb/>
            he destroyed Sinis the Pine-bender by the very device by <lb/>
            which he had slain so many people, and that too without <lb/>
            having ever practised the art, proving that true valour <lb/>
            is better than practice and training. Sinis had a daughter, <lb/>
            a tall and beautiful girl, named Perigoune. When her <lb/>
            father fell she ran and hid herself. Theseus sought her <lb/>
            everywhere, but she fled into a place where wild asparagus <lb/>
            grew thick, and with a simple child-like faith besought the <lb/>
            plants to conceal her, as if they could understand her words, <lb/>
            promising that if they did so she never would destroy or <lb/>
            burn them. However, when Theseus called to her, pledging <lb/>
            himself to take care of her and do her no hurt, she came <lb/>
            out, and afterwards bore Theseus a son, named Melanippus. <lb/>
            She afterwards was given by Theseus in marriage to <lb/>
            Deioneus, the son of Eurytus of Œchalia. Ioxus, a son of <lb/>
            Melanippus, and Theseus's grandchild, took part in <lb/>
            Ornytus's settlement in Caria; and for this reason the <lb/>
            descendants of Ioxus have a family custom not to burn <lb/>
            the asparagus plant, but to reverence and worship it.</p>

<p>Now the wild sow of Krommyon, whom they called 1 <lb/>

<p>Before coming to Megara he slew Skeiron by flinging <lb/>
            him down a precipice into the sea, so the story runs, <lb/>
            because he was a robber, but some say that from arrogance <lb/>
            he used to hold out his feet to strangers and bid them <lb/>
            wash them, and that then he kicked the washers into the <lb/>
            sea. But Megarian writers, in opposition to common <lb/>
            tradition, and, as Simonides says, “ warring with all <lb/>
            antiquity," say that Skeiron was not an arrogant brigand, <lb/>
            but repressed brigandage, loved those who were good and <lb/>
            just, and was related to them. For, they point out, Æakus <lb/>
            is thought to have been the most righteous of all the <lb/>
            Greeks, and Kychreus of Salamis was worshipped as a <lb/>
            god, and the virtue of Peleus and Telamon is known to <lb/>
            all. Yet Skeiron was the son-in-law of Kychreus, and <lb/>
            father-in-law of Æakus, and grandfather of Peleus and <lb/>
            Telamon, who were both of them sons of Endeis, the <lb/>
            daughter of Skeiron and his wife Chariklo. It is not then <lb/>
            reasonable to suppose that these, the noblest men of their <lb/>
            time, would make alliances with a malefactor, and give <lb/>
            and receive from him what they prized most dearly. But <lb/>
            they say that Theseus slew Skeiron, not when he first <lb/>
            went to Athens, but that afterwards he took the town of <lb/>
            Eleusis which belonged to the Megarians, by dealing <lb/>
            treacherously with Dickies, who was the chief magistrate <lb/>
            there, and that on that occasion he killed Skeiron. This <lb/>
            is what tradition says on both sides.</p>

<p>At Eleusis Theseus overcame Kerkyon of Arcadia in <lb/>

            to fit the bodies of strangers to it. This he did in imita­ <lb/>

            the same treatment which they intended for him. Thus <lb/>
            Herakles offered up Busiris as a sacrifice, and overcame <lb/>

<p>As he proceeded on his way, and reached the <lb/>
            river Kephisus, men of the Phytalid race were the first to <lb/>
            meet and greet him. He demanded to be purified from <lb/>
            the guilt of bloodshed, and they purified him, made pro­ <lb/>
            pitiatory offerings, and also entertained him in their <lb/>
            houses, being the first persons from whom he had received <lb/>
            any kindness on his journey. It is said to have been on <lb/>
            the eighth day of the month Kronion, which is now called <lb/>
            Hekatombeion, that he came to his own city. On entering <lb/>
            it he found public affairs disturbed by factions, and the <lb/>
            house of Ægeus in great disorder; for Medea, who had <lb/>
            been banished from Corinth, was living with Ægeus, and <lb/>
            had engaged by her drugs to enable Ægeus to have <lb/>
            children. She was the first to discover who Theseus was, <lb/>
            while Ægeus, who was an old man, and feared every one <lb/>
            because of the disturbed state of society, did not recognise <lb/>
            him. Consequently she advised Ægeus to invite him to a <lb/>
            feast. that she might poison him. Theseus accordingly <lb/>
            came to Ægeus's table. He did not wish to be the first to <lb/>
            tell his name, but, to give his father an opportunity of <lb/>
            recognising him, he drew his sword, as if he meant to cut <lb/>
            some of the meat with it, and showed it to Ægeus. <lb/>
            Ægeus at once recognised it, overset the cup of poison, <lb/>
            looked closely at his son and embraced him. He then <lb/>
            called a public meeting and made Theseus known as his <lb/>
            son to the citizens, with whom he was already very popular <lb/>
            because of his bravery. It is said that when the cup was <lb/>
            overset the poison was spilt in the place where now there <lb/>
            is the enclosure in the Delphinium, for there Ægeus dwelt; <lb/>

            Dividing themselves into two bodies, the one proceeded to <lb/>
            march openly upon the city from Sphettus, under the com­ <lb/>
            mand of PaRas their father, while the other lay in ambush <lb/>

<p>Now Theseus, who wished for employment, and <lb/>

<p>Shortly after this the ship from Crete arrived for <lb/>
            the third time to collect the customary tribute. Most <lb/>
            writers agree that the origin of this was, that on the death <lb/>
            of Androgens, in Attica, which was ascribed to treachery, <lb/>
            his father Minos went to war, and wrought much evil to <lb/>
            the country, which at the same time was afflicted by <lb/>
            scourges from Heaven (for the land did not bear fruit, and <lb/>
            there was a great pestilence and the rivers sank into the <lb/>
            earth). So that as the oracle told the Athenians that, if <lb/>
            they propitiated Minos and came to terms with him, the <lb/>
            anger of Heaven would cease and they should have a <lb/>
            respite from their sufferings, they sent an embassy to <lb/>
            Minos and prevailed on him to make peace, on the con­ <lb/>
            dition that every nine years they should send him a <lb/>
            tribute of seven youths and seven maidens. The most <lb/>
            tragic of the legends states these poor children when they <lb/>
            reached Crete were thrown into the Labyrinth, and there <lb/>
            either were devoured by the Minotaur or else perished with <lb/>
            hunger, being unable to find the way out. The Minotaur, <lb/>
            as Euripides tells us, was <lb/>
            " A form commingled, and a monstrous birth, <lb/>
            Half man, half bull, in twofold shape combined."</p>
          </div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="16">
<p>Philochorus says that the Cretans do not recog­ <lb/>
            nise this story, but say that the Labyrinth was merely a <lb/>
            prison, like any other, from which escape was impossible, <lb/>
            and that Minos instituted gymnastic games in honour of <lb/>
            Androgeus, in which the prizes for the victors were these <lb/>
            children, who till then were kept in the Labyrinth. Also <lb/>
            they say that the victor in the first contest was a man of <lb/>
            great power in the state, a general of the name of Taurus, <lb/>
            who was of harsh and savage temper, and ill-treated the <lb/>
            Athenian children. And Aristotle himself, in his treatise <lb/>
            on the constitution of the Bottiæans, evidently does not <lb/>
            believe that the children were put to death by Minos, but <lb/>
            that they lived in Crete as slaves, until extreme old age; <lb/>
            and that one day the Cretans, in performance of an ancient <lb/>
            vow, sent first-fruits of their population to Delphi. Among <lb/>
            those who were thus sent were the descendants of the <lb/>
            Athenians, and, as they could not maintain themselves <lb/>
            there, they first passed over to Italy, and there settled <lb/>
             <pb n="11"/>
            near Iapygium, and from thence again removed to Thrace, <lb/>
            and took the name of Bottiæans. For this reason, the <lb/>
            Bottiæan maidens when performing a certain sacrifice <lb/>
            sing “ Let us go to Athens." Thus it seems to be a terrible <lb/>
            thing to incur the hatred of a city powerful in speech and <lb/>
            song ; for on the Attic stage Minos is always vilified and <lb/>
            traduced, and though he was called “ Most Kingly " by <lb/>
            Hesiod, and “ Friend of Zeus " by Homer, it gained him no <lb/>
            credit, but the playwrights overwhelmed him with abuse, <lb/>
            styling him cruel and violent. And yet Minos is said to <lb/>
            have been a king and a lawgiver, and Rhadamanthus to <lb/>
            have been a judge under him, carrying out his decrees.</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="17">
<p>So when the time of the third payment of the <lb/>
            tribute arrived, and those fathers who had sons not yet <lb/>
            grown up had to submit to draw lots, the unhappy people <lb/>
            began to revile Ægeus, complaining that he, although the <lb/>
            author of this calamity, yet took no share in their afflic­ <lb/>
            tion, but endured to see them left childless, robbed of <lb/>
            their own legitimate offspring, while he made a foreigner <lb/>
            and a bastard the heir to his kingdom. This vexed <lb/>
            Theseus, and determining not to hold aloof, but to share the <lb/>
            fortunes of the people, he came forward and offered himself <lb/>
            without being drawn by lot. The people all admired <lb/>
            his courage and patriotism, and Ægeus finding that his <lb/>
            prayers and entreaties had no effect on his unalterable <lb/>
            resolution, proceeded to choose the rest by lot. Hellanikus <lb/>
            says that the city did not select the youths and maidens <lb/>
            by lot, but that Minos himself came thither and chose <lb/>
            them, and that he picked out Theseus first of all, upon <lb/>
            the usual conditions, which were that the Athenians <lb/>
            should furnish a ship, and that the youths should embark <lb/>
            in it and sail with him, not carrying with them any <lb/>
            weapon of war; and that when the Minotaur was slain, <lb/>
            the tribute should cease. Formerly, nO one had any hope <lb/>
            of safety; so they used to send out the ship with a black <lb/>
            sail, as if it were going to a certain doom; but now <lb/>
            Theseus so encouraged his father, and boasted that he <lb/>
            would overcome the Minotaur, that he gave a second sail, <lb/>
            a white one, to the steersman, and charged him on his <lb/>
            return, if Theseus were safe, to hoist the white one, if not, <lb/>
            the black one as a sign of mourning. But Simonides says <lb/>
             <pb n="12"/>
            that it was not a white sail which was given by Ægeus, <lb/>
            but " a scarlet sail embrued in holm oak's juice," and that <lb/>
            this was agreed on by him as the signal of safety. The <lb/>
            ship was steered by Phereklus the son of Amarsyas, <lb/>
            according to Simonides.</p>
          <p>But Philochorus says that Theseus had one Nausithous <lb/>
            sent him from Skirus of Salamis, to steer the ship, and <lb/>
            Phæax to act as look-out, as the Athenians had not yet <lb/>
            turned their attention to the sea.</p>
          <p>One of the youths chosen by lot was Menestheos the <lb/>
            son of Skirus's daughter. The truth of this account is <lb/>
            attested by the shrines of Nausithous and Phæax, which <lb/>
            Theseus built at Phalerum, and by the feast called the <lb/>
            Kybernesia or pilot's festival, which is held in their <lb/>
            honour.</p>
          </div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="18">
<p>When the lots were drawn Theseus brought the <lb/>
            chosen youths from the Prytaneum, and proceeding to the <lb/>
            temple of the Delphian Apollo, offered the suppliants' <lb/>
            bough to Apollo on their behalf. This was a bough of <lb/>
            the sacred olive-tree bound with fillets of white wool. <lb/>

<p>When they reached Crete, according to most <lb/>
            historians and poets, Ariadne fell in love with him, and <lb/>
            from her he received the clue of string, and was taught <lb/>
            how to thread the mazes of the Labyrinth. He slew the <lb/>
            Minotaur, and, taking with him Ariadne and the youths, <lb/>
            sailed away. Pherekydes also says that Theseus also <lb/>
            knocked out the bottoms of the Cretan ships, to prevent <lb/>
            pursuit. But Demon says that Taurus, Minos's general, <lb/>
            was slain in a sea-fight in the harbour, when Theseus <lb/>
            sailed away. But according to Philochorus, when Minos <lb/>
            instituted his games, Taurus was expected to win every <lb/>
            prize, and was grudged this honour; for his great influence <lb/>
            and his unpopular manners made him disliked, and soandal <lb/>

            said, that he was too intimate with Pasiphae. On this <lb/>
            account, when Theseus offered to contend with him, Minos <lb/>
            agreed. And, as it was the custom in Crete for women as <lb/>
            well as men to be spectators of the games, Ariadne was <lb/>
            present, and was struck with the appearance of Theseus, <lb/>
            and his strength, as he conquered all competitors. Minos <lb/>
            was especially pleased, in the wrestling match, at Taurus's <lb/>
            defeat and shame, and, restoring the children to Theseus, <lb/>
            remitted the tribute for the future. Kleidemus tells the <lb/>
            story in his own fashion and at unnecessary length, be­ <lb/>
            ginning much farther back. There was, he says, a <lb/>
            decree passed by all the Greeks, that no ship should sail <lb/>
            from any post with more than five hands on board, but <lb/>
            Jason alone, the master of the great ship Argo, should <lb/>
            cruise about, and keep the sea free of pirates. Now when <lb/>
            Daedalus fled to Athens, Minos, contrary to the decree, <lb/>
            pursued him in long war galleys, and being driven to <lb/>
            Sicily by a storm, died there. When his son Deukalion <lb/>
            sent a warlike message to the Athenians, bidding them <lb/>
            give up Daedalus to him, or else threatening that he <lb/>
            would put to death the children whom Minos had taken <lb/>
            as hostages, Theseus returned him a gentle answer, beg­ <lb/>
            ging for the life of Dædalus, who was his own cousin <lb/>
            and blood relation, being the son of Merope, the daughter <lb/>
            of Erechtheus. But he busied himself with building a <lb/>
            fleet, some of it in Attica, in the country of the Thymai­ <lb/>
            tadae, far from any place of resort of strangers, and some <lb/>
            in Trœzen, under the management of Pittheus, as he did <lb/>
            not wish his preparations to be known. But when the <lb/>
            ships were ready to set sail, having with him as pilots, <lb/>
            Dædalus himself and some Cretan exiles, as no one <lb/>
            knew that he was coming, and the Cretans thought that it <lb/>
            was a friendly fleet that was advancing, he seized the <lb/>
            harbour, and marched at once to Knossus before his arrival <lb/>
            was known. Then he fought a battle at the gates of the <lb/>
            Labyrinth, and slew Deukalion and his body-guard. As <lb/>
            Ariadne now succeeded to the throne, he made peace with <lb/>
            her, took back the youths, and formed an alliance between <lb/>
            the Cretans and the Athenians, in which each nation <lb/>
            swore that it would not begin a war against the other.</p>

<p>There are many more stories about these events, <lb/>
             <pb n="14"/>
            and about Ariadne, none of which agree in any particulars. <lb/>
            Some say that she hanged herself when deserted by <lb/>
            Theseus, and some, that she was taken to Naxos by his <lb/>
            sailors, and there dwelt with Œnarus, the priest of <lb/>
            Dionysus, having been deserted by Theseus, who was in <lb/>
            love with another. <lb/>
            “ For Ægle's love disturbed his breast." <lb/>
            This line, we are told by Hereas of Megara, was struck <lb/>
            out of Hesiod's poems by Peisistratus ; and again he says <lb/>
            that he inserted into Homer's description of the Shades, <lb/>
            a Peirithous and Theseus, born of gods," <lb/>
            to please the Athenians. Some writers say that Theseus <lb/>
            had by Ariadne two sons, Staphylus and Œnopion, whom <lb/>
            Ion of Chios follows when he speaks of his own native <lb/>
            city as that <lb/>
            " Which erst (Enopion stablished, Theseus' son." <lb/>
            The pleasantest of these legends are in nearly every one's <lb/>
            mouth. But Pæon of Amathus gives an account peculiar to <lb/>
            himself, that Theseus was driven by a storm to Cyprus, <lb/>
            and that Ariadne, who was pregnant, suffered much from <lb/>
            the motion of the ship, and became so ill, that she was set <lb/>
            on shore, but Theseus had to return to take charge of the <lb/>
            ship, and was blown off to sea. The women of the country <lb/>
            took care of Ariadne, and comforted her in her bereave­ <lb/>
            ment, even bringing forged letters to her as if from <lb/>
            Theseus, and rendering her assistance during her confine­ <lb/>
            ment ; and when she died in childbirth, they buried her. <lb/>
            Theseus, on his return, grieved much, and left money to <lb/>
            the people of the country, bidding them sacrifice to <lb/>
            Ariadne; he also set up two little statues, one of silver, <lb/>
            and the other of brass. And at this sacrifice, which takes <lb/>
            place on the second day of the month Gorpiæus, one of the <lb/>
            young men lies down on the ground, and imitates the cries <lb/>
            of a woman in travail; and the people of Amathus call <lb/>
            that the grove of Ariadne Aphrodite, in which they show <lb/>
            her tomb.</p>
          <p>But some writers of Naxos tell a different story, peculiar <lb/>
            to themselves, that there were two Minoses and two <lb/>
             <pb n="15"/>
            Ariadnes, of whom one, they say, was married to Dionysus <lb/>
            in Naxos, and was the mother of Staphylus and his brother, <lb/>
            while the younger was carried off by Theseus, and came <lb/>
            to Naxos after he deserted her; and a nurse called Korkyne <lb/>
            came with her, whose tomb they point out. Then Naxians <lb/>
            also says that this Ariadne died there, and is honoured, <lb/>
            but not so much as the elder; for at the feast in honour <lb/>
            of the elder, there are merriment and revelry, but at that <lb/>
            of the younger gloomy rites are mingled with mirth.</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="21">
<p>Theseus, when he sailed away from Croto, touched <lb/>
            at Delos ; here he sacrificed to the god and offered up the <lb/>
            statue of Aphrodite, which Ariadne had given him; and <lb/>
            besides this, he and the youths with him danced a measure <lb/>
            which they say is still practised by the people of Delos to <lb/>
            this day, being an imitation of the turnings and windings <lb/>
            of the Labyrinth expressed by complicated evolutions per­ <lb/>
            formed in regular order. This kind of dance is called by <lb/>
            the Delians “ the crane dance," according to Diksearchus. <lb/>
            It was danced round the altar of the Horns, which is all <lb/>
            formed of horns from the left side. They also say that he <lb/>
            instituted games at Delos, and that then for the first time <lb/>
            a palm was given by him to the victor.</p>

<p>As he approached Attica, both he and his steers­ <lb/>
            man in their delight forgot to hoist the sail which was to <lb/>
            be a signal of their safety to Ægeus ; and he in his despair <lb/>
            flung himself down the cliffs and perished. Theseus, as <lb/>
            soon as he reached the harbour, performed at Phalerum <lb/>
            the sacrifices which he had vowed to the gods if he re­ <lb/>
            turned safe, and sent off a herald to the city with the news <lb/>
            of his safe return. This man met with many who were <lb/>
            lamenting the death of the king, and, as was natural, with <lb/>
            others who were delighted at the news of their safety, and <lb/>
            who congratulated him and wished to crown him with <lb/>
            garlands. These he received, but placed them on his <lb/>
            herald's staff, and when he came back to the seashore, <lb/>
            finding that Theseus had not completed his libation, he <lb/>
            waited outside the temple, not wishing to disturb the <lb/>
            sacrifice. When the libation was finished he announced <lb/>
            the death of Ægeus, and then they all hurried up to the <lb/>
            city with loud lamentations: wherefore to this day, at <lb/>
            the Oschophoria, they say that it is not the herald that is <lb/>
             <pb n="16"/>
            crowned, but his staff, and that at the libations the by­ <lb/>
            standers cry out, “Eleleu, Iou, Iou;" of which cries the <lb/>
            first is used by men in haste, or raising the paean for <lb/>
            battle, while the second is used by persons in surprise and <lb/>
            trouble.</p>
          <p>Theseus, after burying his father, paid his vow to <lb/>
            Apollo, on the seventh day of the month Pyanepsion; for <lb/>
            on this day it was that the rescued youths went up into <lb/>
            the city. The boiling of pulse, which is customary on <lb/>
            this anniversary, is said to be done because the rescued <lb/>
            youths put what remained of their pulse together into one <lb/>
            pot, boiled it all, and merrily feasted on it together. And <lb/>
            on this day also, the Athenians carry about the Eiresione, <lb/>
            a bough of the olive tree garlanded with wool, just as <lb/>
            Theseus had before carried the suppliants' bough, and <lb/>
            covered with first-fruits of all sorts of produce, because the <lb/>
            barrenness of the land ceased on that day; and they sing, <lb/>
            “ Eiresione, bring us figs <lb/>
            And wheaten loaves, and oil, <lb/>
            And wine to quaff, that we may all <lb/>
            Rest merrily from toil."</p>
          <p>However, some say that these ceremonies are performed <lb/>
            in memory of the Herakleidæ, who were thus entertained <lb/>
            by the Athenians; but most writers tell the tale as I have <lb/>
            told it.</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="23">
<p>Now the thirty-oared ship, in which Theseus <lb/>
            sailed with the youths, and came back safe, was kept by <lb/>
            the Athenians up to the time of Demetrius Phalereus. <lb/>
            They constantly removed the decayed part of her timbers. <lb/>
            and renewed them with sound wood, so that the ship <lb/>
            became an illustration to philosophers of the doctrine of <lb/>
            growth and change, as some argued that it remained the <lb/>
            same, and others, that it did not remain the same. The <lb/>
            feast of the Oschophoria, or of carrying boughs, which to <lb/>
            this day the Athenians celebrate, was instituted by <lb/>
            Theseus. For he did not take with him all the maidens <lb/>
            who were drawn by lot, but he chose two youths, his <lb/>
            intimate friends, who were feminine and fair to look upon, <lb/>
            but of manly spirit; those by warm baths and avoiding <lb/>
            the heat of the sun and careful tending of their hair and <lb/>
             <pb n="17"/>
            skin he completely metamorphosed, teaching them to <lb/>
            imitate the voice and carriage and walk of maidens. <lb/>
            These two were then substituted in the place of two of <lb/>
            the girls, and deceived every one; and when they re­ <lb/>
            turned, he and these two youths walked in procession, <lb/>
            dressed as now those who carry boughs at the Oschophoria <lb/>
            are dressed. They carry them in honour of Dionysus and <lb/>
            Ariadne, because of the legend, or rather because they <lb/>
            returned home when the harvest was being gathered in. <lb/>
            And the women called supper-carriers join in carrying <lb/>
            them and partake of the sacrifice, in imitation of the <lb/>
            mothers of those who were drawn by lot; for they used <lb/>
            continually to bring their children food. Also, old tales <lb/>
            are told, because these women used to tell their children <lb/>
            such ones, to encourage and amuse them.</p>
          <p>These things are related by the historian Demus. <lb/>
            Moreover, a sacred enclosure was dedicated to Theseus, <lb/>
            and those families out of whom the tribute of the children <lb/>
            had been gathered were bidden to contribute to sacrifices <lb/>
            to him. These sacrifices were presided over by the <lb/>
            Phytalidæ, which post Theseus bestowed upon them as a <lb/>
            recompense for their hospitality towards him.</p>
          </div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="24">
<p>After the death of Ægeus, Theseus conceived a <lb/>
            great and important design. He gathered together all <lb/>
            the inhabitants of Attica and made them citizens of one <lb/>
            city, whereas before they had lived dispersed, so as to be <lb/>
            hard to assemble together for the common weal, and at <lb/>
            times even fighting with one another.</p>
          <p>He visited all the villages and tribes, and won their <lb/>
            consent; the poor and lower classes gladly accepting his <lb/>
            proposals, while he gained over the more powerful by <lb/>
            promising that the new constitution should not include a <lb/>
            king, but that it should be a pure commonwealth, with <lb/>
            himself merely acting as general of its army and guardian <lb/>
            of its laws, while in other respects it would allow perfect <lb/>
            freedom and equality to every one. By these arguments <lb/>
            he convinced some of them, and the rest knowing his <lb/>
            power and courage chose rather to be persuaded than <lb/>
            forced into compliance. He therefore destroyed the pry­ <lb/>
            taneia, the senate house, and the magistracy of each <lb/>
            individual township, built one common prytaneum and <note type="footnote"> a </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="18"/>
            senate house for them all on the site of the present <lb/>
            acropolis, called the city Athens, and instituted the <lb/>
            Panathenaic festival common to all of them. He also <lb/>
            instituted a festival for the resident aliens, on the six­ <lb/>
            teenth of the month, Hekatombeion, which is still kept <lb/>
            up. And having, according to his promise, laid down his <lb/>
            sovereign power, he arranged the new constitution under <lb/>
            the auspices of the gods ; for he made inquiry at Delphi <lb/>
            as to how he should deal with the city, and received the <lb/>
            following answer: <lb/>
            “ Thou son of Ægeus and of Pittheus’ maid, <lb/>
            My father hath within thy city laid <lb/>
            The bounds of many cities ; weigh not down <lb/>
            Thy soul with thought; the bladder cannot drown."</p>
          <p>The same thing they say was afterwards prophesied by <lb/>
            the Sibyl concerning the city, in these words : <lb/>
            " The bladder may be dipped, but cannot drown."</p>
          </div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="25">
<p>Wishing still further to increase the number of <lb/>
            his citizens, he invited all strangers to come and share <lb/>
            equal privileges, and they say that the words now used, <lb/>
            " Come hither all ye peoples," was the proclamation then <lb/>
            used by Theseus, establishing as it were a commonwealth <lb/>
            of all natiors. But he did not permit his state to fall <lb/>
            into the disorder which this influx of all kinds of people <lb/>
            would probably have produced, but divided the people into <lb/>
            three classes, of Eupatridæ or nobles, Geomori or farmers, <lb/>
            Demiurgi or artisans. To the Eupatridæ he assigned the <lb/>
            care of religious rites, the supply of magistrates for the <lb/>
            city, and the interpretation of the laws and customs sacred <lb/>
            or profane, yet he placed them on an equality with the <lb/>
            other citizens, thinking that the nobles would always excel <lb/>
            in dignity, the farmers in usefulness, and the artisans in <lb/>
            numbers. Aristotle tells us that he was the first who <lb/>
            inclined to democracy, and gave up the title of king ; and <lb/>
            Homer seems to confirm this view by speaking of the <lb/>
            people of the Athenians alone of all the states men­ <lb/>
            tioned in his catalogue of ships. Theseus also struck <lb/>
            money with the figure of a bull, either alluding to the <lb/>
            bull of Marathon, or Taurus, Minos' general, or else to <lb/>
             <pb n="19"/>
            encourage farming among the citizens. Hence they say <lb/>
            came the words, " worth ten," or " worth a hundred oxen." <lb/>
            He permanently annexed Megara to Attica, and set up the <lb/>
            famous pillar on the Isthmus, on which he wrote the <lb/>
            distinction between the countries in two trimeter lines, of <lb/>
            which the one looking east says, <lb/>
            “ This is not Peloponnesus, but Ionia, <lb/>
            and the one looking west says, <lb/>
            “ This is Peloponnesus, not Ionia." <lb/>
            And also he instituted games there, in emulation of <lb/>
            Herakles; that, just as Herakles had ordained that the <lb/>
            Greeks should celebrate the Olympic games in honour <lb/>
            of Zeus, so by Theseus's appointment they should celebrate <lb/>
            the Isthmian games in honour of Poseidon.</p>
          <p>The festival which was previously established there in <lb/>
            honour of Melikerta used to be celebrated by night, and to <lb/>
            be more like a religious mystery than a great spectacle and <lb/>
            gathering. Some writers assert that the Isthmian games <lb/>
            were established in honour of Skeiron, and that Theseus <lb/>
            wished to make them an atonement for the murder of his <lb/>
            kinsman; for Skeiron was the son of Kanethus and of <lb/>
            Henioche the daughter of Pittheus. Others say that this <lb/>
            festival was established in honour of Sinis, not of Skeiron. <lb/>
            Be this as it may, Theseus established it, and stipulated <lb/>
            with the Corinthians that visitors from Athens who came <lb/>
            to the games should have a seat of honour in as large a space <lb/>
            as could be covered by a sail of the public ship which <lb/>
            carried them, when stretched out on the ground. This <lb/>
            we are told by Hellanikus and Andron of Halikarnassus.</p>
          </div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="26">
<p>Besides this, according to Philochorus and other <lb/>
            writers, he sailed with Herakles to the Euxine, took part <lb/>
            in the campaign against the Amazons, and received <lb/>
            Antiope as the reward for his valour; but most historians, <lb/>
            among whom are Pherekydes, Hellanikus, and Herodorus, <lb/>
            say that Theseus made an expedition of his own later than <lb/>
            that of Herakles, and that he took the Amazon captive, <lb/>
            which is a more reasonable story. For no one of his <lb/>
            companions is said to have captured an Amazon; while <note type="footnote"> c 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="20"/>
            Bion relates that he caught this one by treachery and <lb/>
            carried her off; for the Amazons, he says, were not averse <lb/>
            to men, and did not avoid Theseus when he touched at <lb/>
            their coast, but even offered him presents. He invited <lb/>
            the bearer of these on board his ship ; and when she had <lb/>
            embarked he set sail. But one, Menekrates, who has <lb/>
            written a history of the town of Nikæa in Bithynia, states <lb/>
            that Theseus spent a long time in that country with <lb/>
            Antiope, and that there were three young Athenians, <lb/>
            brothers, who were his companions in arms, by name <lb/>
            Euneon, Thoas, and Soloeis. Soloeis fell in love with <lb/>
            Antiope, and, without telling his brothers, confided his <lb/>
            passion to one of his comrades. This man laid the mat­ <lb/>
            ter before Antiope, who firmly rejected his pretensions, <lb/>
            but treated him quietly and discreetly, telling Theseus <lb/>
            nothing about it. Soloeis, in despair at his rejection, <lb/>
            leaped into a river and perished; and Theseus then at <lb/>
            length learned the cause of the young man's death. In <lb/>
            his sorrow he remembered and applied to himself an <lb/>
            oracle he had received from Delphi. It had been enjoined <lb/>
            upon him by the Pythia that whenever he should be <lb/>
            struck down with special sorrow in a foreign land, <lb/>
            he should found a city in that place and leave some of <lb/>
            his companions there as its chiefs. In consequence of <lb/>
            this the city which he founded was called Pythopolis, in <lb/>
            honour of the Pythian Apollo, and the neighbouring river <lb/>
            was called Soloeis, after the youth who died in it. He <lb/>
            left there the brothers of Soloeis as the chiefs and law­ <lb/>
            givers of the new city, and together, with them one <lb/>
            Hermus, an Athenian Eupatrid. In consequence of this, <lb/>
            the people of Pythopolis call a certain place in thoir city <lb/>
            the house of Hermes, by a mistaken accentuation transfer­ <lb/>
            ring the honour due to their founder, to their god Hermes.</p>

<p>This was the origin of the war with the <lb/>
            Amazons; and it seems to have been carried on in no <lb/>
            feeble or womanish spirit, for they never could have <lb/>
            encamped in the city nor have fought a battle close to <lb/>
            the Pnyx and the Museum unless they had conquered the <lb/>
            rest of the country, so as to be able to approach the city <lb/>
            safely. It is hard to believe, as Hellanikus relates, that <lb/>
            they crossed the Cimmerian Bosphorus on the ice; but <lb/>
             <pb n="21"/>
            that they encamped almost in the city is borne witness <lb/>
            to by the local names, and by the tombs of the fallen. <lb/>
            For a long time both parties held aloof, unwilling to <lb/>
            engage; but at last Theseus, after sacrificing to Phobos <lb/>
            (Fear), attacked them. The battle took place in the <lb/>
            month Boedromion, on the day on which the Athenians <lb/>
            celebrate the feast Boedromia. Kleidemus gives us accurate <lb/>
            details, stating that the left wing of the Amazons stood <lb/>
            at the place now called the Amazoneum, while the right <lb/>
            reached up to the Pnyx, at the place where the gilded <lb/>
            figure of Victory now stands. The Athenians attacked <lb/>
            them on this side, issuing from the Museum, and the <lb/>
            tombs of the fallen are to be seen along the street <lb/>
            which leads to the gate near the shrine of the hero <lb/>
            Chalkodus, which is called the Peiræic gate. On this side <lb/>
            the women forced them back as far as the temple of the <lb/>
            Eumenides, but on the other side those who assailed them <lb/>
            from the temple of Pallas, Ardettus, and the Lyceum, <lb/>
            drove their right wing in confusion back to their camp <lb/>
            with great slaughter. In the fourth month of the war <lb/>
            a peace was brought about by Hippolyte; for this writer <lb/>
            names the wife of Theseus Hippolyte, not Antiope. Some <lb/>
            relate that she was slain fighting by the side of Theseus <lb/>
            by a javelin hurled by one Molpadia, and that the column <lb/>
            which stands beside the temple of Olympian Earth is <lb/>
            sacred to her memory. It is not to be wondered at that <lb/>
            history should be at fault when dealing with such ancient <lb/>
            events as these, for there is another story at variance <lb/>
            with this, to the effect that Antiope caused the wounded <lb/>
            Amazons to be secretly transported to Chalkis, where they <lb/>
            were taken care of, and some of them were buried there, <lb/>
            at what is now called the Amazoneum. However, it is <lb/>
            a proof of the war having ended in a treaty of peace, that <lb/>
            the place near the temple of Theseus where they swore <lb/>
            to observe it, is still called Horcomosium, and that the <lb/>
            sacrifice to the Amazons always has taken place before the <lb/>
            festival of Theseus. The people of Megara also show a <lb/>
            burying-place of the Amazons, as one goes from the <lb/>
            market-place to what they call Rhus, where the lozenge­ <lb/>
            shaped building stands. It is said that some others died <lb/>
            at Chaeronea, and were buried bv the little stream which <lb/>
             <pb n="22"/>
            it seems was anciently called Thermodon, but now is <lb/>
            called Hæmon, about which we have treated in the life <lb/>
            of Demosthenes. It would appear that the Amazons <lb/>
            did not even get across Thessaly without trouble, for <lb/>
            graves of them are shown to this day at Skotussa and <lb/>
            Kynoskephalæ.</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="28">
<p>The above is all that is worthy of mention <lb/>
            about the Amazons ; for, as to the story which the author <lb/>
            of the ‘ Theseid' relates about this attack of the Amazons <lb/>
            being brought about by Antiope to revenge herself upon <lb/>
            Theseus for his marriage with Phædra, and how she and <lb/>
            her Amazons fought, and how Herakles slew them, all this <lb/>
            is clearly fabulous. After the death of Antiope, Theseus <lb/>
            married Phædra, having a son by Antiope named Hip­ <lb/>
            polytus, or Demophoon, according to Pindar. As for his <lb/>
            misfortunes with this wife and son, as the account given <lb/>
            by historians does not differ from that which appears in <lb/>
            the plays of the tragic poets, we must believe them to <lb/>
            have happened as all these writers say.</p>
          </div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="29">
<p>However, there are certain other legends about <lb/>
            Theseus' marriage which have never appeared on the <lb/>
            stage, which have neither a creditable beginning nor a <lb/>
            prosperous termination: for it is said that he carried off <lb/>
            one Anaxo, a Trcezenian girl, and after slaying Sinis and <lb/>
            Kerkyon he forced their daughters, and that he married <lb/>
            Periboea the mother of Ajax and also Pherebcea and lope <lb/>
            the daughter of Iphikles : and, as has been told already, <lb/>
            it was on account of his love for Ægle the daughter of <lb/>
            Panopeus that he deserted Ariadne, which was a shameful <lb/>
            and discreditable action. And in addition to all this he <lb/>
            is charged with carrying off Helen, which brought war <lb/>
            upon Attica, and exile and destruction on himself; about <lb/>
            which we shall speak presently. But, though many <lb/>
            adventures were undertaken by the heroes of those times, <lb/>
            Herodorus is of opinion that Theseus took no part in any <lb/>
            of them, except with the Lapithae in their fight with the <lb/>
            Centaurs; though other writers say that he went to <lb/>
            Kolchis with Jason and took part with Meleager in the <lb/>
            hunt of the Kalydonian boar.</p>
          <p>From these legends arises the proverb, “ Not with­ <lb/>
            out Theseus;” also he by himself without any comrades <lb/>
             <pb n="23"/>
            performed many glorious deeds, from which the saying <lb/>
            came into vogue, " This is another Herakles."</p>
          <p>Theseus, together with Adrastus, effected the recovery <lb/>
            of the bodies of those who fell under the walls of the <lb/>
            Cadmea at Thebes, not after conquering the Thebans, as <lb/>
            Euripides puts it in his play, but by a truce and conven­ <lb/>
            tion, according to most writers. Philochorus even states <lb/>
            that this was the first occasion on which a truce was made <lb/>
            for the recovery of those slain in battle. But we have <lb/>
            shown in our ‘ Life of Herakles' that he was the first to <lb/>
            restore the corpses of the slain to the enemy. The tombs <lb/>
            of the rank and file are to be seen at Eleutheræ, but those <lb/>
            of the chiefs at Eleusis, by favour of Theseus to Adrastus. <lb/>
            Euripides's play of the ‘ Suppliants' is contradicted by <lb/>
            that of AEschylus, the ‘ Eleusinians,' in which Theseus is <lb/>
            introduced giving orders for this to be done.</p>
          </div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="30">
<p>His friendship for Peirithous is said to have <lb/>
            arisen in the following manner : He had a great reputa­ <lb/>
            tion for strength and courage; Peirithous, wishing to <lb/>
            make trial of these, drove his cattle away from the plain of <lb/>
            Marathon, and when he learned that Theseus was pursu­ <lb/>
            ing them, armed, he did not retire, but turned and faced <lb/>
            him. Each man then admiring the beauty and courage of <lb/>
            his opponent, refrained from battle, and first Peirithous <lb/>
            holding out his hand bade Theseus himself assess the <lb/>
            damages of his raid upon the cattle, saying that he himself <lb/>
            would willingly submit to whatever penalty the other <lb/>
            might inflict. Theseus thought no more of their quarrel, <lb/>
            and invited him to become his friend and comrade; and <lb/>
            they ratified their compact of friendship by an oath. <lb/>
            Hereupon, Peirithous, who was about to marry Deidameia, <lb/>
            begged Theseus to come and visit his country and meet <lb/>
            the Lapithæ. He also had invited the Centaurs to the <lb/>
            banquet; and as they in their drunken insolence laid <lb/>
            hands upon the women, the Lapithæ attacked them. <lb/>
            Some of them they slew, and the rest they overcame, and <lb/>
            afterwards, with the assistance of Theseus, banished from <lb/>
            their country. Herodorus, however, says that this is not <lb/>
            how these events took place, but that the war was going <lb/>
            on, and that Theseus went to help the Lapithæ and while <lb/>
            on his way thither first beheld Herakles, whom he made <lb/>
             <pb n="24"/>
            a point of visiting at Trachis, where he was resting aftei <lb/>
            his labours and wanderings; and that they met with <lb/>
            many compliments and much good feeling on both sides. <lb/>
            But one would more incline to those writers who tell us <lb/>
            that they often met, and that Herakles was initiated by <lb/>
            Theseus's desire, and was also purified before initiation at <lb/>
            his instance, which ceremony was necessary because of <lb/>
            some reckless action.</p>
          </div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="31">
<p>Theseus was fifty years old, according to <lb/>
            Hellanikus, when he carried off Helen, who was a mere <lb/>
            child. For this reason some who wish to clear him of <lb/>
            this, the heaviest of all the charges against him, say that <lb/>
            it was not he who carried off Helen, but that Idas and <lb/>
            Lynkeus carried her off and deposited her in his keeping. <lb/>
            Afterwards the Twin Brethren came and demanded her <lb/>
            back, but he would not give her up; or even it is said <lb/>
            that Tyndareus himself handed her over to him, because <lb/>
            he feared that Enarsphorus the son of Hippocoon would <lb/>
            take her by force, she being only a child at the time. <lb/>
            But the most probable story and that which most writers <lb/>
            agree in is the following: The two friends, Theseus and <lb/>
            Peirithous, came to Sparta, seized the maiden, who was <lb/>
            dancing in the temple of Artemis Orthia, and carried her <lb/>
            off. As the pursuers followed no farther than Tegea, <lb/>
            they felt no alarm, but leisurely travelled through <lb/>
            Peloponnesus, and made a compact that whichever of them <lb/>
            should win Helen by lot was to have her to wife, but <lb/>
            must help the other to a marriage. They cast lots on this <lb/>
            understanding, and Theseus won. As the maiden was <lb/>
            not yet ripe for marriage he took her with him to <lb/>
            Aphidnæ, and there placing his mother with her gave <lb/>
            her into the charge of his friend Aphidnus, bidding him <lb/>
            watch over her and keep her presence secret. He himself <lb/>
            in order to repay his obligation to Peirithous went on a <lb/>
            journey with him to Epirus to obtain the daughter of <lb/>
            Aidoneus the king of the Molossians, who called his wife <lb/>
            Persephone, his daughter Kore, and his clog Cerberus. <lb/>
            All the suitors of his daughter were bidden by him to <lb/>
            fight this dog, and the victor was to receive her hand. <lb/>
            However, as he learned that Peirithous and his friend <lb/>
            were come, not as wooers, but as ravishers, he cast them <lb/>
             <pb n="25"/>
            into prison. He put an end to Peirithous at once, by <lb/>
            means of his dog, but only guarded Theseus strictly.</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="32">
<p>Now at this period Mnestheus, the son of <lb/>
            Peteus, who was the son of Omeus, who was the son of <lb/>
            Erechtheus, first of all mankind they say took to the arts <lb/>
            of a demagogue, and to currying favour with the people. <lb/>
            This man formed a league of the nobles, who had long <lb/>
            borne Theseus a grudge for having destroyed the local <lb/>
            jurisdiction and privileges of each of the Eupatrids by <lb/>
            collecting them all together into the capital, where they <lb/>
            were no more than his subjects and slaves; and he also <lb/>
            excited the common people by telling them that although <lb/>
            they were enjoying a fancied freedom they really had been <lb/>
            deprived of their ancestral privileges and sacred rites, and <lb/>
            made to endure the rule of one foreign despot, instead of <lb/>
            that of many good kings of their own blood.</p>
          <p>While he was thus busily employed, the invasion of <lb/>
            Attica by the sons of Tyndareus greatly assisted his <lb/>
            revolutionary scheme; so that some say that it was he <lb/>
            who invited them to come. At first they abstained from <lb/>
            violence, and confined themselves to asking that their <lb/>
            sister Helen should be given up to them ; but when they <lb/>
            were told by the citizens that she was not in their hands, <lb/>
            and that they knew not where she was, they proceeded to <lb/>
            warlike measures. Akademus, who had by some means <lb/>
            discovered that she was concealed at Aphidnae, now told <lb/>
            them where she was; for which cause he was honoured <lb/>
            by the sons of Tyndareus during his life, and also the <lb/>
            Lacedæmonians, though they often invaded the country <lb/>
            and ravaged it unsparingly, yet never touched the place <lb/>
            called the Akademeia, for Akademus's sake. Dikæarchus <lb/>
            says that Echemus and Marathus, two Arcadians, took <lb/>
            part in that war with the sons of Tyndareus; and that from <lb/>
            the first the place now called Akademeia was then named <lb/>
            Echedemia, and that from the second the township of <lb/>
            Marathon takes its names, because he in accordance with <lb/>
            some oracle voluntarily offered himself as a sacrifice there <lb/>
            in the sight of the whole army.</p>
          <p>However, the sons of Tyndareus came to Aphidnæ, and <lb/>
            took the place after a battle, in which it is said that <lb/>
            Alykus fell, the son of Skeiron, who then was fighting on <lb/>
             <pb n="26"/>
            the side of the Dioskuri. In memory of this man it is <lb/>
            said that the place in the territory of Megara where his <lb/>
            remains lie is called Alykus. But Hereas writes that <lb/>
            Alykus was slain by Theseus at Aphidnæ, and as evidence <lb/>
            he quotes this verse about Alykus, <lb/>
            “ Him whom Theseus slew in the spacious streets of Aphidnæ, <lb/>
            Fighting for fair-haired Helen." <lb/>
            But it is not likely that if Theseus had been there, his <lb/>
            mother and the town of Aphidnæ would have been taken.</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="33">
<p>After the fall of Aphidnæ, the people of Athens <lb/>
            became terrified, and were persuaded by Mnestheus to admit <lb/>
            the sons of Tyndareus to the city, and to treat them as friends, <lb/>
            because, he said, they were only at war with Theseus, who <lb/>
            had been the first to use violence, and were the saviours <lb/>
            and benefactors of the rest of mankind. These words of <lb/>
            his were confirmed by their behaviour, for, victorious as <lb/>
            they were, they yet demanded nothing except initiation <lb/>
            into the mysteries, as they were, no less than Herakles, <lb/>
            connected with the city. This was permitted them, and <lb/>
            they were adopted by Aphidnus, as Herakles had been by <lb/>
            Pylius. They received divine honours, being addressed as <lb/>
            " Anakes," either because of the cessation of the war, or <lb/>
            from the care they took, when they had such a large army <lb/>
            within the walls of Athens, that no one should be wronged ; <lb/>
            for those who take care of or guard anything are said to <lb/>
            do it " anakos," and perhaps for this reason kings are called <lb/>
            “ Anaktes." Some say that they were called Anakas <lb/>
            because of the appearance of their stars in the heavens <lb/>
            above, for the Attics called " above " “ anekas."</p>

<p>It is said that Æthra, the mother of Theseus, <lb/>
            was carried off as a captive to Lacedæmon, and thence to <lb/>
            Troy with Helen, and Homer supports this view, when he <lb/>
            says that there followed Helen, <lb/>
            " Aithra the daughter of Pittheus and large-eyed Klymene." <lb/>
            Others reject this verse, and the legend about Mounychus, <lb/>

<p>Now Aidoneus the Molossian king chanced to <lb/>
            be entertaining Herakles, and related to him the story of <lb/>
            Theseus and Peirithous, what they had intended to do, <lb/>
            and how they had been caught in the act and punished. <lb/>
            Herakles was much grieved at hearing how one had <lb/>
            perished ingloriously, and the other was like to perish. <lb/>
            He thought that nothing would be gained by reproaching <lb/>
            the king for his conduct to Peirithous, but he begged for <lb/>
            the life of Theseus, and pointed out that the release of his <lb/>
            friend was a favour which he deserved. Aidoneus agreed, <lb/>
            and Theseus, when set free, returned to Athens, where he <lb/>
            found that his party was not yet overpowered. Whatever <lb/>
            consecrated grounds had been set apart for him by the city, <lb/>
            he dedicated to Herakles, and called Heraklea instead of <lb/>
            Thesea, except four, according to Philochorus. But, as he <lb/>
            at once wished to preside and manage the state as before, <lb/>
            he was met by factious opposition, for he found that those <lb/>
            who had been his enemies before, had now learned not to <lb/>
            fear him, while the common people had become corrupted, <lb/>
            and now required to be specially flattered instead of doing <lb/>
            their duty in silence.</p>
          <p>He endeavoured to establish his government by force, <lb/>
            but was overpowered by faction; and at last, despairing <lb/>
            of success, he secretly sent his children to Eubœa, to <lb/>
            Elephenor, the son of Chalkodous; and he himself, after <lb/>
            solemnly uttering curses on the Athenians at Gargettus,' <lb/>
            where now is the place called Araterion, or the place of <lb/>
            curses, set sail for Skyros, where he was, he imagined, on <lb/>
            friendly terms with the inhabitants, and possessed a <lb/>
            paternal estate in the island. At that time Lykomedes <lb/>
            was king of Skyros; so he proceeded to demand from him <lb/>
            his lands, in order to live there, though some say that he <lb/>
            asked him to assist him against the Athenians. Lyko­ <lb/>
            medes, either in fear of the great reputation of Theseus, <lb/>
            or else to gain the favour of Mnestheus, led him up to <lb/>
            the highest mountain top in the country, on the pretext <lb/>
             <pb n="28"/>
            of showing him his estate from thence, and pushed him <lb/>
            over a precipice. Some say that he stumbled and fell <lb/>
            of himself, as he was walking after supper, according <lb/>
            to his custom. As soon as he was dead, no one thought <lb/>
            any more of him, but Mnestheus reigned over the <lb/>
            Athenians, while Theseus's children were brought up as <lb/>
            private citizens by Elephenor, and followed him to <lb/>
            Ilium. When Mnestheus died at Ilium, they returned <lb/>
            home and resumed their rightful sovereignty. In sub­ <lb/>
            sequent times, among many other things which led the <lb/>
            Athenians to honour Theseus as a hero or demi-god, most <lb/>
            remarkable was his appearance at the battle of Marathon, <lb/>
            where his spirit was seen by many, clad in armour, lead­ <lb/>
            ing the charge against the barbarians.</p>

<p>After the Persian war, in the archonship of <lb/>
            Phædo, the Athenians were told by the Delphian Oracle <lb/>
            to take home the bones of Theseus and keep them with <lb/>
            the greatest care and honour. There was great difficulty <lb/>
            in obtaining them and in discovering his tomb, on account <lb/>
            of the wild and savage habits of the natives of the island. <lb/>
            However, Kimon took the island, as is written in my <lb/>
            history of his Life, and making it a point of honour to dis­ <lb/>
            cover his tomb, he chanced to behold an eagle pecking <lb/>
            with its beak and scratching with its talons at a small <lb/>
            rising ground. Here he dug, imagining that the spot had <lb/>
            been pointed out by a miracle. There was found the coffin <lb/>
            of a man of great stature, and lying beside it a brazen <lb/>
            lance-head and a sword. These relics were brought to <lb/>
            Athens by Kimon, on board of his trireme, and the de­ <lb/>
            lighted Athenians received them with splendid processions <lb/>
            and sacrifices, just as if the hero himself were come to the <lb/>
            city. He is buried in the midst of the city, near where <lb/>
            the Gymnasium now stands, and his tomb is a place of <lb/>
            sanctuary for slaves, and all that are poor and oppressed, <lb/>
            because Theseus, during his life, was the champion and <lb/>
            avenger of the poor, and always kindly hearkened to their <lb/>
            prayers. Their greatest sacrifice in his honour takes <lb/>
            place on the eighth of the month of Pyanepsion, upon <lb/>
            which day he and the youths came back from Crete. But <lb/>
            besides this they hold a service in his honour on the eighth <lb/>
            of all the other months, either because it was on the <lb/>
             <pb n="29"/>
            eighth day of Hekatombeion that he first arrived in Athens <lb/>
            from Troezen, as is related by Diodorus the topographer, <lb/>
            or else thinking that number to be especially his own, <lb/>
            because he is said to have been the son of Poseidon, and <lb/>
            Poseidon is honoured on the eighth day of every month. <lb/>
            For the number eight is the first cube of an even number, <lb/>
            and is double the first square, and therefore peculiarly <lb/>
            represents the immovable abiding power of that god whom <lb/>
            we address as " the steadfast," and the “ earth upholder.”</p>
