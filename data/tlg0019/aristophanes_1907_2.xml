          <p>WE have heard, in the Introduction to the Ecclesiazusae, of the position <lb/>
            to which Athens was reduced by the disastrous termination of the <lb/>
            Peloponnesian War; of the bold step which she took, after nine years <lb/>
            of humiliation, to regain her independence by entering into the anti- <lb/>
            Spartan League; and finally of the marvellous revival of her fortunes under <lb/>
            the auspices of Conon. That able officer arrived at Athens in the year <lb/>
            B. c. 393, after a prolonged sojourn, in conjunction with the Persian <lb/>
            satrap Pharnabazus, at the Isthmus of Corinth. There the army of the <lb/>
            League was stationed; and there Conon was in constant communication <lb/>
            with the leaders of the League. One important result of their conferences <lb/>
            was the establishment by Conon of a Foreign Legion, <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸξενικὸν</foreign>, a force <lb/>
            of foreign mercenaries in connexion with the allied army at Corinth, but <lb/>
            always under the immediate command of an Athenian general. The <lb/>
            troops which composed the Legion seem to have been levied in Asia, and <lb/>
            to have accompanied Pharnabazus and Conon in their adventurous voyage <lb/>
            through the Aegaean to ravage the Laconian sea-board 1. Conon himself <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἅματῷ ἔαρι ναῦς τε πολλὰςσυμπληρώ, καὶ ξενικὸν ,προσμισθωσνοοος,ἔπλευσεν <lb/>

            τὴν Λακεδαίμονα</foreign>.-Xen. Hell. iv. 8. 7. Xenophon does not identify this <foreign xml:lang="grc">ξενικὸν</foreign> <lb/>
            with, indeed he says nothing about the establishment of, ro <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐν Κορίνθῳ ξενικὸν</foreign>, but <lb/>
            their identity cannot be doubted. Here was a body of mercenaries ready to <lb/>
            Conon's hand, and he can hardly have collected others during his stay at Corinth. <lb/>
            It is this Foreign Legion to which Aristophanes is referring when he asks in line <lb/>
            173 of the present Comedy, TO <foreign xml:lang="grc">δ</foreign>’ <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐν Κορίνθῳξενικὸν οὐχ οὗτος</foreign>(Wealth) <foreign xml:lang="grc">τρέΦει</foreign> ; and <lb/>
            to which Demosthenes in his First Philippic (27) refers in language borrowed from <lb/>
            the line just quoted, <foreign xml:lang="grc">καὶ πρότερόν</foreign>1TOTIIKOVC<foreign xml:lang="grc">Οξενικὸν τρέΦειν ἐνΚορίνθῳ τἡ πόλιν</foreign>, ov <lb/>

            was no doubt their commander during the operations of the fleet; but his <lb/>
            connexion with them must have terminated when they were disembarked <lb/>
            and affiliated to the army at Corinth, or at all events so soon as a new <lb/>
            Athenian general could be appointed in his place. His successors in the <lb/>
            command, however, were men of remarkable ability ; and under the skilful <lb/>
            generalship of Iphicrates the Legion distinguished itself in the following <lb/>
            year by destroying a Spartan <foreign xml:lang="grc">μ</foreign>ó<foreign xml:lang="grc">ρα</foreign>.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile the reconstruction of the Athenian navy was also proceeding <lb/>
            apace. During the nine years of subordination to Sparta it was limited <lb/>
            to twelve triremes, but already before the date of the Plutus (not five <lb/>
            years after the intervention of Conon) it was again becoming a formidable <lb/>
            and ubiquitous power. We find Thrasybulus leading forty ships to the <lb/>
            Hellespont (immediately after a squadron of ten had been destroyed by <lb/>
            Teleutias); whilst eight more were subsequently sent under Iphicrates to <lb/>
            the same destination; Eunomus led thirteen to Aegina; and a squadron <lb/>
            was stationed off the coast of Acarnania, of sufficient magnitude to <lb/>
            prevent any attempt on the part of Agesilaus to return from Calydon <lb/>
            to the Peloponnese by the open sea 1. Athens was rapidly regaining the <lb/>
            position, not indeed of an Imperial City, but of a first-class and <lb/>
            conspicuous Hellenic State.</p>
          <p>Doubtless a start in this resuscitation of her power was made with the <lb/>
            Persian gold which Conon had brought to Athens. But the Athenians <lb/>
            themselves, unassisted as they now were by the tribute of their allies, <lb/>
            must have made very great sacrifices to complete and sustain the work. <lb/>
            The question of Aristophanes Does it not require Wealth to man the <lb/>
            triremes, and maintain the Foreign Legion at Corinth ? must have found an <lb/>
            echo in many an Athenian heart. And very welcome to the whole <figure type="illustration">

              chief purposes for which the 500 talents, mentioned in Eccl. 824, were required. <lb/>
              See the Commentary on that passage. </note> <lb/>
               <pb n="vii"/>
              audience must have been the restoration of Wealth, at the close of the <lb/>
              Comedy, to his long-deserted home in the Athenian Treasury.</p>
          <p>Such was the position of Athens when the play before us was exhibited. <lb/>
            Aristophanes had indeed twenty years before1 (B. c. 408, in the archon­ <lb/>
            ship of Diocles) produced a Comedy bearing the name of the <foreign xml:lang="grc">Πλοῦτος</foreign>, but <lb/>
            there is no reason for believing that it resembled in the slightest degree <lb/>
            the Comedy which has come down to ourselves. We may be sure that it <lb/>
            was a political or literary satire, adorned with a Parabasis, and enlivened <lb/>
            with a liberal supply of Choral melodies. It appeared midway between <lb/>
            the Lysistrata and the Frogs, in what may be termed the specially lyrical <lb/>
            period of the poet's career, a period extending from the Peace to the <lb/>
            Frogs. And it is inconceivable that he should at that date have written <lb/>
            a Comedy bearing any resemblance to the present in tone or character. <lb/>
            Only one short passage of the First Plutus remains. It is quoted by the <lb/>
            Scholiast on Frogs 1093 as <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐν Πλούτῳ πρώτῳ</foreign>, and runs as follows- <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BELL_09_fig2.jpg"/></figure> <lb/>
              See the Commentary on that line of the Frogs. The other notices which <lb/>
              the Fragment Collectors attribute to the First Plutus consist of seven <lb/>
              expressions (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀναπηρίαν,βλὰξ, γραίζειν, ἐμπαίζειν, ζυγοποιεῖν, ἦν</foreign> 8' <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐγὼ</foreign>, and <lb/>
              <foreign xml:lang="grc">ῥνφῆσαι</foreign> which the grammarians ascribe to '<foreign xml:lang="grc">Αριστοφάνης Πλούτῳ</foreign>, and <lb/>
              which are not found in the existing play.</p>
          <p>We may therefore leave the First Plutus out of our consideration as <lb/>
            having in all probability an entirely different plot carried out in an <lb/>
            entirely different manner; merely remarking that in two plays on the <lb/>
            same subject, however independent of each other, it is more than probable <note type="footnote"> 1 Scholiast on lines 173, 179. Both these Scholia are quoted a little further on. <lb/>
            There is no ground for Professor Van Leeuwen's scepticism about the Plutus of <lb/>
            B. c. 408. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Such, I think, is the proper arrangement of the words. It is the ordinary <lb/>
            ending of a series of iambic dimeters, occurring six times in Acharnians 930-51. <lb/>
            So in Knights 379-81 and 454-6. In Peace 866, 867 and 920, 921, the dipody <lb/>
            precedes the dimeter. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="viii"/>
            that there will occur, here and there, some slight points of contact. See <lb/>
            the Commentary on Eccl. 926.</p>
          <p>The present Comedy was exhibited in the spring of B, c. 388, during <lb/>
            the archonship of Antipater. We do not know whether it was produced <lb/>
            at the Great, or at the Lenaean, Dionysia, or with what success : but we <lb/>
            know that there were now five competitors instead of three, which had <lb/>
            been the limit during the Peloponnesian War. For with the deaths of <lb/>
            Euripides and Sophocles, the great stream of Tragic song which had <lb/>
            rolled on with undiminished vigour for nearly a century became well-nigh <lb/>
            dried up ; there were still plenty of poetasters attempting to write Tragic <lb/>
            plays (<foreign xml:lang="grc">μειρακύκλλια τραγῳδιας ποιοῦντα</foreign>, Frogs 89), but there was no real <lb/>
            successor to the great Triumvirate : and it was found necessary to repro­ <lb/>
            duce on the stage again and again the dramas of the three dead Masters. <lb/>
            But Comedy, though changing its character, grew more and more ; and <lb/>
            as if to compensate for the dwindling interest of Tragedy, there were now <lb/>
            five Comedies instead of three to compete for the prize at the Dionysian <lb/>
            festivals 1. The four poets who competed with Aristophanes on this <lb/>
            occasion were Nicochares with the " Laconians,”Aristomenes with the <lb/>
            "Admetus," Nicophon with the “Adonis,” and Alcaeus with the <lb/>
            " Pasiphae." A few unimportant words from the “ Laconians ” and the <lb/>
            " Pasiphae " have come down to our times : but the “Admetus ”and the <lb/>
            “Adonis " are not elsewhere mentioned.</p>
          <p>This was the last play which Aristophanes produced in his own name : <lb/>
            but there seems every reason to believe that he afterwards revised it and <lb/>
            exhibited the revised edition in the name of his son Araros, For the <lb/>
            author of the Greek Life of Aristophanes tells us 2, in the most explicit <note type="footnote">1 See Aristotle's Polity of Athens, chap. 56; Hesychius, s.v. <foreign xml:lang="grc">μισθός</foreign>; Boeckh, <lb/>
            Corpus Ins. Graec. i. p. 353, Inscription 231, and Boeckh's note on Inscription 229. <lb/>
            And see the note on Frogs 367. Had the Polity of Athens been discovered in <lb/>
            Fritzsche's time, he could never have advanced the extraordinary notion that of <lb/>
            the four poets who are stated in the didascalia to have competed with the Plutus, <lb/>
            two competed with the First, and two with the Second, Plutus. De Socrate Yet. <lb/>
            Corn. Dissertatio. Quaest. Aristoph. i. 187 note, </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Speaking of the Plutus, the writer says <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐν τούτῳ τῷ, δράματι συνέστησησε τῷ πλήθει</foreign> </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="ix"/>
            terms, that he brought out the Plutus in the name of Araros, for the <lb/>
            purpose of commending him to the Athenian People (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐν τούτῷ</foreign> TW <foreign xml:lang="grc">δράματι <lb/>
            συνέστησε τῷ πλήθει τὸν υἱὸν 'Αραρότα</foreign>). And though the passage in the <lb/>
            Third Argument 1 relating to Araros yields no sense as it stands, it is by <lb/>
            no means improbable that it was intended to convey precisely the same <lb/>
            information in very similar words, and to mean-</p>
          <p>And this being the last Comedy Aristophanes produced in his own name, and <lb/>
            wishing by its means to commend his son Araros to the audience (<foreign xml:lang="grc">καὶ</foreign> TOP <foreign xml:lang="grc">νἱὸν <lb/>
            αὑτοῦ συστῆσαι</foreign> ’<foreign xml:lang="grc">Αραρότὸταδἰ αὐτῆς τοῖς θεαταῖς βουλόμε νος</foreign>) he brought it out again, <lb/>
            as well as the two remaining Comedies, the Cocalus and the Aeolosicon, in his <lb/>
            son's name.</p>
          <p>Of course we are not to suppose that there was a Third Plutus; there <lb/>
            was merely a double representation of the Second, just as there was <lb/>
            a double representation of the Frogs and of the Aeolosicon, and a double <lb/>
            edition of the Clouds. The play introduced by Araros would be sub­ <lb/>
            stantially the play introduced by Aristophanes, but would be revised and <lb/>
            touched up here and there, where the taste of the poet himself or perhaps <lb/>
            the criticisms of others suggested a slight alteration.</p>
          <p>And this theory may serve to explain a difficulty which has long <lb/>
            perplexed commentators and critics; the difficulty arising from the fact <lb/>
            that the Scholiasts on the extant Comedy suppose themselves to be <lb/>
            commenting on the First Plutus, the play of 408. For in my opinion <lb/>
            the Scholiasts had before them two Plutus-plays; the extant Comedy, <lb/>
            and the revised edition brought out in the name of Araros; and as they <figure type="illustration">

              words <foreign xml:lang="grc">δἱ αὐτῆς</foreign>, a remedy which, if the passage stood alone, would be probable <lb/>
              enough. Others suppose that some words, relating to a second representation of <lb/>
              the Plutus in the name of Araros have dropped out. And the insertion of words <lb/>
              to that effect brings the passage into complete harmony with the statements in <lb/>
              the Greek Life. The observation in both narratives about commending Amaros to <lb/>
              the public seems to show either that one writer was borrowing from the other, or <lb/>
              that both obtained their information from the same source. </note> <lb/>

              knew only of a First and a Second Plutus (the plays of 408 and 388), <lb/>
              they fell into the natural error of supposing the earlier of their two plays <lb/>
              -the extant Comedy-to be the First Plutus, the play of 408; and the <lb/>
              revised edition to be the Second Plutus, the play of 388. It may be <lb/>
              desirable to refer in more detail to the scholia 1 which give rise to the <lb/>
              question.</p>
          <p>Thus, on line 115, where Chremylus tells Wealth that he trusts <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ταήτἡςἀπαλλάξειν σε τῆς ὀΦθαλμας</foreign>,the Scholiast observes 2 that <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὀφθαλμία</foreign> <lb/>
            which properly signifies a mere disease of the eye is here used, in <lb/>
            a peculiar sense, for blindness j and that therefore in the Second Plutus, <lb/>

              line in both editions could not of itself prove that it did not originally exist in <lb/>

              the Scholiast's " Second Plutus to was the play of 408. I have no doubt that the <lb/>
              Scholiast found the line both in the extant Comedy and in the revised edition: <lb/>

              [Now Glaucippus was the archon before Diocles.] (5) And finally on line <lb/>
              1146 where the reference is to the capture of Phyle by Thrasybulus, the <lb/>
              Scholiast says 1 that this had not happened at the date of the play; it <lb/>
              did not happen till five years later. [It occurred in the archonship of <lb/>
              Pythodorus, 404-403.] And he therefore supposes that this line also <lb/>
              must have been transferred from the Second to the First Plutus,</p>
          <p>It is plain therefore that the Scholiasts supposed the play on which <lb/>
            they were commenting to be the First Plutus (the play of 408) ; and <lb/>
            that they had before them a later Plutus which they supposed to be the <lb/>
            play of 388. But in truth the play on which they were commenting <lb/>
            was the extant Comedy, the play of 388, and their later Plutus was the <lb/>
            revised edition brought out in the name of Araros.</p>
          <p>The mistake of the Scholiasts was, I suppose, responsible for the strange <lb/>
            theory put forward 2 by Kuster and Brunck, viz. that the Comedy which <lb/>
            has come down to us is neither the First Plutus nor the Second Plutus, <lb/>
            but an amalgam of both. The first editor who attempted to arrange the <lb/>
            eleven surviving Comedies in their chronological order was Bekker, and <lb/>
            he in his edition placed the Plutus immediately before the Frogs. But <lb/>
            whilst Bekker's work was passing through the press, a dissertation was <lb/>
            published by Francis Hitter, in which he went carefully through the <lb/>
            various notes of time contained in the extant Comedy, and pointed out, <lb/>
            as the fact is, that alleits historical allusions are to events which occurred <lb/>
            subsequently not only to the archonship of Diodes, but even to the Fall <lb/>
            of Athens. And his conclusion that we have before us, in accordance <figure type="illustration">

              with the didascalia, the Comedy as originally exhibited in the year 388 <lb/>
              is now universally accepted. His dissertation was published at Bonn in <lb/>
              the year 1828, and is prefixed in a condensed form to Dindorfs notes on <lb/>
              the Plutus. But Ritter further expressed an opinion that the Comedy <lb/>
              which the Scholiasts designate as the later of their two Plutus-plays, <lb/>
              was none other than the First Plutus, the play of 408. He can hardly <lb/>
              have taken into account the vast difference between a Lyrical Comedy of <lb/>
              the earlier date, and our existing Plutus. It is inconceivable that, with <lb/>
              these two plays before them, they could have supposed the extant Plutus <lb/>
              to have been produced twenty years before the Lyrical Comedy. And <lb/>
              I believe that the true solution will be found in the foregoing pages.</p>
          <p>The Ecclesiazusae and the Plutus arc the only extant Comedies which <lb/>
            were produced after the downfall of the Athenian Empire. There was an <lb/>
            interval of twelve years between the Frogs and the Ecclesiazusae, but only <lb/>
            five years intervened between the latter play and the Plutus. And it is <lb/>
            not merely a question of time. Between the date of the Frogs and the date <lb/>
            of the Ecclesiazusae the whole face of the Attic world had been changed ; <lb/>
            the political forces, the hopes and fears, which were in operation at the date <lb/>
            of the earlier Comedy had passed away for ever; old enemies had become <lb/>
            new friends ; and new ambitions and new ideas had sprung up on every side. <lb/>
            But nothing of similar importance had occurred between the date of the <lb/>
            Ecclesiazusae and the date of the Plutus; the two plays run in the same <lb/>
            groove ; and bear numerous traces of having been composed under the <lb/>
            same circumstances and during the same period. I lay no stress on the <lb/>
            fact, which some have pointed out, that a few simple words are found in <lb/>
            both these Comedies, and nowhere else in Aristophanes; for there are no <lb/>
            two plays, however widely separated in point of time, in which some <lb/>
            coincidences of this kind may not be discovered ; it is far more important <lb/>
            to observe that the same topics and the same historical surroundings <lb/>
            which were most prominent in the poet's mind when he wrote the <lb/>
            Ecelesiazusae still held a place there when he wrote the Plutus. Agyrrhius <lb/>
            and the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐκκλησιατικὸν</foreign>, the dole for attendance at the Public Assembly <lb/>
            which Agyrrhius was the first to introduce, and which he finally raised <lb/>
             <pb n="xiv"/>
            to three obols,—the increased attendance at the Assemblies consequent <lb/>
            on that increase of pay,—Neocleides, one of the regular speakers in the <lb/>
            Assembly, his blindness and how to cure it,—Thrasybulus and the <lb/>
            unfortunate change in the public sentiment towards that distinguished <lb/>
            citizen-the proceedings of the anti-Spartan League at Corinth—the <lb/>
            practice of evading military service by pretending to be an <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἔμπορος</foreign>,—the <lb/>
            degradation of Aristyllus—the misery of dying without leaving enough <lb/>
            for one's funeral-these are some of the topics which were present to the <lb/>
            poet's mind as well when he was writing the Plutus as when he was <lb/>
            writing the Ecclesiazusae. And this indeed would be an additional <lb/>
            proof, if any further proof were required, that our Comedy is the Plutus <lb/>
            which was produced in 388.</p>
          <p>And everywhere in the play before us we find tokens of the change <lb/>
            which is passing over Athenian Comedy. The stately Parabasis is gone; <lb/>
            the beautiful lyrics which elevated the whole performance into a higher <lb/>
            and purer atmosphere have altogether disappeared; the great historical <lb/>
            personages, literary and political, the poets, the philosophers, the dema­ <lb/>
            gogues, the generals, who moved through the earlier scenes of the <lb/>
            Aristophanic drama, have faded not only from his own satire, but almost <lb/>
            from the very recollection of his audience : we are no longer amidst the <lb/>
            pomp and glory, the boundless activities of Imperial Athens with her <lb/>
            Imperial instincts and her splendid ambitions; comedy has become social <lb/>
            instead of political; the performers might almost be treading, so to say, <lb/>
            the boards of some provincial theatre. But I am not one of those who <lb/>
            can trace some decay in the wit and vigour of the poet himself. If we <lb/>
            can imagine one of his earlier plays denuded of all these accessories, I do <lb/>
            not think that the Plutus would compare unfavourably with what would <lb/>
            remain. Take for instance the scene with the Informer in the Birds <lb/>
            and the scene with the Informer in the Plutus. It seems to me that <lb/>
            the latter is far the wittier, the more vigorous, and the more dramatic <lb/>
            of the two. The material and surroundings of Comedy have changed; <lb/>
            the comic force of the poet remains unchanged.</p>
          <p>The idea on which the Comedy turns is one which in the ancient world <lb/>
             <pb n="xv"/>
            was frequently perplexing the wisest minds. How is it that the ungodly <lb/>
            are often seen in great prosperity while the righteous are needy and poor? <lb/>
            This question the Comic poet answers with a Comic jest. It must be <lb/>
            because Wealth is blind (as the poets commonly feign him), and therefore <lb/>
            unable to distinguish between the wicked and the good. Let his sight <lb/>
            be restored and all will be well: he will visit the righteous, and keep far <lb/>
            off from the ungodly. No sooner said than done. Wealth is taken to <lb/>
            spend the night in the Temple of Asclepius, and " when the day dawned " <lb/>
            (to use the formula found in the Asclepian inscriptions) " he went away <lb/>
            cured.” At once the tables are turned : the positions are reversed; the <lb/>
            righteous become wealthy, and the wicked are ruined. There is yet a <lb/>
            second stage, which now and then unexpectedly makes itself felt, in this <lb/>
            revolution. When Wealth has deserted the wicked, and gone over to the <lb/>
            righteous, the former will find it to their interest to become righteous too, <lb/>
            so that finally all men will become both righteous and wealthy, and <lb/>
            Poverty will cease out of the land. This second result is only brought <lb/>
            forward occasionally; notably in the discussion with Poverty herself, and <lb/>
            in the complaint of the Priest at the conclusion of the play.</p>
          <p>Throughout the Comedy there is a continual interchange between the <lb/>
            two significations of the word <foreign xml:lang="grc">πλου̃τος</foreign>, viz. Wealth and the God of Wealth; <lb/>
            and if in the translation the God were called Plutus, this ever-recurring <lb/>
            humour would be entirely lost. Retaining therefore for the play itself <lb/>
            the title of the “ Plutus " I have in the translation everywhere called the <lb/>
            God by the name of Wealth; a proceeding which might be considered in <lb/>
            questionable taste, if it were not in reality a matter of necessity.</p>
          <p>Wealth, we have seen, recovered his eyesight by the simple expedient <lb/>
            of passing a night in the Temple of Asclepius; and Aristophanes takes <lb/>
            the opportunity of putting into the mouth of the slave a very vivid and <lb/>
            graphic, if a somewhat farcical, account of the proceedings which took <lb/>
            place in one of those famous health-resorts. We have no means of <lb/>
            ascertaining which is the particular Temple in which the cure is supposed <lb/>
            to have been effected. Philocleon, in the Wasps, was ferried across to <lb/>
            Aegina; and though there seems to have been now, even if there was not <lb/>
             <pb n="xvi"/>
            then, a Temple of Asclepius in Athens, and indeed another in the Peiraeus, <lb/>
            yet they do not appear to have become noted as health-resorts, and it <lb/>
            seems to me most probable that Wealth too is supposed to have been <lb/>
            taken to Aegina. However others are of a different opinion; and the <lb/>
            question is not very material; for doubtless the same course was pursued <lb/>
            in all these health-resorts. It may not be out of place here to say a few <lb/>
            words on the subject of Asclepius and his cures.</p>
          <p>Epidaurns was, in historic times, the head-quarters and metropolis of <lb/>
            the Asclepian worship; but the original home of that worship appears to <lb/>
            have been at Tricca, in north-west Thessaly. There according to Strabo <lb/>
            was the oldest Temple of Asclepius; and it was from Tricca1 that “ his <lb/>
            two sons, the kindly physicians, Podaleirius and Machaon” led out their <lb/>
            troops to take part in the expedition against Troy. And although the <lb/>
            Epidaurians contended that Asclepius, the son of Apollo and Coronis, was <lb/>
            born within their boundaries, and their contention was upheld by Apollo <lb/>
            himself in a response from his oracular shrine at Delphi2, yet even so the <lb/>
            priority of the Thessalian claim was recognized by the admission that <lb/>
            Coronis was the daughter of Phlegyas, the Thessalian king, and was <lb/>
            merely on a temporary visit with her father to Epidaurus when she gave <lb/>
            birth to the child. However in the end Epidaurus overshadowed and <lb/>
            superseded Tricca; it was only in Epidaurus that the yellow snakes3, <note type="footnote"> 1 Strabo ix. 5. 17 (see Id. xiv. 1. 39). Homer, Iliad ii. 731— </note> <figure type="illustration">

              Asclepius. So again, a century later, when the Romans, after a three- <lb/>

            and a half miles (five Roman miles 3) inland from the town, at the north- <lb/>
            eastern end of a valley which is there inclosed by a semicircle of steep <lb/>
            and wooded hills 4. It lies, as it were, in a recess at the extremity of this <lb/>
            valley, partly surrounded by the hills, and separated from the rest of the <lb/>
            valley by a wall the remains of which are still visible. The traveller <note type="footnote"> <foreign xml:lang="grc">γη̃</foreign>.—Pausanias, Corinthiaca, chap. xxviii. ad init. "The yellow snakes which were <lb/>

              south-eastern extremity.</p>
          <p>The sanctuary is something less than a mile in circumference, <lb/>
            comprising therefore, presumably, nearly forty acres. This space <lb/>
            contained a variety of buildings; the Temple of Asclepius himself, with <lb/>
            his statue in ivory and gold; beyond the Temple 1 (that is, I suppose, <lb/>
            adjoining it on the side nearest the hills) the great dormitory in which <lb/>
            the patients slept; a Rotunda of white marble, which Pausanias calls the <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">Θόλος</foreign> ; shrines of Artemis, Aphrodite, and Themis; a stadium; a theatre <lb/>
            constructed by Polycleitus, and in the opinion of Pausanias superior <lb/>
            to all others in its charm and the beauty of its proportions; for who, <lb/>
            says he, can in these matters vie with Polycleitus ? and many other <lb/>
            erections.</p>
          <p>Pausanias2 tells us that within the enclosure were certain pillars <lb/>
            (of which only six were standing in his time but formerly their number <lb/>
            was greater) whereon were inscribed the names of men and women <lb/>
            cured by Asclepius, and from what diseases they suffered, and in what <lb/>
            manner they were cured. And he adds that these inscriptions were <lb/>
            written in the Doric tongue. And in another place he calls them " the <lb/>
            Cures of Asclepius," <foreign xml:lang="grc">του̑</foreign> ’<foreign xml:lang="grc">Ασκληπιου̑</foreign> ra <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἰάματα</foreign>. These pillars were <lb/>
            apparently in the open air; but within the building itself were tablets, <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">πίνακες</foreign>, containing lists of these Cures. " Epidaurus,” says Strabo 3, “ is <lb/>
            a city by no means undistinguished; chiefly on account of the mani­ <figure type="illustration">

              festation of Asclepius there, who is believed to cure all manner of diseases, <lb/>
              and whose sanctuary is always full of sick people, and of votive tablets <lb/>
              recording the cures; as is also the case at Cos and Tricca." Epidaurus1, <lb/>
              Cos, and Tricca seem to have been the most notable of these Asclepian <lb/>
              health-resorts in the ancient world.</p>
          <p>The accuracy of Pausanias and Strabo has been abundantly vindicated <lb/>
            by the investigations of M. Kabbadias and his companions amongst the <lb/>
            ruins of the Epidaurian sanctuary. Amongst other discoveries they <lb/>
            found an inscription which is entitled ’<foreign xml:lang="grc">άματα του̑</foreign> ’<foreign xml:lang="grc">Απόλλωνος καὶ</foreign> <lb/>
            ’<foreign xml:lang="grc">Ασκληπιου̑</foreign> and contains a record of some twenty cures effected on <lb/>
            suppliants sleeping in the dormitory there. The inscription is set out in <lb/>

            in the sanctuary described in the present play,- <figure type="illustration">

              Ambrosia of Athens, blind in one eye. She came as a suppliant to the God, but <lb/>
              walking round in the sanctuary, she scoffed at some of the cures as incredible <lb/>
              and impossible, that the halt and the blind should be made whole, by merely <lb/>
              seeing a vision in their sleep. But she in her sleep saw a vision. It seemed that <lb/>
              the God stood over her and announced that he would cure her of her disease; but <lb/>
              that by way of payment she would have to present to the sanctuary a pig made of <lb/>
              silver as a memento of her ignorance. And when he had thus said he cut open <lb/>
              her diseased eye and poured in a healing drug. And when the day dawned she <lb/>
              went away cured. <note type="footnote"> 1 And hence they are joined by Herodas in his invocation of Asclepius at the <lb/>

          <p>A man came as a suppliant to the God, blind in one eye in such wise that <lb/>
            he had only the lids and nothing within them, but the socket was quite empty. <lb/>
            Then some of the folk in the Temple exclaimed at his folly, imagining that he <lb/>
            could recover his sight, when he had not even the slightest commencement of an <lb/>
            eye, but only an empty space. But as he slept, there appeared to him a vision. <lb/>
            It seemed that the God prepared some drug, and then drawing the eyelids apart <lb/>
            poured it in. And when the day dawned, he went away, seeing with both eyes.</p><figure type="illustration">

          <p>A man's toe was healed by a serpent. This man, suffering grievously in his toe <lb/>
            from a malignant ulcer, was brought forth while it was yet day by the attendants, <lb/>
            and took his seat on a bench. And when he had fallen asleep, a serpent issued <lb/>
            out of the Temple, and licked his toe and healed it; and when it had done this, <lb/>
            it went back into the Temple. And when he awoke, healed, he said that he had <lb/>
            seen a vision; it seemed as though a youth of comely appearance laid upon his <lb/>
            toe a healing drug.</p>
          <p>In this last case, the <foreign xml:lang="grc">δράκων</foreign> came out of the Temple into the adjoining <lb/>
            dormitory, licked the part diseased, and then retired again into the <lb/>
            Temple, exactly as the <foreign xml:lang="grc">δύο δράκοντε</foreign> in the Comedy did in the case of <lb/>
            Wealth. And it seems to me that the archaeologists must be wrong <lb/>
            who suppose that the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἄβατον</foreign> was the regular dormitory; its very name <lb/>
            implies the contrary; nor would the serpents be kept in the dormitory; <lb/>
            nor would they have come out of the dormitory to heal the sleeping <lb/>
            patient and afterwards returned to it again. The dormitory was the <lb/>
            large colonnade or area which adjoined the Temple; and which at <lb/>
            Epidaurus was 246 feet long by 31 wide; and at Cos 330 by 210. <lb/>
            Doubtless in the summer months this <foreign xml:lang="grc">στοὰ</foreign> was crowded with patients; <lb/>
            and although it is possible that some sufferers were allowed to sleep in <note type="footnote"> 1 The word is spelt with a single <foreign xml:lang="grc">λ</foreign> in this place only. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="xxi"/>
            the Temple itself, <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸ ἄβατον</foreign>, yet we may be sure that this was done only <lb/>
            on some special occasions, such as in the great cold of winter (when too <lb/>
            there would be but few <foreign xml:lang="grc">ίκέται</foreign>), or in the case of very delicate patients.</p>
          <p>In investigating the sanctuary of Asclepius in Cos, there was discovered <lb/>
            in the Temple-floor 1 “ a large rectangular coffer or cist composed of great <lb/>
            slabs of marble, each a foot thick. The coffer was about 5 feet long, <lb/>
            4 feet in breadth, and 3 feet in depth. The massive block which <lb/>
            formed the lid was pierced in the centre by an aperture 6 inches in <lb/>
            diameter." This coffer, Dr. Caton conjectures, was the place in which <lb/>
            the sacred serpents were kept; and there seems every reason to believe <lb/>
            that his conjecture is accurate. The serpents would ordinarily emerge <lb/>
            through the aperture in the lid; but whenever it might be thought <lb/>
            necessary or convenient, the lid itself would be removed.</p>
          <p>Cos too is supposed to be the scene of the Fourth Mime of Herodas. <lb/>
            Two ladies are bringing a cock as an offering to Asclepius, partly in <lb/>
            gratitude for the present partial cure of some disease, and partly in hope <lb/>
            of a more complete cure hereafter. The day has not dawned and the <lb/>
            shrine is not yet open. They linger outside, saluting the statues of <lb/>
            Asclepius himself, of his father and mother (Apollo and Coronis), and of <lb/>
            the various members of his family (Hygieia, Panacea, Epio, Iaso, <lb/>
            Podaleirius, and Machaon) ; and considering in what position they shall <lb/>
            affix the tablet recording the cure. Presently the sacristan throws open <lb/>
            the Temple door, and they go in, admiring the paintings there, as they <lb/>
            had admired the statuary outside. They then make their offering to the <lb/>
            God, giving a leg of the cock to the sacristan, and pushing a <foreign xml:lang="grc">πέλανος</foreign> <lb/>
            into the hole where the serpent dwells, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐς τὴν τρώγλην του̑ δράκοντος</foreign> (the <lb/>
            serpent being a <foreign xml:lang="grc">τρωγλοδύτης</foreign>, Aristotle, H. A. ix. 2. 10). The <foreign xml:lang="grc">τρώγλη</foreign> <lb/>
            would doubtless be represented by the aperture in the lid of the coffer <lb/>
            described by Dr. Caton as mentioned above.</p>
          <p>This cult of Asclepius was perhaps the pleasantest part of the old <lb/>
            Hellenic religion; nor did its popularity fail until the final extinction of <note type="footnote"> 1 I quote from a report in the Times of March 6, 1906, of a lecture delivered by <lb/>

            Paganism. Still in the days of Constantine, men believed that at <lb/>
            these famous health-resorts the patients were healed by a vision of the <lb/>
            night, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπιφαινομένου νύκτωρ καὶ ἰωμένου</foreign> TOV <foreign xml:lang="grc">δαίμονος</foreign> 1. Julian frequently <lb/>

          <p>Lucian, who is everywhere treading in the footsteps of Aristophanes, <lb/>
            introduces Poverty and Wealth, <foreign xml:lang="grc">Πενία</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">Πλου̑τος</foreign>, as characters in his <lb/>
            dialogue “ Timon"; and makes Poverty insist, as she does in the <lb/>
            Comedy, on the superiority of her training to the training afforded by <lb/>
            Wealth.</p>
          <p>The Plutus was, I suppose, the first Aristophanic Comedy to become <lb/>
            familiar in an English form to English readers. Randolph's " Hey for <lb/>
            Honesty, Down with Knavery” is described on its title-page as "a <lb/>
            Pleasant Comedie. Translated out of Aristophanes his Plutus by Thomas <lb/>
            Randolph "; and is prefaced by a dialogue between Aristophanes and his <lb/>
            Translator. It is in some scenes a fairly close and very good translation, <lb/>
            mostly in prose, of the Greek original; though in other places the <lb/>
            translator loses touch with Aristophanes, and giving free rein to his <lb/>
            fancy, introduces a farrago of wild buffoonery which is quite alien to <lb/>
            the spirit of the Athenian drama. It concludes with the marriage of <lb/>
            Plutus and Miss Honesty. Randolph's play was first printed in 1651 <lb/>
            after the authors death. It was soon afterwards acted (probably in <lb/>
            1652, says Isaac Reed) before a brilliant audience; and it is interesting <lb/>
            to observe that the part of the youth (<foreign xml:lang="grc">Νεανίας</foreign>) was on that occasion <lb/>
            taken by Sir Christopher Wren3, then a B.A. of Wadham College <lb/>
            about twenty years of age.</p>
          <p>There have not been many translations of the Plutus into English <lb/>
            verse. I know of only three; one by Edmund F, J. Carrington in <lb/>
            1825; a second by Sir Daniel Sandford, published in Blackwood's <note type="footnote"> 1 Sozomen, H. E. ii. 5. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Julian, Orat. vii. See the lines of Alexis translated in the commentary on <lb/>

            Magazine, Vol. 38 (December, 1835); and a third by Leonard Hampson <lb/>
            Rudd, in 1867. There is a prose translation, more vigorous than refined, <lb/>
            by Henry Fielding the novelist and the Rev. William Young.</p>
          <p>The Plutus, as we have seen in the earlier part of this Introduction, is <lb/>
            not only the last extant Comedy of Aristophanes, it is also the last <lb/>
            Comedy which he exhibited in his own name; but it is not the last <lb/>
            Comedy which he wrote. He composed indeed two more, the Cocalus <lb/>
            and the Aeolosicon, but these he intrusted to his son Araros, seeking by <lb/>
            that means to introduce and commend him to the Athenian people; <lb/>
            a sign that the poet's popularity with his countrymen remained un­ <lb/>
            diminished to the end. There may possibly have been another reason for <lb/>
            his handing over these two Comedies to his son. For in them he was <lb/>
            making a new departure, and substituting a humorous delineation of <lb/>
            ordinary life and manners for the vigorous political, literary, and social <lb/>
            satire which had been the animating principle of his earlier dramas. The <lb/>
            change had been foreshadowed in the Plutus; but it was in these two <lb/>
            plays that the ancient critics detected the germ of the later Comedy, the <lb/>
            Aeolosicon representing the Middle, and the Cocalus the New, Comedy, <lb/>
            the Comedy of Menander and Philemon.</p>
          <p>“ It was Aristophanes," says1 the author of the Greek Life, " who first <lb/>
            exhibited the style of the New Comedy. He did this in the Cocalus, <lb/>
            whence Menander and Philemon took the cue for their dramatic work." <lb/>
            " In the Cocalus," says the same writer2, “ he introduced the dramatic <lb/>
            Seduction and Recognition, and all the other things which Menander <lb/>
            imitated." And it would seem from a statement of Clemens Alexandrinus 3 <lb/>
            (as corrected by Casaubon), that the Cocalus itself was parodied and. <figure type="illustration">

              satirized by Philemon in his Comedy of the ‛<foreign xml:lang="grc">Υποβολιμαι̑ς</foreign>, the Supposi­ <lb/>
              titious Son. And the Aeolosicon is described by Platonius (<foreign xml:lang="grc">περὶ διαφορα̑ς <lb/>
              κωμῳδιω̑ν</foreign>) as belonging to the type of the Middle Comedy.</p>
          <p>A few fragments of the Cocalus have reached us, but not enough to <lb/>
            enable us even to make a guess at the character and drift of the play. <lb/>
            The title is supposed to refer to the Sicilian prince1 of that name to <lb/>
            whom Daedalus fled from the vengeance of Minos, and who, when Minos <lb/>
            followed the fugitive to Sicily, contrived by treachery to destroy the <lb/>
            pursuer, either he or his daughters having let boiling water into the bath <lb/>
            where Minos was. This is perhaps the more probable, because Aristo­ <lb/>
            phanes had already written a Comedy bearing the name of Daedalus; but <lb/>
            of course it is altogether uncertain.</p>
          <p>Of the Aeolosicon we can form a somewhat better idea. Its title is <lb/>
            derived from two proper names, <foreign xml:lang="grc">Αἴολος</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">Σίκων. Σίκων</foreign> was a slaveys <lb/>
            name (Eccl. 867); and in a passage cited by Athenaeus (ix. 22) from <lb/>
            a comedy of Sosipater it is the name of a cook, the founder of a great <lb/>
            school of cookery. And it is a cook's name in this Aristophanic Comedy. <lb/>
            We see him receiving his mistress's orders (like the cook in the Menaech­ <lb/>
            mi) to provide what was required for a banquet; and presently returning <lb/>
            from his marketing with such a plenteous supply of provisions from the <lb/>
            baker, the butcher, and the greengrocer that the guests, even if endowed <lb/>
            with the voracity of a Heracles, will hardly be able to consume them <lb/>
            unless they remain at the table the whole night through. The fragments <lb/>
            of the Comedy are thrown together in all the editions without regard to <lb/>
            their relative positions. I will arrange those relating to the cook in what <lb/>
            I conceive to have been their sequence in the play itself.</p>
          <p>First then, we have the cook starting on his marketing expedition- <figure type="illustration">

              to include them in a collection of Aristophanic fragments is nothing short of an <lb/>

          <p>But our Sicon was not merely a cook; he was an Aeolus of a cook, an <lb/>
            Aeolo-Sicon, just as Xanthias in the Frogs was a Heracleio-Xanthias. <lb/>
            On this side, the play was a satire on the notorious Aeolus of Euripides, <lb/>
            a drama to which Aristophanes refers in the Clouds and the Frogs with <lb/>
            indignant reprobation. There, the children of Aeolus were represented as <lb/>
            leading incestuous lives, in accordance with the legend preserved in the <lb/>
            Odyssey. Here, the daughters of Sicon were apparently represented as <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">πόρναι</foreign>, clad in the transparent vesture which indicated their profession, <lb/>
            sleeping in one room, bathing in one bath, using lights as a signal to <lb/>
            their lovers who would come swarming over the roof and through every <lb/>
            opening. And perhaps all those culinary preparations were for a riotous <lb/>
            banquet for themselves and their lovers, and the woman who laid her <lb/>
            commands upon Sicon may have been his wife or a daughter.</p>
          <p>“ There was a first and a second Aeolosicon of Aristophanes," says <lb/>
            a Scholiast1 on Hephaestion chap. ix, given by Gaisford in his third, <lb/>
            but not in his first, edition, " just as there was a first and a second <lb/>
            Plutus." And Athenaeus also (ix. 13) expressly refers to the " second <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BELL_09_fig28.jpg"/></figure> <lb/>
               <pb n="xxvii"/>
              Aeolosicon." It would be more accurate, in all probability, to compare <lb/>
              the first and second Aeolosicon with the second Plutus and its revision, <lb/>
              or with the first and second editions of the Frogs, than with the first and <lb/>
              second Plutus. But be this as it may, the second Aeolosicon, as well as <lb/>
              the first, is both by the Scholiast on Hephaestion and by Athenaeus <lb/>
              explicitly ascribed to Aristophanes himself, so that however quickly the <lb/>
              second1 may have followed the first, it seems impossible to doubt that <lb/>
              Aristophanes survived the exhibition of the extant Plutus for several <lb/>
              years.</p>
          <p>And then the great poet passed away full of years and honour. He <lb/>
            was born when the Athenian Empire was attaining its widest dominion ; <lb/>
            he had seen the outbreak of the Peloponnesian War, the Peace of Nicias, <lb/>
            the Sicilian catastrophe, the fall of Athens; and he had lived to see the <lb/>
            City he had served so well, again becoming, not indeed the mightiest, <lb/>
            but the most splendid and the most notable of all Hellenic cities.</p>
          <p>The year in which the poet died is as uncertain as the year in which <lb/>
            he was born. Many would place his death as soon after 388, the date of <lb/>
            the present Comedy, as is compatible with the production in the mean­ <lb/>
            time of the two subsequent plays, the Cocalus and the Aeolosicon; but <lb/>
            this is the merest conjecture. On the other hand, Mr. Roland Kent in <lb/>
            the able and interesting article to which reference has been made in the <lb/>
            preceding note, would postpone it to, at the earliest, the year 375. His <lb/>
            argument is based on the following statement of Suidas :— <note type="footnote">1 " May it be permitted to hazard a conjecture as to the reason for the appear­ <lb/>
            ance of the Aeolosicon a second time ? Possibly, like the Frogs, the play received <lb/>
            such a hearty reception that a second performance was demanded, for the public <lb/>
            had not forgotten that it was Aristophanes, the old champion of morality, who was <lb/>
            speaking again in his old age, after a silence of many years." Roland G. Kent in <lb/>
            an article entitled When did Aristophanes die?" Classical Review, xx. 153. <lb/>
            The phrase after a silence of many years" is due to Mr. Kent's belief that the <lb/>
            first Aeolosicon was not exhibited until 375, thirteen years after the Plutus. <lb/>
            Platonius (ubi supra) says <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸν Αἰολοσίκωνα</foreign> ’<foreign xml:lang="grc">Αριστοφάνης ἐδίδαξεν</foreign>, which Fynes <lb/>
            Clinton thinks must refer to the second edition, the first having been exhibited in <lb/>
            the name of Araros ; but I quite agree with Mr. Kent that <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐδίδαξεν</foreign> is there " used, <lb/>
            loosely and inaccurately, for composed." </note> <pb n="xxviii"/>
            <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BELL_09_fig29.jpg"/></figure> <lb/>
              Araros, an Athenian, son of Aristophanes the Comic poet, and himself a Comic <lb/>
              poet, having first exhibited in the JOIst Olympiad. And he wrote the <foreign xml:lang="grc">Καινεὺς</foreign>, &amp;c.</p>
          <p>The 101st Olympiad extended from 376 to 372, the dramatic contests <lb/>
            during that period taking place in the early months of 375 and the three <lb/>
            following years. Therefore, according to Suidas, Araros <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐδίδαξε</foreign> for the <lb/>
            first time in the spring of 375, at the earliest. And as both the <lb/>
            Aeolosicon and the Cocalus were undoubtedly exhibited in the name of <lb/>
            Araros, Mr. Kent concludes that neither of them can have been exhibited <lb/>
            before the spring of 375, and that Aristophanes therefore must at least <lb/>
            have survived to that year. But it seems to me that in the statement <lb/>
            of Suidas, the signification of the word <foreign xml:lang="grc">διδάξας</foreign> is controlled by the <lb/>
            immediate context. It is introduced in connexion with the remark that <lb/>
            Araros was himself a <foreign xml:lang="grc">κωμικὸς</foreign>, that is, a Comic poet, a composer of <lb/>
            original Comedies. The circumstance that his fathers comedies were <lb/>
            brought out in his name would not entitle him to the name of a Comic <lb/>
            poet. Suidas then says, “He was himself a composer of original <lb/>
            comedies having exhibited for the first time in the 101st Olympiad.” <lb/>
            And then he goes on to enumerate-what ? Not the Comedies brought <lb/>
            out in his name, but his original Comedies. It seems to me that Suidas <lb/>
            is throughout treating Araros as an original poet, and is not referring <lb/>
            in any way to Comedies which were composed not by him but by <lb/>
            Aristophanes.</p>
          <p>And in my opinion we cannot say anything more precise about the <lb/>
            date of the poet's death than that he was alive in the year 388, and must <lb/>
            have lived for several years afterwards.</p>

            which we should expect to find rather <lb/>
            in a lyrical poem than in a comic <lb/>
            dialogue. There is probably a play on <lb/>
            the words <foreign xml:lang="grc">βίος</foreign>, life, and <foreign xml:lang="grc">βιὸς</foreign>, a bow; see <lb/>

            was in Thesm. 394 <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὰς προδότιδας, τὰς <lb/>
            λάλους</foreign>, j <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὰς οὐδὲν ὑγιές</foreign>. The expression <lb/>

            Plato too often uses it, and it is <lb/>
            frequently found in the writings of <lb/>
            St. Chrysostom. The general sentiment <lb/>
            of this speech seems to be borrowed <lb/>

            from amongst his wreaths of bay. The <lb/>
            word droned is not really a translation <lb/>
            of <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἔλακεν</foreign>. It is merely intended as an <lb/>
            indication that the original refers to <lb/>
            the high-pitched tone in which the <lb/>
            Pythian priestess delivered the oracles <lb/>
            of the God. Of that tone shrilled or <lb/>
            shrieked would be a more accurate <lb/>
            representation, though less suitable to <lb/>
            the language of Cario. <foreign xml:lang="grc">λάσκειν</foreign> properly <lb/>
            means to crackle, of inanimate things ; <lb/>
            or to scream, like a bird of prey. And <lb/>
            the Scholiasts think that Aristophanes <lb/>
            is using it here, to make fun of its use <lb/>
            by Euripides. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ή λέξις Εὐριπίδον</foreign>, says <lb/>

            a passage in the Ion of Euripides (534- <lb/>
            6) where Xuthus emerging from the <lb/>
            Temple of Delphi, and at once lighting <lb/>
            on Ion, tells him of the oracle he has <lb/>
            just received from Loxias, to the effect <lb/>
            that the first person he meets as he <lb/>
            leaves the Temple will be his own son. <lb/>
            o <foreign xml:lang="grc">δὲ λόγος τίς ἐστὶ φοίβου</foreign> ; asks Ion, and <lb/>
            Xuthus replies <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸν συναντήσαντάμοι .. . <lb/>
            δόμων τω̑νδ</foreign>’ <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐξιόντι του̑ θεου̑ ... πα</foreign>ȋ<foreign xml:lang="grc">δ</foreign>’ <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐμὸν <lb/>

            broken up into fragments because (for <lb/>
            more than thirty lines) he is restricted <lb/>
            to the second half of the trochaic tetra­ <lb/>
            meter, the first half being allotted to <lb/>

            him <foreign xml:lang="grc">σαφω̑ς</foreign>. Cario, adopting the word, <lb/>

            for this there is not the slightest <lb/>

            which seem more appropriate to his <lb/>
            character, as I have endeavoured to do. <lb/>
            It might have been thought that the <lb/>
            references to Wealth in the second <lb/>
            person (<foreign xml:lang="grc">διὰ σὲ</foreign>) would belong to one <lb/>
            speaker, and those in the third person <lb/>
            (8ta <foreign xml:lang="grc">τοῦτον</foreign>) to the other; but this <lb/>
            arrangement does not work out satis­ <lb/>
            factorily. See the Scholium quoted in <lb/>
            the note on 190 infra. <note type="footnote"> c </note></p><pb n="18"/>

          <p>166. <foreign xml:lang="grc">γναφεύει</foreign>] Whether this word <lb/>
            should commence with a y or a K has <lb/>
            been the subject of great dispute, a dis­ <lb/>
            pute so bitter, Lucian tells us, that the <lb/>
            two letters, gamma and kappa, nearly <lb/>
            came to blows on the question; <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐς <lb/>
            χεῖρας μικροῦ δεῖν ἤρχετο</foreign>. Jud. Voc. 4, <lb/>
            where see Hemsterhuys's note. The <lb/>
            grammarians say, some that <foreign xml:lang="grc">κναφεύει</foreign> <lb/>
            was the older, and <foreign xml:lang="grc">γναφεύει</foreign> the later <lb/>
            Attic form; and some that <foreign xml:lang="grc">κνφεύει</foreign> was <lb/>
            the special Attic spelling, and <foreign xml:lang="grc">γναφεύει</foreign> <lb/>
            the common or Hellenic spelling. The <lb/>
            latter distinction tells in favour of <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">γναφεύει</foreign> here, since Aristophanes, as <lb/>
            was natural in a writer whose plays, <lb/>
            at the Great Dionysia, would be per­ <lb/>
            formed not before Athenians only but <lb/>
            before strangers from all friendly <lb/>
            Hellenic states, preferred the general <lb/>
            Hellenic forms to the mere Attic pro­ <lb/>
            vincialisms. Moreover, according to <lb/>
            Dawes, the preceding e though it would <lb/>
            be long before <foreign xml:lang="grc">γν</foreign>-, would be short before <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">κν</foreign>- (Misc. Crit. p. 196); and although <lb/>
            his rules are mere counsels of perfec­ <lb/>
            tion, and are frequently disregarded by <lb/>
            the poets, yet they do sufficiently indi­ <lb/>
            cate their general practice.</p>
          <p>168. <foreign xml:lang="grc">διὰ</foreign> a-c <foreign xml:lang="grc">που παρατίλλεται</foreign>] Ata is <lb/>
            here universally translated for want of; <lb/>
            a sense in which it appears to be used <lb/>
            supra 147, but which is quite contrary <lb/>
            to its ordinary meaning, and to the <lb/>
            meaning which it bears everywhere else <lb/>
            in the present passage. Even in line <lb/>
            147 it requires to be supplemented by <lb/>
            the explanation <foreign xml:lang="grc">διὰ τὸ μὴ πλουτε</foreign>î<foreign xml:lang="grc">ν ἴσως</foreign>. <lb/>
            And it seems most probable that it is <lb/>
            here employed in its ordinary significa­ <lb/>
            tion, and that the adulterer's depilation <lb/>
            is due not to his poverty but to his <lb/>
            wealth. For a husband, catching an <lb/>
            adulterer with his wife, was by law <lb/>
            permitted to put him to death. The <lb/>
            law is set out in Demosthenes Against <lb/>
            Aristocrates 59, and is illustrated by <lb/>
            the speech of Lysias De caede Era­ <lb/>
            tosthenis. But a wealthy adulterer <lb/>
            might possibly, by the payment of <lb/>
            a large sum of money, bribe the hus­ <lb/>
            band to remit the extreme penalty of</p><pb n="19"/>
            
          <p>For thee one sits and cobbles all the day, <lb/>
            One works in bronze, another works in wood, <lb/>
            One fuses gold-the gold derived from thee-</p>
          <p>CAR. One plies the footpad's, one the burglary trade,</p>
          <p>CH. One is a fuller, one a sheepskin-washer, <lb/>
            One is a tanner, one an onion-seller, <lb/>
            Through thee the nabbed adulterer gets off plucked.</p>
          <p>WE. 0, and all this I never knew before !</p>
          <p>CH. Aye 'tis on him the Great King plumes himself; <lb/>
            And our Assemblies all are held for him; <lb/>
            Dost thou not man our triremes ? Answer that.</p>
          <p>the law, and to let him off either scot­ <lb/>
            free ([Demosthenes] Against Neaera 84), <lb/>
            or with some less punishment. "Dedit <lb/>
            hic pro corpore nummos," as Horace <lb/>
            says. And it may well be that in some <lb/>
            recent case, well-known to the audience, <lb/>
            the husband had accepted a bribe to <lb/>
            spare the adulterer's life, and content <lb/>
            himself with the minor penalty of depila­ <lb/>
            tion. <foreign xml:lang="grc">Οὔτω γὰρ</foreign>, says the Scholiast on <lb/>
            Clouds 1083, <foreign xml:lang="grc">τοὺς ἁλόντας μοιχοὺς ᾔκιξον <lb/>
            ... παρατίλλοντες αὐτοὺς, θερμὴν τέφραν <lb/>
            ἐπέπασσον</foreign>. In that case therefore the <lb/>
            detected adulterer would, by means <lb/>
            of his wealth, have escaped with a <lb/>
            plucking.</p>
          <p>170. <foreign xml:lang="grc">μέγας βασιλεύς</foreign>] The Persian <lb/>
            monarch was to the Hellenes the <lb/>
            personification of riches. Herodotus <lb/>
            is constantly alluding to the vast wealth <lb/>
            at his disposal. And Persian gold was <lb/>
            at this time an important factor in the <lb/>
            combinations of Hellenic states.</p>
          <p>171. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐκκλησία</foreign>] For after the termina­ <lb/>
            tion of the Peloponnesian War and the <lb/>
            downfall of the Athenian Empire, the <lb/>
            people for a time lost all interest in <lb/>
            political matters, and ceased to attend <lb/>
            the public assemblies. Nor did the <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐκκλησιαστικὸν</foreign>, or feefor attending the <lb/>
            assembly, suffice, so long as it was but <lb/>
            one obol, to overcome their apathy. <lb/>
            But when it was raised to three obols, <lb/>
            all this was changed; there was a general <lb/>
            rush to attend, and the meetings again <lb/>
            became crowded. See infra 329 ; Eccl. <lb/>
            183-8, 300-10, and the notes there; and <lb/>
            the note on Eccl. 102.</p>
          <p>172. <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὰς τριήρεις</foreign>] This would always <lb/>
            be true ; but there is probably a special <lb/>
            allusion here to the enormous expense <lb/>
            incurred, since the formation of the <lb/>
            Anti-Spartan League (B. c. 395), in re­ <lb/>
            suscitating the Athenian fleet; an <lb/>
            expense which would fall all the more <lb/>
            heavily on the citizens, because the <lb/>
            Athenian treasury was no longer filled <lb/>
            with the tribute exacted from the subject <lb/>
            allies. Hence no doubt the necessity of <lb/>
            raising the sum of 500 talents mentioned <lb/>
            in Eccl. 823-9. <note type="footnote"> c a </note></p><pb n="20"/>

            Legion, the mercenary force established <lb/>
            by Conon at Corinth, B.C. 393, in con­ <lb/>
            nexion with the Anti-Spartan League. <lb/>
            It had recently distinguished itself, <lb/>
            under the command of Iphicrates, by <lb/>
            the sensational destruction of a Spartan <lb/>
            mora. See the Introduction.</p>
          <p>174. <foreign xml:lang="grc">Πάμφιλος</foreign>] Of Pamphilus, and his <lb/>
            satellite Aristoxenus, the needle-seller <lb/>
            (6 <foreign xml:lang="grc">βελονοπώλης</foreign>), we know only what the <lb/>
            Scholiasts tell us. He seems to have <lb/>
            been a worthless demagogue, who <lb/>
            embezzled the public money; and being <lb/>
            detected was punished by the confisca­ <lb/>
            tion of his property. In the crime and <lb/>
            in the punishment his hanger-on and <lb/>
            parasite was involved. The Scholiast <lb/>
            quotes from the Amphiaraus of Plato— <figure type="illustration">

              tripody, if I may give that name to <lb/>
              a trochaic dimeter brachycatalectic. <lb/>
              There is no mention elsewhere of an <lb/>
              "Amphiaraus" of Plato ; and probably <lb/>
              for <foreign xml:lang="grc">Ἀμφιαράῳ</foreign> we should read <foreign xml:lang="grc">ταῖς ἀφ᾽ <lb/>
              ίερῶν</foreign>, a well-known comedy of that <lb/>
              poet. See Meineke's Hist. Crit. p. <lb/>
              167.) This Pamphilus has nothing to <lb/>
              do with the painter mentioned infra <lb/>
              385.</p>
          <p>176. <foreign xml:lang="grc">Ἀγύρριος</foreign>] Of Agyrrhius, a very <lb/>
            conspicuous personage at this time, we <lb/>
            have already heard in the Ecclesiazusae. <lb/>
            See the notes on lines 102, 176, and 183 <lb/>
            of that play. He was the notorious <lb/>
            demagogue, whose introduction of the <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐκκλησιαστικὸν</foreign> made him the most <lb/>
            popular man in Athens. On the death <lb/>
            of Thrasybulus, he had succeeded to his <lb/>
            command, and become both wealthy <lb/>
            and arrogant. His insolence is signi­ <lb/>
            fied by the word <foreign xml:lang="grc">πέρδεται</foreign>, which means <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">στρηνιᾷ πλουτῶν</foreign> as the Scholiast says. <lb/>

            precise transaction to which this line <lb/>
            refers; but we know that about this <lb/>
            time both the Egyptians and the <lb/>
            Athenians were lending some support <lb/>
            to Evagoras of Cyprus in his contest <lb/>
            with the Persian Empire ; and no doubt <lb/>
            some dealing took place between them <lb/>
            in that connexion which accounts for <lb/>
            the present observation.</p>
          <p>179. <foreign xml:lang="grc">Φιλωνίδου</foreign>] Philonides of Melite <lb/>
            was a bulky and clumsy blockhead with <lb/>
            a voice like the braying of a jackass. <lb/>
            The wits of Athens dubbed him an <lb/>
            “ass " and the "son of an ass." Several <lb/>
            gibes at his expense are quoted by the <lb/>
            Scholiast from the Comic Poets. Thus <lb/>

              But he had plenty of money; and <lb/>
              therefore, repulsive as he was in mind <lb/>
              and body, Lais the Corinthian courtesan <lb/>
              was willing to accept him as her lover, <lb/>
              and led him into every sort of excess and <lb/>
              debauchery: see infra 303. There were <lb/>
              several courtesans of that name ; but <lb/>
              doubtless this was the original Lais, the <lb/>
              famous beauty who when quite a child <lb/>
              was among the captives taken by the <lb/>
              Athenians in Sicily B.C. 415; her native <lb/>
              town, Hyccara, being sacked by Nicias, <lb/>
              and all its inhabitants sold into slavery. <lb/>
              Accordingtothe Scholiast's calculations, <lb/>
              she would not have been more than <lb/>
              thirty-four at the date of the Plutus, an <lb/>
              age at which she may well have proved <lb/>
              irresistible to the boorish Athenian; and <lb/>
              although the Scholiast tells us that <lb/>
              Plato in a comedy exhibited three years <lb/>
              before the Plutus spoke of her as no <lb/>
              longer in existence, yet, he adds very <lb/>
              sensibly, it is possible that she was <lb/>
              alive when this was said. And we may <lb/>
              be sure that she was so, since, years <lb/>
              after this, Epicrates wrote a comedy <lb/>
              about her called the "Anti-Lais," and <lb/>
              described her as an old woman who had <lb/>
              lost all her charms and all her popu­ <lb/>
              larity. Athenaeus (xiii. chap. 62), refer­ <lb/>
              ring to a speech of Lysias in which <lb/>
              Philonides is said to have been en­ <lb/>

              is of course possible; but all the MSS. <lb/>
              have <foreign xml:lang="grc">Λαὶς</foreign>, and this very observation of <lb/>
              Athenaeus makes it plain that <foreign xml:lang="grc">Λαὶς</foreign> was <lb/>
              the reading in his day. And although <lb/>
              his suggestion is worth recording, it <lb/>
              would be unwise to adopt it.</p>

            son of the famous Conon, and in later <lb/>
            life himself a most distinguished officer, <lb/>
            became on his father's death a year or <lb/>
            two before the exhibition of this play <lb/>
            the possessor of considerable wealth. <lb/>
            He therefore commenced to build, at <lb/>
            Athens, a magnificent mansion adorned <lb/>
            with a lofty tower, which was possibly <lb/>

            Lucian has it in his Timon (3 and 23), <lb/>

            needy agriculturists, <foreign xml:lang="grc">τοὺς ξυγγεώργους</foreign>, <lb/>
            now makes his reappearance on the <lb/>
            stage, while the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ξυγγέωργοι</foreign>, who form <lb/>
            the Chorus of the play, come bustling <lb/>
            down the <foreign xml:lang="grc">εἴσοδος</foreign> into the orchestra. <lb/>
            They and Cario are old friends, and as <lb/>
            they follow him (though not by the <lb/>
            same route) into the theatre, they <lb/>
            bandy about between them a lot <lb/>
            of rustic jokes, culminating in the <lb/>
            pleasantry of a coarse, but jovial, <lb/>
            country-dance. So it happens that in <lb/>
            the last extant Comedy of Aristophanes <lb/>
            as in the first (Ach. 241-79) we have <lb/>
            a graphic representation of the amuse­ <lb/>
            ments of Athenian rustics. <foreign xml:lang="grc">πολλὰ</foreign> is <lb/>
            equivalent, as the Scholiast observes, to <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">πολλάκις; θύμον</foreign> is said by some to be <lb/>
            the wild onion; but it seems safer to <lb/>
            retain the word thyme. I cannot agree <lb/>
            with Bergler that there is here a play <lb/>
            upon the words <foreign xml:lang="grc">θυ̍̆μον</foreign>, thyme, and <foreign xml:lang="grc">θν̄μὸς</foreign>, <lb/>
            spirit; or any allusion in <foreign xml:lang="grc">θύμον φαγόντες</foreign> <lb/>
            to the Homeric <foreign xml:lang="grc">ν θυμὸν κατέδων</foreign>. The <lb/>
            whole atmosphere of the passage is <lb/>
            against any allusion of the kind.</p><pb n="30"/>

            this adverb is introduced merely to <lb/>

            sooth, or the like. So supra 148, infra <lb/>
            1080. There is no ground for the <lb/>
            suggestion of the Scholiast and Com­ <lb/>
            mentators that in the present line it <lb/>
            means equally with you, that is, as fast <lb/>
            as you. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀξιοι̑ς</foreign> means You claim that <lb/>

            sonates the Cyclops, capering about <lb/>
            with wild and disorderly gestures; <lb/>

          <p>their vehement dancing in the or­ <lb/>
            chestra, against Cario dancing on the <lb/>

            the Adriatic, and to have found a con­ <lb/>
            genial home in Italy. For it was doubt­ <lb/>
            less to a dance of this description that <lb/>
            Horace alludes in the passages already <lb/>
            cited by many commentators, Pastorem <lb/>
            saltaret uti Cyclopa, Sat. i. 5. 63, and <lb/>
            Ludentis speciem dabit et torquebitur, ut <lb/>
            qui I Nunc Satyrum, nunc agrestem <lb/>

            metre is throughout iambic, tetra­ <lb/>
            meter, trimeter, or dimeter. The word <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">θρεττανλὸ</foreign> does not enter into the <lb/>
            construction of the sentence; it is <lb/>
            merely an imitation of the twanging of <lb/>
            the lyre. The Scholiasts tell us that <lb/>
            both this word and the line <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀλλ'εἶα, <lb/>
            τέκεα, θαμίν' ἐπαναβοω̑ντες</foreign> are taken from <lb/>
            the Loves of Galatea and the Cyclops" <lb/>
            the famous lyrical drama by Philoxenus <lb/>
            of Cythera, which is mentioned by <lb/>
            Aristotle (Poetics 4), Aelian (V. H. xii. <lb/>
            44), and others. Philoxenus, being in <lb/>
            Sicily, the Scholiasts tell us, fell in <lb/>
            love with Galatea, the mistress of <lb/>
            Dionysius the Elder. The intrigue was <lb/>
            detected by Dionysius who, by way of <lb/>
            punishment, sent the poet to work in <lb/>
            the stone-quarries. Escaping thence, <lb/>
            he took his revenge upon Dionysius by <lb/>
            publishing this pastoral drama, in <lb/>
            which the Cyclops was made a vehicle <lb/>
            for caricaturing Dionysius; and Galatea <lb/>
            and he were represented as a sort of <lb/>
            "Beauty and the Beast." In later <lb/>
            times the love of the Cyclops for Galatea <lb/>
            was treated as part of the original <lb/>
            legend without any reference to Diony­ <lb/>
            sius ; and formed the subject of an <lb/>
            Idyll of Theocritus, a dialogue of Lucian, <lb/>
            and a tale in the Metamorphoses of <lb/>
            Ovid, besides innumerable references <lb/>

            you, ye he-goats, shall have your breakfast. <lb/>
            He speaks to his companions as if they <lb/>
            were the flocks <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὄϊές τε καὶ αἶγες</foreign> (Od. ix. <lb/>

            <foreign xml:lang="grc">θαμωὰ</foreign> is equivalent to <foreign xml:lang="grc">θαμὰ</foreign> incessantly. <lb/>
            The Scholiast took <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀκρατιει̑σθε</foreign>to be <lb/>

            it by <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀκρατη̑πράσσετε</foreign>; but the second <lb/>

            Odyssey burnt out with a fiery stake the <lb/>
            single eye of the Cyclops, and they are <lb/>

            not Odysseus but his comrades whom <lb/>
            the Circe he is representing turned into <lb/>
            swine; and perhaps there is also a <lb/>
            reminiscence of that familiar Attic <lb/>
            idiom whereby <foreign xml:lang="grc">οἱ ἀμΦί Φιλωνίδη</foreign> is merely <lb/>
            a periphrasis for Philonides himself.</p>
          <p>308. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἕπεσθε μητρὶ χοι̑ροι</foreign>] This little <lb/>
            refrain has no immediate connexion <lb/>
            with the context. If it is not taken <lb/>
            from the pastoral drama of Philoxenus, <lb/>
            we may conjecture that it was a sort of <lb/>
            catch-word, so to say, in these rustic <lb/>
            merry-makings, an exhortation perhaps <lb/>
            to the village yokels to "follow their <lb/>
            leader" in some game or dance.</p>
          <p>313. <foreign xml:lang="grc">μινθώσομεν</foreign>] We will rub your <lb/>
            nose, as if it were a goat's, in dung. <lb/>
            Apparently some filthy trick of this <lb/>
            kind had been played upon some disre­ <lb/>
            putable young fellow named Aristyllus; <lb/>
            see Ecclesiazusae 644-8, and the notes <lb/>
            there. Though the Chorus address <lb/>
            Cario as Circe, they do not forget that <lb/>
            they are really addressing a man, and <lb/>
            adapt their language to his sex.</p>

            We'll hang you up as you erst were hung <lb/>

            No longer play the fool to-day. <lb/>
            And ye must sail on another tack, <lb/>
            Whilst I, behind my masters back, <lb/>

          <p>322. <foreign xml:lang="grc">χαίρειν μέν</foreign>] Cario goes into the <lb/>
            house to get his bread and meat, and <lb/>
            Chremylus comes out to welcome the <lb/>
            visitors. The salutation <foreign xml:lang="grc">χαίρειν</foreign>, he says, <lb/>
            is <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀρχαι̑ον</foreign>, by which he means old­ <lb/>
            fashioned; but Lucian in his little <lb/>
            apology "Pro lapsu in salutando " when <lb/>
            he observes <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸ μὲν δὴ χαίρεινἀρχαία μὲν <lb/>
            ή προσαγόρευσθς</foreign>, though he doubtless <lb/>
            has his eye on the present passage, yet <lb/>
            means by <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀρχαία</foreign> merely the ancient or <lb/>
            original form of salutation. Lucian <lb/>
            shows by examples from Homer and <lb/>
            others that it was formerly used on any <lb/>
            occasion, and not, as in Lucian's own <lb/>
            time, merely as a morning salutation ; <lb/>

            The Chorus reply'in the same style; <lb/>

          <p>CH. And here, I see, comes Blepsidemus too. <lb/>
            Look ! by his speed and bearing you can tell <lb/>
            He has heard a rumour of whales happening here.</p>
          <p>BLEPSIDEMUS. What can it mean ? Old Chremylus grown wealthy! <lb/>
            Then whence and how ? I don't believe that story. <lb/>
            And yet by Heracles 'twas bruited wide <lb/>
            Amongst the loungers in the barbers' shops <lb/>
            That Chremylus had all at once grown rich. <lb/>
            And if he has, 'tis passing wonderful <lb/>
            That he should callhis neighbours in to share. <lb/>
            That's not our country's fashion, anyhow.</p>

          <p>338. <foreign xml:lang="grc">κουρείοισι</foreign>] In these barbers' shops <lb/>

              it was introduced by Menander into his <lb/>

              still found, in a Latin form, in Terence's <lb/>

            so vast an outlay on her fleets and forti­ <lb/>

            by her adhesion to the Anti-Spartan <lb/>

            was unable to continue the large salaries <lb/>

            At this moment, indeed, Aegina was in <lb/>
            the hands of the enemies of Athens, <lb/>
            but I do not know that this would <lb/>
            make any difference in a Comic Play; <lb/>
            and of course it was otherwise in 408 <lb/>
            B. c. when the first Plutus was acted. <lb/>
            And the statement (infra 653-6) that as <lb/>
            soon as the little party arrived at the <lb/>
            Temple, they bathed Wealth in the sea <lb/>
            seems rather to point to Aegina, for <lb/>
            the Athenian Temple was close to <lb/>
            the acropolis, between the Theatre and <lb/>

            the sea, Pausanias, Attica xxi. 7. There <lb/>
            was, indeed, a Temple of Asclepius in <lb/>

            deny the charge she brings. It is <lb/>
            admitted; and becomes the basis of the <lb/>
            ensuing discussion. The fact is that <lb/>
            Aristophanes is quietly introducing­ <lb/>
            so quietly that it seems to have escaped <lb/>
            the notice of every Scholiast and Com­ <lb/>
            mentator—an entirely new idea; an <lb/>
            idea which dominates the controversy <lb/>
            between Poverty and the two friends, <lb/>
            and then disappears as suddenly as it <lb/>
            came, only making its reappearance <lb/>
            in the concluding scene of the play. <lb/>

            all bad men are poor, the bad will begin <lb/>
            to see the advantages of virtue, and <lb/>
            finding that " honesty is the best <lb/>
            policy " will themselves become good <lb/>
            and, as a consequence, wealthy. Thus <lb/>
            at length all will be rich (infra 1178), <lb/>
            and none will be poor; and Poverty <lb/>
            will be banished out of the land. SSe <lb/>

            in no way deserves the reception with <lb/>
            which it meets at the hands of Dr. <lb/>
            Blaydes. " Miror," he says, " neminem <lb/>

            and finally it would make nonsense of <lb/>
            Poverty's reply which is directed against <lb/>
            the proposition, not that the good are <lb/>
            to be enriched, but that all are to be <lb/>
            rich, and none to be poor, so that <lb/>

            that such was Poverty's meaning, adds <lb/>
            " Yes for a thief (<foreign xml:lang="grc">κκέπτης</foreign> understood <lb/>
            from Chremylus's <foreign xml:lang="grc">κλέπτειν</foreign>) is so modest <lb/>
            that he keeps out of sight." Chremylus <lb/>

          <p>Fat rogues with big bellies and dropsical legs, whose toes by the gout are tormented; <lb/>
            But mine are the lean and the wasplike and keen, who strike at their foemen and sting <lb/>
            them.</p>
          <p>CH. Ah, yes; to a wasplike condition, no doubt, by the pinch of starvation you bring them.</p>
          <p>Pov. I can show you besides that Decorum abides with those whom I visit; that mine <lb/>
            Are the modest and orderly folk, and that Wealthy are with insolence flushed and <lb/>
            with wine."</p>
          <p>CH. 'Tis an orderly job, then, to thieve and to rob and to break into houses by night.</p>
          <p>BL. Such modesty too ! In whatever they do they are careful to keep out of sight.</p>
          <p>Pov. Behold in the cities the Orator tribe; when poor in their early career <lb/>
            How faithful and just to the popular trust, how true to the State they appear. <lb/>
            When wealth at the City's expense they have gained, they are worsened at once by the pelf, <lb/>
            Intriguing the popular cause to defeat, attacking the People itself.</p>
          <p>CH. That is perfectly true though 'tis spoken by you, you spiteful malevolent witch ! <lb/>
            But still you shall squall for contending that all had better be poor than be rich. <lb/>
            So don't be elate; for a terrible fate shall your steps overtake before long.</p>
          <p>Pov. Why, I haven't yet heard the ghost of a word to prove my contention is wrong. <lb/>
            You splutter and try to flutter and fly; but of argument never a letter.</p>
          <p>CH. Pray why do all people abhor you and shun ? Pov. Because I'm for making them better. <lb/>
            So children, we see, from their parents will flee who would teach them the way they <lb/>
            should go.</p>
          <p>steal, but (ironically) that it was; and <lb/>
            Blepsidemus carries on the jest. They <lb/>
            are both ironical at Poverty's expense. <lb/>
            The idea expressed by Blepsidemus is <lb/>
            found in St. Chrysostom's Tenth Homily <lb/>
            on 1 Thess. (500 F). The <foreign xml:lang="grc">πλεονέκτης</foreign>, he <lb/>
            says, is worse than a thief. For the <lb/>
            latter <foreign xml:lang="grc">καὶ τῷ κρύπτεσθαι καὶ τῷ ἐν νυκτὶ <lb/>

            which in all the MSS. and earlier <lb/>
            editions are continued to Chremylus <lb/>
            were transferred to Blepsidemus by <lb/>
            Bentley, whose alteration is adopted by <lb/>
            Brunck and all subsequent editors. <lb/>
            I certainly do not think that the mere <lb/>
            transition from the second to the third <lb/>
            person (<foreign xml:lang="grc">φήσεις, ταύτην</foreign>) would justify the <lb/>
            alteration, for such a transition is by no <lb/>
            means uncommon, and is sufficiently <lb/>
            explained here by the Scholiast, TO <foreign xml:lang="grc">μὲν</foreign> <lb/>

            the emphatic <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἄμφω</foreign> in the succeeding <lb/>

            Zeus wealthy ! Not he : he's as poor as can be: and this I can prove in a minute. <lb/>
            If Zeus be so wealthy, how came it of yore that out of his riches abounding <lb/>
            He could find but a wreath of wild olive for those who should win at the games he was <lb/>
            founding, <lb/>
            By all the Hellenes in each fourth year on Olympiads plains to be holden ? <lb/>
            If Zeus were as wealthy and rich as you say, the wreath should at least have been golden.</p>
          <p>On. It is plain, I should think, 'tis from love of the chink that the conduct you mention arises ; <lb/>

            And some early transcriber, remember­ <lb/>

          <p>BL. I too have a mind for an opulent life <lb/>
            Of revel and mirth with my children and wife, <lb/>
            Untroubled by Poverty's panics. <lb/>
            And then as I'm passing, all shiny and bright, <lb/>
            From my bath to my supper, what joy and delight <lb/>
            My fingers to snap in disdain at the sight <lb/>
            Of herself and her frowsy mechanics.</p>
          <p>CH. That cursed witch, thank Heaven, has gone and left us. <lb/>
            But you and I will take the God at once <lb/>

          <p>(They both leave the stage, and a whole night is supposed to pass. It is now tho next day, and <lb/>

          <p>627. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὦ πλει̑στα κ.τ.λ</foreign>.] Cario runs in, <lb/>

            night. He is alone on the stage, and <lb/>
            greets with accents of joy the Chorus <lb/>
            in the orchestra. This second address <lb/>
            commences in much the same style as <lb/>
            the first, supra 253, though in somewhat <lb/>
            grander language; and <foreign xml:lang="grc">πλει̑στα</foreign> means <lb/>
            very often here, just as <foreign xml:lang="grc">πολλὰ</foreign> meant <lb/>
            often there. At the feasts of Theseus, <lb/>
            in token of the unity which he intro­ <lb/>
            duced into the Athenian commonwealth, <lb/>
            the poorer classes were entertained <lb/>
            at a meal, apparently not of a very <lb/>
            sumptuous character, provided at the <lb/>
            public cost. The meal se ms to have <lb/>
            consisted of porridge and barley-bread ; <lb/>
            and the guests hollowed out bits of the <lb/>
            bread as scoops wherewith to eat the <lb/>
            porridge. A scoop so made was called <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">μυστίλη</foreign>, and <foreign xml:lang="grc">μεμυστιλημένοι</foreign> means ye <lb/>

              barley-meal. These workhouse meals, <lb/>
              as we may almost deem them, were <lb/>
              formerly reckoned luxurious by these <lb/>
              poor old men, but now what a change <lb/>
              is impending in their ideas and pro­ <lb/>
              spects !</p>
          <p>631. <foreign xml:lang="grc">τω̑ν σαυτου̑ φίλων</foreign>] The expres­ <lb/>
            sion <foreign xml:lang="grc">οἱ σαυτου̑ φίλοι</foreign> had obviously been <lb/>
            employed by some author of the day to <lb/>
            denote the fellow-slaves of the person <lb/>
            addressed. In ridicule of this affected <lb/>
            phrase, the Chorus are here made to <lb/>
            call Cario " best of thy fellow-slaves " <lb/>
            (a phrase like "fairest of her daughters <lb/>
            Eve”) ; whilst infra 1134 Hermes, the <lb/>
            servant of Olympus, speaking to the <lb/>
            same Cario, describes himself as his <lb/>
            fellow-slave, <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸν σαυτου̑ φίλον</foreign>. The <lb/>
            Scholiasts are not quite agreed as to <lb/>
            the meaning of the expression, but the <lb/>
            explanation <foreign xml:lang="grc">τω̑ν ὁμομαστιγιω̑ν</foreign> which some <lb/>
            of them give, is undoubtedly correct.</p>
          <p>635, 636. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐξωμμάτωται. . . τυχών</foreign>] These <lb/>
            two lines are borrowed from the Phineus <lb/>
            of Sophocles, and doubtless refer, in <lb/>
            the Tragedy, to one of the sons of <lb/>
            Phineus. They were blinded by their <lb/>
            father or (as Sophocles says, Antigone <lb/>
            973) by their stepmother, his second <lb/>
            wife. For this cruelty, Phineus, him­ <lb/>
            self blinded, was condemned to the <lb/>
            misery of the Harpy-assaults, and <lb/>
            Asclepius restored sight to the sons. <lb/>
            See the Scholiast on Find. Pyth. iii. 96. <lb/>
            This seems the clear meaning of the <lb/>
            lines of Sophocles, and we need not <lb/>
            trouble ourselves with the cobwebs <lb/>
            which learned men have woven about <lb/>
            them, on the supposition that they are <lb/>
            intended to apply to Phineus himself. <pb n="71"/>
             </p>
          <p>Who, at the feast of Theseus, many a time <lb/>
            Have ladled up small sops of barley-broth ! <lb/>
            Here's joy for you and all good folk besides.</p>
          <p>CHop.. How now, you best of all your fellow-knaves ? <lb/>
            You seem to come a messenger of good.</p>
          <p>CAR. With happiest fortune has my master sped, <lb/>
            Or rather Wealth himself; no longer blind, <lb/>
            He hath relumed the brightness of his eyes, <lb/>
            So kind a Healer hath Asclepius proved.</p>
          <p>CHOR. (Singing.) Joy for the news you bring. Joy ! Joy ! with shouts I sing.</p>
          <p>CAR. Aye, will you, nill you, it is joy indeed.</p>
          <p>CHOP. (Singing.) Sing we with all our might, Asclepius first and best, <lb/>
            To men a glorious light, Sire in his offspring blest.</p>
          <p>WIFE. What means this shouting ? Has good news arrived ? <lb/>
            For I've been sitting till I'm tired within</p>
          <p>637. <foreign xml:lang="grc">λέγεις κ.τ.λ</foreign>.] In answer to the <lb/>
            joyful news which Cario brings, the <lb/>
            Chorus raise a shout of delight; <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀπαγγέλλεις μοι, φησὶ, χαρα̑ς ἄξιον, ὥστε <lb/>
            καὶ βοα̑ν τη̑</foreign> xap9 <foreign xml:lang="grc">νικώμενον</foreign>.—Scholiast; <lb/>
            and he adds, <foreign xml:lang="grc">τινὰ γελᾷ τω̑ν τραγικω̑ν</foreign>.</p>
          <p>639. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀναβοάσομαι ... Ἀσκληπιόν</foreign>] In <lb/>
            this acclaim, as in the preceding, we <lb/>
            have the diction of Tragedy, <foreign xml:lang="grc">εὔπαιδα <lb/>
            λεγει τὸν Ἀσκληπιὸν</foreign>, says the Scholiast, <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὡς καλλίστος ἔχοντα παι̑δας, Μαχάονα, <lb/>
            Ποδαλείριον, Ίασὼ, Πανάκειαν, καὶ</foreign> ‘<foreign xml:lang="grc">Υγίειαν</foreign>. <lb/>
            But probably the allusion goes beyond <lb/>
            the actual children, and embraces all <lb/>
            the race of the Asclepiads, of whom the <lb/>
            most prominent representative at this <lb/>
            moment was the celebrated Hippocrates <lb/>
            of Cos, <foreign xml:lang="grc">τω̑ν Ἀσκληπιαδω̑ν</foreign> o aptaTos, as <lb/>
            the Emperor Julian calls him in his <lb/>
            59th letter. The expression <foreign xml:lang="grc">μέγα βρο­ <lb/>
            τοι̑σ ι φέγγος</foreign> is quite in the style of the <lb/>
            usual poetical eulogies of Asclepius. <lb/>
            Bentley refers to Lucian's Alexander <lb/>
            18, where the impostor of that name, <lb/>
            passing himself off as a reincarnation <lb/>
            of Asclepius, proclaims <foreign xml:lang="grc">Εὶμὶ Γλύκων, <lb/>
            τρίτον αἷμα Διὸς, φάος ἀνθρώποισιν</foreign>. So <lb/>
            in the Oracle recording his birth he is <lb/>
            addressed as cJ <foreign xml:lang="grc">μέγα χάρμα βροτοι̑ς <lb/>

            tions of the Chorus have reached the <lb/>
            ears of the wife within the house ; and <lb/>
            she runs out, all excitement, to hear <lb/>
            the news. Cario rather plays with her <lb/>
            impatience, and she in line 648 replies <lb/>
            in the ordinary tone of tragic exhorta­ <lb/>

          <p>650. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐς τὴν κεφαλήν σοι</foreign>] Cario merely <lb/>
            means that he will tell the whole story <lb/>
            from the beginning to the end, " from <lb/>
            top to toe"; but his mistress catches <lb/>
            him up on the words <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐς κεφαλήν σοι</foreign>, <lb/>
            which form a common imprecation, most <lb/>
            frequently, as in 526 supra, employed <lb/>
            in retorts.</p>
          <p>653, 654. <foreign xml:lang="grc">θεὸν ... ἄνδρα</foreign>] Throughout <lb/>

            Man.</p>
          <p>656. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπὶ θάλατταν</foreign>] This bath in the <lb/>
            sea signified the purification of the <lb/>
            patient before he presumed to submit <lb/>
            himself to the healing operations of <lb/>
            the God. <foreign xml:lang="grc">θάλασσα κλύζει πάντα τἀν­ <lb/>

            water (Xen. Mem. iii. 13 (3)), possibly <lb/>
            containing drugs calculated to ensure <lb/>
            sleep and dreams. The Wife's shiver <lb/>
            at the notion of a cold sea'bath would <lb/>
            be natural at the season, the winter or <lb/>
            early spring, at which the performance <lb/>

            There on the altar honey-cakes and bakemeats <lb/>
            Were offered, food for the Hephaestian flame.</p>
          <p>which at Epidaurus was nearly a mile <lb/>
            in circumference, and contained various <lb/>
            temples and statues, a theatre, a <lb/>
            stadium, and other edifices. Leake's <lb/>
            Morea, ii. 423. Conspicuous among <lb/>
            them was the great columnar <foreign xml:lang="grc">στοὰ</foreign>, <lb/>
            within which the patients slept, and <lb/>
            which adjoined the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἄβατον</foreign> or <foreign xml:lang="grc">νεὼς</foreign>, the <lb/>
            special sanctuary of Asclepius himself.</p>
          <p>660. <foreign xml:lang="grc">πόπανα</foreign>] These were small plain <lb/>

            ἢ πλακούντια</foreign>, as the Scholiast says. On <lb/>
            the present occasion there would be no <lb/>
            victim sacrificed, but Bluster is doubt­ <lb/>
            less right in observing that the name <lb/>

            even though, as in the offerings of the <lb/>
            poor, no sacrifice of a victim was in <lb/>

          <p>CAR. Neocleides was, for one; the purblind man, <lb/>
            Who in his thefts out-shoots the keenest-eyed. <lb/>
            And many others, sick with every form <lb/>
            Of ailment. Soon the Temple servitor <lb/>
            Put out the lights, and bade us fall asleep, <lb/>
            Nor stir, nor speak, whatever noise we heard. <lb/>
            So down we lay in orderly repose. <lb/>
            And I could catch no slumber, not one wink, <lb/>
            Struck by a nice tureen of broth which stood <lb/>
            A little distance from an old wife's head, <lb/>
            Whereto I marvellously longed to creep. <lb/>
            Then, glancing upwards, I behold the priest <lb/>
            Whipping the cheese-cakes and the figs from off <lb/>
            The holy table; thence he coasted round <lb/>
            To every altar, spying what was left. <lb/>
            And everything he found he consecrated <lb/>

            for its preparation is given by Athenaeus <lb/>
            xiv. 57. Cheese after being ground and <lb/>
            pressed was to be passed through a metal <lb/>
            sifter. Being thus reduced into fine <lb/>
            strips or threads, it was to be beaten <lb/>
            up with honey and half a pint of the <lb/>
            finest wheat flour. o <foreign xml:lang="grc">δὲ φθοι̑ς οὔτω <lb/>

              566. Here the priest " consecrates " it, <lb/>
              not to Asclepius, but into his own <lb/>
              wallet. There is a somewhat similar <lb/>
              jest on <foreign xml:lang="grc">καθαγίζειν</foreign> in Lys. 238. It is <lb/>
              strange that Reiske should have sought <lb/>
              to destroy this neat little touch of <lb/>
              humour by substituting for <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἥγιζεν</foreign> the <lb/>
              prosaic <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἥλιζεν</foreign>; and stranger still that <lb/>
              Blaydes should have actually introduced <lb/>
              the latter word into the text of Aristo­ <lb/>
              phanes.</p>

            <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸν θεὸν</foreign> is the ordinary accusative after <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐδεδοίκεις</foreign> : in the answer it becomes the <lb/>
            Independent Accusative, representing <lb/>
            the nominative to <foreign xml:lang="grc">φθάσειέ με</foreign>. For a <lb/>
            very similar instance of this changed <lb/>
            construction see Frogs 41. Here again <lb/>
            contrary to the evidence of all the MSS. <lb/>
            and grammarians, and contrary to the <lb/>
            general usage of Aristophanes, some <lb/>
            critics insist upon intruding into the <lb/>
            text an Attic provincialism, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐδεδοίκης</foreign>.</p>

            this translation is adopted by Brunck. <lb/>
            But it seems to me more probable that <lb/>
            the priest would really tell the patient, <lb/>
            when he brought his offering, that the <lb/>
            God would come for it during the <lb/>

            Arose at once to tackle that tureen.</p>
          <p>WIFE. Unhappy man ! Did you not fear the God ?</p>
          <p>CAR. Indeed I did, lest he should cut in first, <lb/>
            Garlands and all, and capture my tureen. <lb/>
            For so the priest forewarned me he might do. <lb/>
            Then the old lady when my steps she heard <lb/>
            Reached out a stealthy hand; I gave a hiss, <lb/>
            And mouthed it gently like a sacred snake. <lb/>
            Back flies her hand; she draws her coverlets <lb/>
            More tightly round her, and, beneath them, lies <lb/>
            In deadly terror like a frightened cat. <lb/>
            Then of the broth I gobbled down a lot <lb/>
            Till I could eat no more, and then I stopped.</p>
          <p>WIFE. Did not the God approach you ? CAR. Not till later. <lb/>
            And then I did a thing will make you laugh.</p>
          <p>corrections have been suggested, but <lb/>
            all unsatisfactory. I have therefore <lb/>
            substituted <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὑφη̑κε</foreign>, which does not differ <lb/>
            widely from the reading of the MSS. <lb/>
            and gives the required sense. The <lb/>
            Scholiasts say <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὴν χει̑ρα ἐκτείνει κατὰ τη̑ς <lb/>
            χύτρας, ἵνα μηδεὶς αὐτὴν λάβῃ</foreign>, and again <lb/>

            explanations of <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὑφη̑κε</foreign>, but do not go at <lb/>
            all with <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὑφῄρει</foreign>.</p>

            in Epidaurus, the head-quarters of the <lb/>
            worship of Asclepius. Their name <lb/>
            seems to have been derived from their <lb/>
            colour, just as the name <foreign xml:lang="grc">παρω̑ας</foreign> was <lb/>

            Their names connect them with the <lb/>

            he did none of these things\ neither <lb/>

          <p>WIFE. I guess the God was awfully disgusted.</p>
          <p>CAR. No, but Iaso blushed a rosy red <lb/>
            And Panacea turned away her bead <lb/>
            Holding her nose: my wind's not frankincense.</p>
          <p>WIFE. But be himself ? CAR. Observed it not, nor cared.</p>

            Whilst he went round, with calm and quiet tread, <lb/>
            To every patient, scanning each disease. <lb/>
            Then by his side a servant placed a stone <lb/>
            Pestle and mortar; and a medicine chest.</p>
          <p>WIFE. A stone one ? CAR. Hang it, not the medicine cbest.</p>
          <p>WIFE. How saw you this, you villain, when your head, <lb/>

            Neocleides, which it is interesting to <lb/>
            compare with the present. There we <lb/>
            have three ingredients, garlic, verjuice <lb/>
            (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ὀπὸς</foreign>,fig-tree juice), and spurge ; and the <lb/>
            reader will find in the notes to that <lb/>
            passage that all those ingredients were, <lb/>
            and indeed still are, deemed of use in <lb/>
            the treatment of tumours. Here too <lb/>
            we have garlic and verjuice; but for <lb/>
            spurge Asclepius substitutes squill and <lb/>
            vinegar. There are to be three cloves <lb/>
            of Tenian garlic. Tenos is the central <lb/>
            island of the three,-Andros, Tenos, <lb/>
            Myconos,—which look as if they had <lb/>
            formerly been a prolongation of the <lb/>

            by the old grammarians and by geo­ <lb/>
            graphical writers as having been famous <lb/>
            for its garlic ; but I do not know <lb/>
            whether this is to any extent an in­ <lb/>

            This is the plant known as the squill <lb/>

            " very nauseous, intensely bitter, and <lb/>

            exulcerates the skin. This is one of <lb/>
            the few medicines known in the early <lb/>
            ages of Greece which is held in good <lb/>

            mixture more stinging, Asclepius soaks <lb/>
            it (<foreign xml:lang="grc">διέενος</foreign> from <foreign xml:lang="grc">δι</foreign>ĩ<foreign xml:lang="grc">ημι</foreign>) in Sphettian <lb/>
            vinegar. Sphettus was a town in Attica, <lb/>
            probably on the road from Athens <lb/>
            to Sunium (Wordsworth's Athens and <lb/>
            Attica, chap. xxvi), though Leake, on <lb/>
            grounds which seem inadequate, would <lb/>
            place it in a more northerly position. <lb/>
            The grammarians are uncertain whether <lb/>
            a particularly pungent vinegar was <lb/>
            really produced at Sphettus or whether <lb/>
            Aristophanes invented the epithet as <lb/>
            a tribute to the sour and acrimonious <lb/>
            character of the Sphettian townsfolk. <lb/>
            See Athenaeus ii. 76. If the latter is <lb/>
            the true explanation, it is possible that <lb/>
            some topical allusion is also lurking in <lb/>
            the epithet <foreign xml:lang="grc">Τηνίων</foreign>.</p>

            of the best MSS.), could hardly mean <lb/>
            anything but " swearing by the Assem­ <lb/>
            blies"; as if Neocleides were accustomed <lb/>
            to say <foreign xml:lang="grc">μὰ τὰς ἐκκληϭίας, νὴ τὰς ἐκκληϭίας</foreign>,</p><pb n="81"/>

            Of Tenian garlic ; and with these he mingled <lb/>
            Verjuice and squills ; and brayed them up together. <lb/>
            Then drenched the mass with Sphettian vinegar, <lb/>
            And turning up the eyelids of the man <lb/>
            Plastered their inner sides, to make the smart <lb/>
            More painful. Up he springs with yells and roars <lb/>
            In act to flee; then laughed the God, and said, <lb/>
            Nay, sit thou there, beplastered; I'll restrain thee, <lb/>
            Thou reckless swearer,from the Assembly now.</p>
          <p>WIFE.0 what a clever, patriotic God !</p>
          <p>a very unlikely habit, and one which <lb/>
            would not be hindered by his being <lb/>
            made more blind. The Scholiasts give <lb/>
            various explanations, and some of them <lb/>
            seem to imply the participle <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὑπομνύμενον</foreign>, <lb/>
            which was accordingly adopted by Gi­ <lb/>
            rard nearly 400 years ago, and is received <lb/>
            by all recent editors. But the passages <lb/>
            which they cite from Harpocration and <lb/>
            other authorities refer mostly to the <lb/>
            well-known <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὑπωμοία</foreign> of the law-courts <lb/>
            (an application on oath for the adjourn­ <lb/>
            ment of an action on the score of <lb/>
            absence, ill-health, or some other ade­ <lb/>
            quate cause), and have nothing to do <lb/>
            with proceedings in the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐκκληϭία</foreign>. How­ <lb/>
            ever, according to Pollux vii. 56, where <lb/>
            the mover of a resolution or law was <lb/>
            challenged on the ground that his <lb/>
            action was prejudicial to the state, <lb/>
            this challenge was called<foreign xml:lang="grc">ὑπωμοϭία</foreign>, and <lb/>
            the operation of the resolution or law <lb/>
            was suspended until this question was <lb/>
            decided. In Xenophon's narrative of <lb/>
            the proceedings against the generals <lb/>
            after the battle of Arginusae, we are <lb/>
            told that a resolution in the interest of <lb/>
            the generals was moved by Eurypto­ <lb/>
            lemus, and was declared by the Prytanes <lb/>
            to be carried; <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὑπομοϭαμένον δὲ Μενε­ <lb/>
            κλέους</foreign>, it was again put to the vote, <lb/>
            and on this second occasion was de­ <lb/>
            clared to be lost; Hellenics i. 7. 38. <lb/>
            Here the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὑπωμοϭία</foreign> was a challenge on <lb/>
            oath to the ruling of the Prytanes. It <lb/>
            is obvious that an abuse of this practice <lb/>
            of challenging might lead to great <lb/>
            obstruction ; and it is of course possible <lb/>
            that Neocleides had recently made <lb/>
            himself notorious by dilatory pleas of <lb/>
            this kind. Brunck explains the line <lb/>
            " ut meâ opera desinas quaevis promul­ <lb/>
            gata plebiscite, interposito iureiurando, <lb/>
            in concione abrogate " ; and Van Leeu­ <lb/>
            wen "ne pergas, iureiurando interposito, <lb/>
            conciones detinere." This does not <lb/>
            seem altogether satisfactory; and I <lb/>
            suspect that, retaining <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὰς ἐκκληϭίας</foreign>, we <lb/>
            should substitute for <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἴν' ἐπομνύενον</foreign> some <lb/>
            word signifying frequenting or interfer­ <lb/>
            ing with; though nothing so prosaic <lb/>

            And first he felt the patients head, and next <lb/>
            Taking a linen napkin, clean and white, <lb/>
            Wiped both his lids, and all around them, dry. <lb/>
            Then Panacea, with a scarlet cloth <lb/>
            Covered his face and head; then the God clucked, <lb/>

            Two great enormous serpents. WIFE. 0 good heavens !</p>
          <p>CAR. And underneath the scarlet cloth they crept <lb/>
            And licked his eyelids, as it seemed to me; <lb/>
            And, mistress dear, before you could have drunk <lb/>
            Of wine ten goblets, Wealth arose and saw. <lb/>

            self from the throng of adulators, of <lb/>
            whose great affection for himself he <lb/>
            was not even aware until it had been <lb/>
            noised about that Wealth had visited <lb/>
            his house. At the first rumour of his <lb/>
            prosperity they at once make their <lb/>
            appearance (ol <foreign xml:lang="grc">φαινόμενοι</foreign>) like a cloud <lb/>

            which sought to raise a laugh by mere <lb/>
            farcical buffoonery, and not by the <lb/>
            genuine wit and humour of the Comic <lb/>
            Play. This vulgarity Aristophanes <lb/>
            always strove to banish from the Attic <lb/>
            stage; see Clouds 537-44, Wasps 57-66, <lb/>
            Peace 739-50. In the last-mentioned <lb/>
            Comedy he is supposed to have departed <lb/>
            from his own rule by allowing the <lb/>
            servant, during the sacrifice there re­ <lb/>
            presented, to throw grain among the <lb/>
            audience; but I doubt, as Trygaeus in <lb/>
            the play seems to have doubted, if any <lb/>
            was really thrown.</p>
          <p>797. <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐ γὰρ πρεπω̑δες</foreign>] Wealth refuses <lb/>
            to have the <foreign xml:lang="grc">καταχύϭματα</foreign> showered on <lb/>
            the open stage for two reasons; (1) be­ <lb/>
            cause it would not be <foreign xml:lang="grc">πρεπω̑δες</foreign> to himself <lb/>

            The use of the definite article shows <lb/>
            that he does not mean any Poet, but is <lb/>
            referring directly to the Poet whose <lb/>

          <p>Failed to enwreathe me in the market-place ?</p>
          <p>WIFE. Dearest of-men, 0 welcome you and you. <lb/>
            Come now, I'll take these welcoming-gifts and pour them <lb/>
            O'er you, as custom bids. WE. Excuse me, no. <lb/>
            When first I'm entering with my sight restored <lb/>

            Confer a largess rather than receive.</p>
          <p>WIFE. Then won't you take the welcoming-gifts I bring ?</p>
          <p>WE. Aye, by the hearth within, as custom bids. <lb/>
            So too we 'scape the vulgar tricks of farce. <lb/>
            It is not meet, with such a Bard as ours, <lb/>
            To fling a shower of figs and comfits out <lb/>
            Amongst the audience, just to make them laugh.</p>
          <p>WIFE. Well said indeed: for Dexinicus there <lb/>
            Is rising up, to scramble for the figs.</p>
          <p>CAR. How pleasant 'tis to lead a prosperous life,</p>
          <p>worthy of Aristophanes, who has always <lb/>
            set himself against such means of raising <lb/>
            a laugh.</p>
          <p>800. <foreign xml:lang="grc">Δεξίνικος</foreign>] The Scholiasts are not <lb/>
            sure who Dexinicus was, but rather <lb/>
            suspect him to have been a grasping <lb/>
            officer who never let slip any oppor­ <lb/>
            tunity of gaining some advantage for <lb/>
            himself. After this little sally of the <lb/>
            wife they all go into the house, and <lb/>
            the stage is left vacant. Here, in the <lb/>
            earlier Comedies, would have come <lb/>
            a Choral song to pass the time before <lb/>
            the re-entry of Cario. Henceforth he <lb/>
            and Chremylus come out by turns; <lb/>
            they are never on the stage together. <lb/>
            Cario interviews the Good Man and the <lb/>
            Informer; then Chremylus, the Old <lb/>
            Lady and her Young Man ; then Cario, <lb/>
            Hermes; and finally Chremylus the <lb/>
            Priest and the Old Lady again.</p>
          <p>802. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὡς ἡδὺ πράττειν</foreign>] Again some <lb/>
            interval must be taken to have elapsed, <lb/>
            and Cario now comes from the house to <lb/>
            recount the wonderful things that are <lb/>
            taking place within. Everything is <lb/>
            changed by the advent of Wealth. The <lb/>
            bins are overflowing with grain, and <lb/>
            the flagons with wine. The vessels are <lb/>
            heaped full of silver and gold; the <lb/>
            cisterns are running over with oil; the <lb/>
            commonest utensils are changed, some <lb/>
            into silver, some into bronze; whilst as <lb/>
            for golden staters, they are so plentiful <lb/>
            that the very servants use them, as we <lb/>

            idea, though we had done it no wrong <lb/>

            having been the appanage, until now, <lb/>

            and also by way of contrast with the <lb/>

            Homer is a frequent epithet of both <lb/>
            blood and wine, does not really mean <lb/>
            black, but blood-red. " The King sits in <lb/>
            Dumferling toune, Drinking the bluid­ <lb/>

          <p>And that, expending nothing of one's own. <lb/>
            Into this house a heap of golden joys <lb/>
            Has hurled itself though nothing wrong we've done. <lb/>
            Truly a sweet and pleasant thing is wealth. <lb/>
            With good white barley is our garner filled <lb/>
            And all our casks with red and fragrant wine. <lb/>
            And every vessel in the house is crammed <lb/>
            With gold and silver, wonderful to see. <lb/>
            The tank overflows with oil; the oil-flasks teem <lb/>
            With precious unguents; and the loft with figs. <lb/>
            And every cruet, pitcher, pannikin, <lb/>
            Is turned to bronze; the mouldy trencherlets <lb/>
            That held the fish are all of silver now. <lb/>
            Our lantern, all at once, is ivory-framed. <lb/>
            And we the servants, play at odd-or-even <lb/>

            fications; but in this passage it no doubt <lb/>

          <p>816. <foreign xml:lang="grc">στατη̑ρσι</foreign>] These were not Athe­ <lb/>
            nian coins; but gold staters were issued <lb/>
            by many states, such as Lydia, Cyzicus, <lb/>
            and Lampsacus, and were frequently <lb/>
            found in Athens. Their value varied, <lb/>
            but possibly we should not be far wrong <lb/>
            in estimating their average value to be <lb/>
            that of an English guinea. Though not <lb/>
            uncommon in Athens, they had hitherto <lb/>
            been extremely uncommon in the house­ <lb/>
            hold of Chremylus. But now they are <lb/>
            so abundant that the very servants play <lb/>
            even or odd with them; a boyish game, <lb/>
            where one holds out his closed hand, <lb/>
            and the other guesses whether the <lb/>
            articles it contains are of an even or <lb/>
            odd number. Several references to the <lb/>
            game are collected by Spanheim and <lb/>
            others; such as Plato, Lysis, chap. 3 <lb/>
            (206 E) <foreign xml:lang="grc">οἱ παι̑δες του̑ ἀποδυτηρίου ἐνγωνία̣ <lb/>

              of amenities between two courtesans <lb/>
              (Athenaeus xiii. 41), one of whom was <lb/>
              supposed to be afflicted with the stone, <lb/>
              and the other with an incapacity to <lb/>
              resist the calls of nature.</p>
          <p>What, have you got the stone, my girl? <lb/>
            Gnathaena once to Mania cried. <lb/>
            And if I had, I'd give it tou, <lb/>
            To cleanse yourself, the girl replied.</p>
          <p>819. <foreign xml:lang="grc">βουθυτει̑</foreign>] Some think that the <lb/>
            first syllable of this word has merely <lb/>
            the augmentative force which it fre­ <lb/>
            quently possesses in compounds, as in <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">βουλιμια̢̑ι</foreign>nfra 873. But it is more <lb/>
            probable that <foreign xml:lang="grc">βουθυτει̑ν</foreign> originally meant <lb/>
            strictly to sacrifice an ox, and then <lb/>
            became applicable to any sacrifice, <lb/>
            whatever the victim. See Birds 1232. <lb/>
            So also, observes Spanheim, <foreign xml:lang="grc">βουκόλοι</foreign> is <lb/>
            the ordinary designation of shepherds. <lb/>
            Chremylus, we are told, wore a wreath <lb/>
            when in the act of sacrificing; and <lb/>
            this was the universal custom. "To <lb/>
            Xenophon, when he was sacrificing," <lb/>
            says Aelian, V. H. iii. 3, "came one <lb/>
            from Mantineia, announcing that his <lb/>
            son Gryllus had fallen in the battle. <lb/>
            Xenophon laid aside his wreath, but <lb/>
            went on with the sacrifice. But when <lb/>
            the messenger added that he died in <lb/>
            the hour of victory [or, as Diogenes <lb/>

          <p>G. M. Aye, Aye. CAR. What want you now ? G. M. I am come to thank <lb/>
            The God: great blessings hath he wrought for me. <lb/>
            For I, inheriting a fair estate, <lb/>

            Esteeming that the wisest thing to do.</p>

            of the errors of their fellow citizens. <lb/>
            We saw them at work in the first <lb/>
            extant Comedy of Aristophanes ; we <lb/>

            business of yours, you are hated: that is, <lb/>
            do things worthy of hatred. Si in its <lb/>
            quae nihil ad te attinent, odium tibi <lb/>
            concilias, as Bergler translates it, and <lb/>
            his translation is adopted by Brunck. <lb/>
            And the Scholiasts say <foreign xml:lang="grc">εἰ διὰ τῶν πραγ­ <lb/>

            probable, and the Informer's answer <lb/>
            makes it almost a certainty, that a line <lb/>
            has dropped out, a line recording the <lb/>
            conduct which removed the Informer <lb/>
            from the ranks of the <foreign xml:lang="grc">χρηστοὶ</foreign>, and made <lb/>
            him an object of universal hatred. The <lb/>
            translation gives the sense required <lb/>
            rather than the strict meaning of the <lb/>
            Greek as it stands. The words <foreign xml:lang="grc">προσῆκον <lb/>
            μηδὲν</foreign> are used absolutely.</p>
          <p>912. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὦ κέπφε</foreign>] There is an excellent <lb/>
            description of the <foreign xml:lang="grc">κέπφος</foreign> in the para­ <lb/>
            phrase of " Dionysius on Birds " ii. 10. <lb/>
            “There is another bird," writes the <lb/>
            paraphrast, " which the fishers call the <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">κέπφος</foreign> by reason of its lightness, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐκ τῆς <lb/>
            κουφότητος</foreign>, for it runs with its feet on <lb/>
            the top of the waves. And it is a sign <lb/>
            of good-luck to the fishers, for the <lb/>
            birds spend their time where there are <lb/>
            the largest shoals of fish. And more <lb/>
            especially they accompany the tunnies, <lb/>
            to eat the scraps left floating of the <lb/>
            little fishes which they (the tunnies) <lb/>
            tear to pieces with their teeth. So <lb/>
            again they follow the dolphins to feed <lb/>
            on the blood of the fishes which the <lb/>
            dolphins kill. Moreover they eat the <lb/>
            foam of the sea. And no man can easily <lb/>
            catch the <foreign xml:lang="grc">κέπφοι</foreign> asleep or idle, either <lb/>
            on land or at sea, for they are always <lb/>
            either hunting or flying." This is so <lb/>
            unmistakable a description of the <lb/>
            Stormy Petrel (Thalassidroma Pelagica, <lb/>
            Gould 448) which derives its name from <lb/>
            walking on the water, like Saint Peter, <lb/>
            that the identity of the two birds is <lb/>
            universally admitted. The notion that <lb/>
            the Petrel eats the foam of the sea is <lb/>
            mentioned by Aristotle (N. H. ix. 35) <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">οἁ δὲ κέπφοι ἁλίσκονται τῷ ἀφρῷ· κάπτουσι</foreign> <lb/>

            puns, rather smartly, on the words <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἅφρων</foreign>, foolish, and <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀφρὸς</foreign>, foam ; <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὄρνεον <lb/>

            top of the surge is a fact; but its food <lb/>
            is not the sea-foam itself, but the spawn <lb/>
            and the tiny mollusca within it. As <lb/>
            the Petrel is now far from being con­ <lb/>

            various treatises. " Is the law useful ? <lb/>

            is it to be executed without an Informer ? <lb/>

            an empty name. Each in his sphere, <lb/>
            they co-operate towards the same end. <lb/>
            Shall the judge then be held in honour <lb/>
            and the Informer, without whom he is <lb/>
            nothing, be vilified and contemned?" <lb/>

            Judicial Establishments, chap. viii.Tit. 6. <lb/>
            And again, " The execution of the law <lb/>
            cannot be enforced, unless the violator <lb/>
            of it be denounced; the assistance of <lb/>
            the Informer is therefore altogether as <lb/>
            necessary and as meritorious as that of <lb/>
            the Judge." Rationale of Reward, i. 13. <lb/>
            And in his Principles of Penal Law, ii. <lb/>
            3. (4) he suggests that a law should <lb/>
            be passed for the encouragement of <lb/>
            Informers, and that its preamble should <lb/>
            contain the following statement. " It is <lb/>
            the artifice of bad men to seek to draw <lb/>
            contempt upon them who by executing <lb/>
            the laws would be a check upon their <lb/>
            misdeeds. If the law is just, as it ought <lb/>

            Or have we altogether missed the way ?</p>
          <p>CHOR. No, you have really reached his very door, <lb/>
            You dear young girl; for girl-like is your speech.</p>
          <p>O. L. O, then, I'll summon one of those within.</p>

            So tell me freely what has brought you here.</p>

            My lifers been not worth living; all through him.</p>
          <p>CH. What, were you too a she-informer then <lb/>
            Amongst the women ? O. L. No indeed, not I.</p>
          <p>CH. Or, not elected, sat you judging-wine ?</p>
          <p>I think, be doubted that this is a direct <lb/>
            reference to the Informer who has just <lb/>
            left the stage; and some have therefore <lb/>
            supposed that Chremylus and not Cario <lb/>
            must have been the interlocutor in the <lb/>
            preceding scene. But this is not <lb/>
            a necessary inference. Attic Comedy <lb/>
            did not trouble itself about inoon­ <lb/>
            sistencies and probabilities. It did not <lb/>
            expect a spectator to say How did <lb/>
            Chremylus know anything about the <foreign xml:lang="grc">συκο­ <lb/>
            φάντης</foreign> ? The audience knew all about <lb/>
            him, and that was enough.</p>
          <p>972. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐν τῷ γράμματι</foreign>] When all the ten <lb/>
            Courts were sitting, each of the ten <lb/>
            dicastic sections would draw at the <lb/>
            balloting booths the letter of the <lb/>
            Court-house in which it was that day <lb/>
            to Bit. But after the downfall of the <lb/>
            Empire there would rarely be sufficient <lb/>
            business to occupy all the Courts, and <lb/>
            therefore some of the sections would <lb/>
            draw blanks, and so would that day <lb/>
            hold no sitting, and draw no pay. See <lb/>
            the Commentary on Eccl. 681-3, and <lb/>
            on 277 supra. But some of the poorer <lb/>
            citizens would now, as at the date of <lb/>
            the Wasps (see lines 304-12 of that <pb n="110"/>

              play), depend for their meals on their <lb/>
              dicastic pay, and many, it appears, <lb/>
              were the fraudulent devices to which <lb/>
              they would resort to obtain it. One <lb/>
              would attempt to sit in a dicastic <lb/>
              section with which he was not really <lb/>
              empanelled; that is the meaning of <lb/>
              the present passage. Another would <lb/>
              contrive to enter his name in more <lb/>
              than one list, so as to diminish the <lb/>
              chance of a blank; that is the meaning <lb/>
              of 1166, 1167 infra. Frauds of this kind, <lb/>

            And what he wanted, I in turn supplied.</p>
          <p>CH. What were the things he asked you to supply ?</p>
          <p>O. L. Not many: so prodigious the respect <lb/>
            In which he held me. 'Twould be twenty drachmas <lb/>
            To buy a cloke and, maybe, eight for shoes; <lb/>
            Then for his sisters he would want a gown, <lb/>
            And just one mantle for his mothers use, <lb/>
            And twice twelve bushels of good wheat perchance.</p>
          <p>CH. Not many truly were the gifts he asked ! <lb/>
            'Tis plain he held you in immense respect.</p>
          <p>O. L. And these he wanted not for greed, he swore, <lb/>
            But for lovers sake, that when my robe he wore, <lb/>
            He might, by that, remember me the more.</p>

            Μιλήσιοι</foreign>,” Athenaeus xii. 26. The line <lb/>
            was originally composed by Anacreon, <lb/>
            and was afterwards delivered by the <lb/>
            oracle at Branchidae as a response to <lb/>
            the Carian delegates who inquired <lb/>
            whether they should accept the alli­ <lb/>
            ance of the Milesians against King <lb/>
            Dareius. Such is the account given by <lb/>
            the Scholiast here, and by the Paroemio­ <lb/>
            graphers (Bodleian 776, Zenobius v. 80, <lb/>
            Gaisford pp. 95, 368). Phrases of this <lb/>
            kind signify that the state of things to <lb/>
            which they refer exists no longer; like <lb/>
            Virgil's fuit Ilium, " Ilium is a thing <lb/>
            of the past"; and as, in Measure for <lb/>
            Measure, Isabella, abandoning all hope <lb/>
            of saving her brother's life, exclaims <lb/>
            "I had a brother then," meaning that <lb/>
            she has one no longer. So Cicero, <lb/>
            returning from the execution of Cati­ <lb/>
            line's accomplices, announced their <lb/>
            fate by the single word Vixerunt (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἔζησαντ</foreign> <lb/>
            Plutarch, Cic. 22); and so Corbulo, <lb/>
            recalled by his Master's jealousy from <lb/>
            the scene of his anticipated triumphs, <lb/>
            merely remarked <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὦ μακάριοι οἱ πάκαι <lb/>

            the right number. In the Eutby­ <lb/>

            means sure of their meaning. But I <lb/>
            think that the speaker is referring to <lb/>
            the Youth's last remark that he will <lb/>
            permit Chremylus to carry her off. That <lb/>
            act therefore there is one who will per­ <lb/>

            who is it will permit that ? who is <lb/>
            o <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπιτρέψων</foreign> there ? Dobree refers to <lb/>
            a line of Machon (Atbenaeus xiii. chap. <lb/>
            43, p. 580 D), <foreign xml:lang="grc">τίς</foreign> 6' <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὁ ἐπιτρέψων ἐστί σοι</foreign> ; <lb/>
            And possibly <foreign xml:lang="grc">τίς</foreign> o <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπιτρέψων</foreign> was a legal <lb/>
            or technical formula of some sort. <lb/>

            the reverse of her meaning. It is his <lb/>
            desertion of her, and not his keeping <lb/>
            company with her, which requires the <lb/>
            permission that it will not obtain. Nor <lb/>

            to detach it from its rock in any direc­ <lb/>

            or 960 times its own weight, whilst to <lb/>

            After this line they all go into the <lb/>

            porter's lodge on the other. And hence <lb/>
            it was that in Wasps 179 the donkey is <lb/>

            Its meaning may be illustrated from <lb/>

            meaning; for on his lips it signifies <lb/>
            The herald of this bad news shall have <lb/>

            lonius Rhodius in his first book, and is <lb/>
            a favourite topic of the poets. And it <lb/>
            was believed that after the other Argo­ <lb/>

            Heracles still vainly seeking and call­ <lb/>

            ders was a rustic amusement at the <lb/>
            Attic Dionysia. The player hopped on <lb/>
            the top of an inflated bladder (like our <lb/>

          <p>1189. <foreign xml:lang="grc">πάρεστιν ἐνθάδε</foreign>] The Scholiasts <lb/>
            and Commentators understand Chremy­ <lb/>
            lus to mean that Wealth himself is the <lb/>
            real Z<foreign xml:lang="grc">εὺς Σωτήρ</foreign>; an interpretation which <lb/>
            to my mind is destructive of the wit, <lb/>
            and inconsistent with the language, of <lb/>
            the passage. Chremylus merely observes <lb/>
            that Z<foreign xml:lang="grc">εὺς σωτὴρ</foreign>, not the real Z<foreign xml:lang="grc">εὺς Σωτὴρ</foreign> <lb/>
            is within ; and he adds that he came of <lb/>
            his own spontaneous motion, which was <lb/>
            not. the case with Wealth; the Priest <lb/>
            could not have rejoiced at the good <lb/>
            tidings had he received no tidings at <lb/>
            all ; and Chremylus, proceeding to <lb/>
            speak of Wealth, does not employ the <lb/>
            pronoun <foreign xml:lang="grc">αὐτὸν</foreign> as if he were already the <lb/>
            subject of their conversation, but intro­ <lb/>
            duces him as <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸν Πλοῦτον</foreign>. On the other <lb/>
            hand, we have already seen Hermes <lb/>
            deserting the Olympian Court for the <lb/>
            superior attractions of Wealth; we have <lb/>
            already heard (supra 587) of Zeus's <lb/>
            devotion to Wealth, and we know that <lb/>
            he is now starving. And in my judge­ <lb/>
            ment Chremylus means that the great <lb/>
            Zeus himself has followed the example <lb/>
            of Hermes; so that the Priest, thinking <lb/>
            to desert his God for the purpose of <lb/>
            entering into the service of Wealth, <lb/>
            finds that his God has been beforehand <lb/>
            with him, and is already himself snugly <lb/>
            ensconced within.</p>
          <p>1191. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀλλὰ περίμενε</foreign>] These words are <lb/>
            spoken parenthetically, <foreign xml:lang="grc">διὰ μέσου</foreign> as the <lb/>
            Scholiast says. At the mere mention of <lb/>
            an impending installation service, the <lb/>
            Priest manifests such eagerness and <lb/>
            excitement, that Chremylus has for the <lb/>
            moment to restrain his impetuosity. <lb/>
            From this point to the close of the play <lb/>
            Chremylus is arranging a great religious <lb/>
            procession for the purpose of escorting <lb/>
            Wealth in triumph to his proper home <lb/>

          <p>was not much wealth in the Treasury <lb/>
            now, owing to the cessation of the tribute <lb/>
            paid by the allies, and to the enormous <lb/>
            expenditure occasioned by the adhesion <lb/>

            Scholiast here says that it was the <lb/>
            Temple of Athene Polias, that is, the <lb/>
            Erectheium ; <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὀπίσω τοῦ νεὼ τη̑ς καλουμένης <lb/>

            most Scholars are in favour of the <lb/>
            Parthenon. Boeckh's argument for this <lb/>
            view (Public Economy iii. 20) may be <lb/>
            disregarded, being based on the strange <lb/>
            assumption that there was no Erec­ <lb/>

            408 B.C., an assumption which he <lb/>

            an Opisthodomus in the existing ruins <lb/>
            of the Erectheium ; whereas the Opis­ <lb/>
            thodomus of the Parthenon is still <lb/>

          <p>THE Plutus, though the last in point of date, is placed first in the <lb/>
            selection of Aristophanic Comedies which has come down to our time. <lb/>
            And either for that reason, or because it is really the play most suitable <lb/>
            for the commencement of a study of the poet's works, it is found in <lb/>
            many more MSS. than any other of these plays. In his very valuable <lb/>
            articles on "the MSS. of Aristophanes " (in the first volume of " Classical <lb/>
            Philology") Professor John Williams White reckons it to be contained <lb/>
            in no less than 148 MSS. Many of these, I believe, have never been <lb/>
            collated and are probably not worthy of collation. In the following <lb/>
            Table are included all those collated by Velsen, Brunck, and other critics, <lb/>
            down to and including Dr. Blaydes.</p>
          <p>R. The Ravenna MS.</p>
          <p>V. The first Venetian (No. 474, St. Mark's Library, Venice).</p>
          <p>P. The first Parisian (No. 2712, National Library, Paris).</p>
          <p>U. The Vaticano-Urbinas (No. 141, Urbino).</p>
          <p>(These four MSS. have been collated by Velsen. In the case of R. and <lb/>
            V., I have always carefully verified his collations with the photogravures <lb/>
            of those MSS.)</p>
          <p>P2. The third Parisian (No. 2717).</p>
          <p>P3- The fourth Parisian (C. B. 2).</p>
          <p>P5- Brunck's own MS.</p>
          <p>(Brunck's edition is founded on a collation of P. P2. P3. P5. In the <lb/>
            Appendix to the Frogs, I mentioned that P5. had come into the possession <lb/>
             <pb n="139"/>
            of Richard Heber, but I could not trace it further. Professor White <lb/>
            tells us that it is now in the Library of Trinity College, Cambridge.)</p><figure type="illustration">

          <p>The first seventeen editions of Aristophanes enumerated, as being in <lb/>
            my possession, at the commencement of the Appendix to the Frogs all <lb/>
            contain the Plutus. After Invernizzi's I have the following editions of <lb/>
            the play.</p>
          <p>(18) Porson's Plutus. Cambridge 1820 (edited, after his death, by <lb/>
            Dobree).</p><pb n="141"/>
            
          <p>(19) Bothers first edition. Leipsic, 1828.</p>
          <p>(20) Bekker. London, 1829.</p>
          <p>(21) Cookesley's Plutus. London, 1834 (Text from an earlier edition <lb/>
            of Dindorf).</p>
          <p>(22) Dindorf. Oxford, 1835.</p>
          <p>(23) Bothers second edition. Leipsic, 1845.</p>
          <p>(24) Bergk. Leipsic, 1857 (Reprinted 1888).</p>
          <p>(25) Meineke. Leipsic, 1860.</p>
          <p>(26) Holden. London, 1868.</p>
          <p>(27) Yelsen's Plutus. Leipsic, 1881.</p>
          <p>(28) Green's Plutus. Cambridge, 1886.</p>
          <p>(29) Blaydes. Halle, 1886.</p>
          <p>(30) Hall and Geldart. Oxford, 1900.</p>
          <p>(31) Van Leeuwen. Leyden, 1904.</p>
          <p>We should have expected an edition of the Plutus, commenced by <lb/>
            Person and finished by Dobree, to be of inestimable value. But that is <lb/>
            not the case. Person would not have published the work in its present <lb/>
            state. The notes contain little beyond desultory collations of unimportant <lb/>
            MSS.; and there are few plays of Aristophanes to which these two great <lb/>
            scholars have not made contributions of greater value than they have to <lb/>
            the Plutus.</p>
          <p>The Greek scholia are more abundant on this play than on any other; <lb/>
            and so are the Latin commentaries of modern scholars. So early as 1549, <lb/>
            a good edition of the Plutus, as a separate play, was published in Paris <lb/>
            by C. Girard with excellent explanatory notes which are incorporated in <lb/>
            the editions of Portus and Bekker. The latter edition also contains the <lb/>
            notes of Hemsterhuys (as he is called in England, though his name was <lb/>
            really spelt Hemsterhuis) from his edition published in 1744 of the Plutus <lb/>
            with the Greek scholia. His annotations on the Scholia are almost as valu­ <lb/>
            able as those on the play itself. Fischer's explanatory notes, travelling <lb/>
            with great diligence over every portion of the text, were published in 1804 <lb/>
            by Kuinoel. These too are comprised in Bekker's edition. In 1867 an <lb/>
             <pb n="142"/>
            edition of the play was published at Amsterdam by Kappeyne van de <lb/>
            Coppello which I have not seen, but which seems to be sufficiently discussed <lb/>
            in Bamberg's Exercitationes Criticae in Aristophanis Plutum, Berlin, 1869. <lb/>
            It is perhaps of interest to add that an edition of the Clouds and Plutus <lb/>
            was published in 1528 by Philip Melanchthon.</p>

            reading Bentley suggested <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀποκρινόμενος</foreign>. <lb/>
            He says “Patet ex verso 19 et 24 <lb/>
            Chremylum a servo interrogatum nihil <lb/>
            respondisse. Plutum vero nondum <lb/>
            fuisse interrogatum versus 60 ostendit <lb/>
            et 52.”—Epist. ad Kuster. And <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀποκρινό­ <lb/>
            μενος</foreign> is adopted by Tyrwhitt, Person, <lb/>
            Brunck, Meineke, Holden, Velsen, <lb/>
            Blaydes, and Van Leeuwen. But I <lb/>
            can see no reason for concluding that <lb/>
            Chremylus has not endeavoured to enter <lb/>
            into conversation with the stranger <lb/>
            before the commencement of the play; <lb/>
            and the peremptory manner in which <lb/>
            Cario addresses him in line 56 seems <lb/>
            to imply that he had already shown <lb/>
            some reluctance to discuss his affairs. <lb/>
            Bentley, of course, was unaware of R.'s <lb/>
            reading.</p>

            a suggestion of Kappeyne van de <lb/>

            Chremylus, and gives them to Cario. <lb/>
            But Velsen, though an invaluable col­ <lb/>

            they are given by the MSS. and the <lb/>

          <p>98. <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐχ έόρακά πω χρόνου</foreign> Tyrwhitt, <lb/>
            Bekker, Dindorf, Bergk, and Hall and <lb/>
            Geldart. And except that R. has <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἑώρακα</foreign>, <lb/>
            contra metrum (which Invernizzi <lb/>
            follows), this is the reading of R. But <lb/>
            P. U. and the great majority of the <lb/>
            MSS. have ovx <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἑώρακα χρόνου</foreign>, and this is <lb/>
            the reading of all editions before Inver­ <lb/>
            nizzi. V. and a few other MSS. agree <lb/>
            with R., except that for <foreign xml:lang="grc">πω</foreign> they have <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">που</foreign>. Dawes suggested the change of <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">που</foreign> into <foreign xml:lang="grc">πω</foreign>, not knowing that the latter <lb/>
            was to be found in any MS.: and pro­ <lb/>
            posed ovx <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἑώρων πω</foreign> (or <foreign xml:lang="grc">τοῦ</foreign>) <foreign xml:lang="grc">χρόνου</foreign>, but <lb/>
            discarded these suggestions for <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐκ ὄπωπ᾿ <lb/>
            ἐγὼ χρόνου</foreign>, a reading which, as Brunck <lb/>
            truly observed, departs too widely from <lb/>
            the MSS. Bergk however thought that <lb/>
            Dawes might be right as regards the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐγὼ</foreign>, <lb/>
            and <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐγὼ</foreign> is substituted for <foreign xml:lang="grc">πω</foreign> by Mei­ <lb/>
            neke, Holden, Velsen, Blaydes, and Van <lb/>
            Leeuwen. Brunck himself suggested <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐχ ἑ ώρων διὰ χρόνου</foreign>, and <foreign xml:lang="grc">διὰ χρόνου</foreign> is <lb/>
            read by Green. Meanwhile Tyrwhitt <lb/>
            pointed out that for <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἑώρακα</foreign> we should <lb/>
            read <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἑόρακα</foreign>, and <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἑόρακα</foreign> was adopted by <lb/>
            Person, Bekker, and all subsequent <lb/>
            editors. See the Appendices to Birds <lb/>
            1573 and Thesm. 32. For <foreign xml:lang="grc">πω</foreign> Person <lb/>
            suggested, though he did not read, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀπὸ</foreign>, <lb/>
            referring to Birds 920 and 1515, but in <lb/>
            both those passages there is a reference, <lb/>
            which is wanting here, to the commence­ <lb/>
            ment of the period, <foreign xml:lang="grc">πω</foreign> seems quite <lb/>
            right, since Plutus is not now seeing <lb/>

            MS., and the third by one very insigni- <lb/>

            Holden transfers them accordingly. <lb/>
            The Scholiast's gloss on <foreign xml:lang="grc">δοῦλος γεγένημαι</foreign> <lb/>
            is <foreign xml:lang="grc">πρότερον ὢν ἐλεύθερος</foreign>, meaning, quite <lb/>
            rightly, that the expression " becoming a <lb/>
            slave " implies that Cario was not a <foreign xml:lang="grc">δοῦλος <lb/>
            οἰκογενὴς</foreign>, but had once been a freeman. <lb/>
            But Heimreich, mistaking these words <lb/>
            for a quotation (which they obviously <lb/>
            are not), proposed to substitute them <lb/>
            for <foreign xml:lang="grc">διὰ τὸ μὴ πλουτεῖν ἴσως</foreign>, a strange <lb/>
            notion (for the Scholiast means that <lb/>
            they were implied, and therefore need <lb/>
            not be expressed), but not too strange <lb/>
            to be adopted by both Velsen and Van <lb/>

            fact is that some MSS. of the Etym. M. <lb/>

            matters were in this unsatisfactory state <lb/>
            Bentley restored the metre by proposing <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὺνθρώποις ὰγοθὸν</foreign> (or <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀγαθὰ</foreign>) <foreign xml:lang="grc">πορίζομεν. <lb/>

            ever the first to see that <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀγαθὸν</foreign> belongs <lb/>
            to line 462, and to reconstruct the <lb/>
            passage in accordance with what is now <lb/>
            found to be the reading of the best <lb/>
            MSS. And it is surprising that after <lb/>
             <pb n="152"/>
            the true reading is known, Velsen <lb/>
            should hark back to Bentley's stopgap, <lb/>

            fessing still to follow Bentley, he, by <lb/>

            but that of O3. <foreign xml:lang="grc">τί δίδ</foreign>’ <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἂν ποθ</foreign>’ which, as <lb/>

            seems by no means improbable, and is <lb/>
            adopted by Van Leeuwen. Bamberg <lb/>

            that he would leave the MS. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ποτ</foreign>’ un­ <lb/>
            changed ; this seems less probable, but <lb/>
            is adopted by Holden and Velsen. The <lb/>

            the possible exception of Plato, far <lb/>
            preferred the general Hellenic forms to <lb/>
            their own native provincialisms. And <lb/>
            this was especially the case with the <lb/>

            observations point strongly to <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὑπομνύ­ <lb/>
            μενον</foreign>, which was adopted by Girard <lb/>
            nearly 400 years ago. His note is as <lb/>
            follows " Significat hoc verbum aliquo <lb/>
            praetextu, puta peregrinationis vel <lb/>

            mend it here; and it is accordingly <lb/>
            adopted by Blaydes and Van Leeuwen. <lb/>
            This is very possibly right; but all the <lb/>
            numerous MSS. of this play have a in <lb/>
            the penultimate syllable, and both forms <lb/>

            It seems far more probable that <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὑπαντη̑­ <lb/>

            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀπαντη̑σαι</foreign>, than vice versa. After this <lb/>

            XOPOY ; R. as part of the original text <lb/>
            V. as an afterthought. And so all <lb/>
            editions before Kuster and one or two <lb/>
            since. Brunck has <foreign xml:lang="grc">λείπει κομμάτιον του̑ <lb/>

            XOPOY simply, whilst Velsen writes <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὂρχημα χορου̑</foreign>. But most editors have <lb/>
            followed Kuster in omitting the words <lb/>
            altogether; and as it seems certain <lb/>
            that there was no Choral song here, and <lb/>
            that therefore nothing has dropped out <lb/>
            of the text, this seems the right course. <lb/>
            Between the other scenes the best MSS. <lb/>
            have nothing of this sort; and the <lb/>
            editors insert or omit the notice there <lb/>
            as they do here.</p>

            But to say that Dexinicus wished to get <lb/>
            a share of the figs would not impute to <lb/>
            him any special greed; that would be <lb/>
            the wish of the spectators at large; <lb/>
            Dexinicus is described as wishing to get <lb/>
            the figs generally. After this line the <lb/>
            MSS. make no mention of any choral <lb/>
            intervention except that C1. and a cor­ <lb/>
            rector of R. write Xopov. But Aldus <lb/>
            and all editions (except Fracini and <lb/>
            Gelenius) before Portus have <foreign xml:lang="grc">Χορυ̑</foreign> in <lb/>
            the margin; whilst Fracini, Gelenius, <lb/>
            Portus, the editions called Scaliger's and <lb/>
            Faber's, and Person, place it between <lb/>
            lines 801 and 802. Kuster omitted it, <lb/>
            and of more recent editors some insert, <lb/>
            but most omit it. Brunck and Velsen <lb/>
            read as they did after line 770 supra.</p>
          <p>805 a. <foreign xml:lang="grc">οῠτω τὸ πλουτεΐν</foreign> K.T.X. This <lb/>
            line is found in the MSS. but was <lb/>
            adjudged to be spurious by Bentley, <lb/>
            and is omitted or bracketed by Brunck <lb/>
            and most recent editors. In U. P2. P3. <lb/>
            P5. the letters yv or <foreign xml:lang="grc">γνω</foreign> are prefixed. <lb/>
            Brunck considered, and I think rightly, <lb/>
            that the line was originally written in <lb/>
            the margin as a parallel passage to line <lb/>
            802; and having access to the last <lb/>
            three MSS. mentioned, he observed that <lb/>
            the copyist had brought in not merely <lb/>
            the line, but also its title, <foreign xml:lang="grc">γνώμη</foreign>. Van <lb/>
            Leeuwen places it between lines 818 <lb/>
            and 819, which is certainly a more <lb/>
            suitable position. The last word is <lb/>
            given as <foreign xml:lang="grc">δὴ</foreign> by R. V. Invernizzi and most <lb/>
            of the more recent editors ; as <foreign xml:lang="grc">τι</foreign> by P. U. <lb/>

            the first syllable of <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἰπνὸς</foreign> been long, this <lb/>
            would have been quite right; but un­ <lb/>
            fortunately it is short. Bentley there­ <lb/>
            fore, referring to Pollux (x. 155) who <lb/>
            writes '<foreign xml:lang="grc">Αριστοφάνης έν Πλούτῳ εἰπὸν τὴν <lb/>
            μυάγραν καλε</foreign>ȋ, proposed to read <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἶπος</foreign> here, <lb/>
            and this is strongly supported by Brunck <lb/>
            who inserts <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἶπος</foreign> in the text, and is <lb/>
            followed by Bothe and Velsen. On the <lb/>
            other hand Dawes, finding the line <lb/>
            quoted by Athenaeus (vi. chap. 16) as <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ό δ' ἰπνὸς γέγονεν</foreign>, proposed to read <foreign xml:lang="grc">ό</foreign> S' <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἰπνὸς γέγον'ήμΐν</foreign>. This proposal was <lb/>
            vigorously attacked by Brunck who <lb/>
            says " Virum ingeniosum abripiebat <lb/>
            livor et Bentleii laudum obtrectatio." <lb/>
            It would have been very difficult to <lb/>
            decide between the proposals of Bentley <lb/>
            and Dawes on their own merits. But <lb/>
            when the two great Aristophanic MSS. <lb/>
            in the libraries of Ravenna and Venice <lb/>
            were brought to light, they were both <lb/>
            found to have <foreign xml:lang="grc">ό δ' ίπνὸς γέγον' ὴμ</foreign>ȋ<foreign xml:lang="grc">ν</foreign>, and <lb/>
            the question was finally set at rest.</p>
          <p>824. KAP. The speaker who carries <lb/>
            on the conversation with the Good Man <lb/>
            is said to be Cario (under his own name, <lb/>
            or as <foreign xml:lang="grc">οἰκέτηςο</foreign>r <foreign xml:lang="grc">θεράπων</foreign>) by R. V. U. <lb/>

            the editions from Brunck to Bothe's <lb/>
            second (inclusive) give his part to <lb/>
            Chremylus, and this change is strongly <lb/>
            recommended by Hemsterhuys. But <lb/>
             <pb n="160"/>
            the preceding speech was certainly <lb/>
            spoken by Cario, and there is no sign of <lb/>
            his having left the stage, or of Chremy­ <lb/>

            trimeter. In the translation there <lb/>
            have to be only ten repetitions. Bothe <lb/>
            (in the text) has only eight, but all <lb/>
            other printed editions give the full <lb/>
            twelve. V. has fifteen. As to the <lb/>
            accent the MSS. give none, and it <lb/>
            seems rather absurd to place an accent <lb/>
            on a sniff. But it is accented in all <lb/>
            the editions. Aldus accented it <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὖὗ</foreign> <lb/>

            chlin, who had turned this Comedy into <lb/>

            quid agat ? nam horum te testem mihi <lb/>

            cannot bring myself to think that he <lb/>
            is right in making this alteration. The <lb/>
            appeal <foreign xml:lang="grc">μαρτὺρομαι</foreign> or <foreign xml:lang="grc">ταυ̑τ ἐγὼ μαρτύρομαι</foreign> <lb/>
            is frequently found in these comedies, <lb/>
            and in no single instance is it prefaced <lb/>
            by any preliminary remarks to the <lb/>
            person or persons addressed. It is <lb/>
            always in the nature of an ejaculation, <lb/>
            wrung from the speaker by the stress <lb/>
            of the moment. See Clouds 1297, <lb/>
            Wasps, 1436 Frogs 528, &amp;c. It seems <lb/>
            to me that the Informer, stripped of <lb/>
            his cloke and shoes says first to Cario <lb/>
            Do you see what you are doing? and <lb/>
            then, as Cario pays no attention, appeals <lb/>

            early editions. I regret that his masterly <lb/>
            discussion of the passage (in his Epistle <lb/>
            to Kuster) is too long to be reproduced <lb/>
            here. He refers to Plautus, Asinaria <lb/>
            iii. 3. 103 Die igitur me anaticulam, <lb/>
            columbulam, &amp;c., where no doubt in <lb/>
            the ’<foreign xml:lang="grc">Οναγὸς</foreign> of Demophilus, which <lb/>
            Plautus is adapting, the words were, <lb/>
            as here, <foreign xml:lang="grc">νηττάριον</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">φάττιον</foreign>. Faber <lb/>
            had already (at Lucret. p. 497) suggested <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">νησσάριον</foreign> for <foreign xml:lang="grc">νιτάριον</foreign>. Bentley's emenda­ <lb/>
            tion is adopted by Brunck, Invernizzi, <lb/>
            Bekker, Dindorf, and Hall and Geldart, <lb/>
            and would have been followed by all <lb/>
            editors, were it not for a doubt whether <lb/>
            a tribrach, followed by an anapaest, is <lb/>
            admissible in a Comic senarius. But <lb/>
            although such a conjunction is rare, it <lb/>
            is by no means unknown in Aristo- <note type="footnote"> M 2 </note> <lb/>

            phones; Ach. 47, Birds 108, Eccl. 315, <lb/>
            &amp;c., and this little repetition of pet <lb/>
            names is the very place in which a <lb/>
            seeming irregularity is permissible. <lb/>
            Compare Frogs 1203. However, Person <lb/>
            and Blaydes have <foreign xml:lang="grc">νηττάριον ὑπεκορίζετ</foreign>’ <lb/>
            av Kai <foreign xml:lang="grc">φάττιον</foreign>, an alteration which <lb/>
            really destroys the charm of the verse; <lb/>
            Bothe and Bergk read <foreign xml:lang="grc">νηττάριον</foreign> and <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">βάτιον</foreign>, though Bentley had clearly <lb/>
            shown <foreign xml:lang="grc">βάτιον</foreign> to be impossible; Bergk <lb/>
            himself suggested <foreign xml:lang="grc">βάβιον</foreign>, a baby ; while <lb/>
            Meineke reads <foreign xml:lang="grc">φάβιον</foreign>, and is followed <lb/>
            by Holden, Velsen, Green, and Van <lb/>
            Leeuwen. But although the <foreign xml:lang="grc">φὰψ</foreign> is no <lb/>
            doubt another name for the <foreign xml:lang="grc">φάττα</foreign>, <lb/>
            Aristophanes never used the form <foreign xml:lang="grc">φὰψ</foreign>, <lb/>
            and no one ever used the diminutive <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">φάβιον</foreign> ; whilst <foreign xml:lang="grc">φάττα</foreign> is constantly used <lb/>
            by Aristophanes (Ach. 1105,1107, Peace <lb/>
            1004, Birds 303) and the diminutive <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">φάττιον</foreign> is found in some lines quoted <lb/>
            by Athenaeus (viii. chap. 58) from the <lb/>
            comic poet Ephippus, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀλεκτρυόνιον, φάτ­ <lb/>
            τιον, περδίκιον</foreign>. Moreover, as Bentley <lb/>
            observed, the words <foreign xml:lang="grc">νήττας</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">φάττας</foreign> <lb/>
            are in the Peace placed in juxta­ <lb/>

          <p>To give the English reader a clear idea of the difference between the <lb/>
            New Comedy which Aristophanes inaugurated in the Cocalus, and the Old <lb/>
            Attic Comedy represented in these volumes, it seems desirable to add here <lb/>
            a translation of one of the Plautine comedies, itself an adaptation from the <lb/>
            Greek. For this purpose the Menaechmi has been selected, partly for its <lb/>
            own merits, and partly because it is the original from which Shakespeare's <lb/>
            Comedy of Errors is, directly or indirectly, derived. Yet it is by no means <lb/>
            certain that the Greek play which Plautus is adapting, belonged to the <lb/>
            New Comedy at all. From line 12 of the Prologue " Non Atticissat <lb/>
            verum Sicilicissitat" it is suspected of being the work of some Sicilian <lb/>
            dramatist. Indeed, many would attribute it to Epicharmus, in which case <lb/>
            it would be very much older than the earliest Comedy of Aristophanes, <lb/>
            And as a slight corroboration of this date it might be urged that in Act II, <lb/>
            Scene 3, Erotium, running through the names of the sovereigns of <lb/>
            Syracuse, stops at Hiero, the patron of Epicharmus ; and that the abrupt­ <lb/>
            ness with which she terminates her speech may be due to the circumstance <lb/>
            that Epicharmus proceeded to mention some kindness shown by Hiero <lb/>
            to the family of Menaechmus, which Plautus omitted as uninteresting to <lb/>
            a Roman audience. This too would account for the surprise displayed by <lb/>
            Messenio at the intimate knowledge which Erotium possesses about the <lb/>
            affairs of Menaechmus. But on the other hand it is difficult to believe <lb/>
            that so deftly-constructed a Comedy, with so intricate and ingenious a plot, <lb/>
            can belong to so early a date. And anyhow the play exhibits, in a <lb/>
            marked degree, the general characteristics of the New Comedy.</p>
          <p>The translation has been made, in idle moments, from Mr. Hildyard's <lb/>
            edition of the play; and his arrangement and explanations have been <lb/>
            generally accepted without going further into the matter. The long verses <lb/>

            <title type="main">PROLOGUE</title>
          </head>
          <p>THE first thing, gentlemen, I wish to do <lb/>
            Is to give greeting to myself and you. <lb/>
            I bring you Plautus—not the MAN, the PLAY- <lb/>
            Please to be gracious to his work to-day. <lb/>
            And kindly listen whilst I tell the plan, <lb/>
            I'll be as brief as possibly I can. <lb/>
            One trick there is which all our poets ,try ; <lb/>
            Their scenes in Athens never fail to lie ; <lb/>
            By this they throw a Grecian air around them. <lb/>
            As for my facts you'll have them as I found them. <lb/>
            So to be Greek my tale will still endeavour, <lb/>
            Sicilian-wise, not Attic-wise, however. <lb/>
            This little preface comes my plot before, <lb/>
            But now the plot itself I'll pour and pour <lb/>
            Not by the peck or bushel but by barns, <lb/>
            So very generous am I in my yarns.</p>
          <p>Once on a time, 'tis thus the story runs, <lb/>
            A Syracusan merchant had twin sons. <lb/>
            So like they were, their very foster-mother <lb/>
            Could not the one distinguish from the other. <lb/>
            Nay she who bare them did not really know ; <lb/>
            One who had seen the children told me so. <lb/>
            I never saw them, I was only told. <lb/>
            Well, when the children now were seven years old, <lb/>
            The merchant freights a goodly ship, and bears <lb/>
            One little son amongst its numerous wares, <lb/>
            And so they reach Tarentum, there to trade ; <lb/>
            At home the other with his mother stayed. <lb/>
            While at Tarentum, to the games they go, <lb/>
            The people flocked, as usual, to the show ; <lb/>
             <pb n="174"/>
            The boy was lost amid the concourse vast, <lb/>
            Till in the crowd an Epidamnian passed, <lb/>
            Took him in charge, and back to Greece they crossed. <lb/>
            But the poor father, when his child was lost, <lb/>
            Lived a few days in heartless sad despair, <lb/>
            Then sickened, pined, and died of sorrow there. <lb/>
            The mournful tidings to the grandsire sped <lb/>
            Of the lost child, and hapless father dead ; <lb/>
            Who such affection to the lost one bore <lb/>
            He changed the name the other had before, <lb/>
            And as Menaechmus1 was the lost boy's name, <lb/>
            The other boy must also bear the same. <lb/>
            That name my tongue more readily repeats <lb/>
            Because 1 heard them cry it in the streets. <lb/>
            So then, beforehand, lest ye miss the plot, <lb/>
            I say the twins the self-same name have got.</p>
          <p>Now, that the facts ye clearly may discern, <lb/>
            To Epidamnus I'll on foot return. <lb/>
            Can I, for you, do any errand there ? <lb/>
            If so, with boldness what ye want declare. <lb/>
            But you must give the wherewithal to do it; <lb/>
            Or else you're fooling, and belike you'll rue it. <lb/>
            Yet if you give it, rue it more you will. <lb/>
            Now there I am, though here I'm standing still.</p>
          <p>The Epidamnian who, I said before, <lb/>
            Kidnapped the boy, and o'er the waters bore, <lb/>
            No child had he, his wealth was all he had ; <lb/>
            So he adopts the little kidnapped lad, <lb/>
            Makes him the husband of a well-dowered bride, <lb/>
            And heir to all his fortune when he died. <lb/>
            For once when, journeying to his farm, he fain <lb/>
            Would ford a river swoln by recent rain, <lb/>
            The river rose, impatient to destroy, <lb/>
            And carried off the man that carried off the boy. <note type="footnote"> 1 Menaechmus, the Prologist tells us, was also the grandsire's name. The <lb/>
            father, we shall presently find, was named Moschus, the mother, Theusimarche, <lb/>
            the twins, Menaechmus and Sosicles. </note> <pb n="175"/>
             </p>
          <p>So his great wealth descended to the twin ; <lb/>
            And here you see the house he's living in. <lb/>
            His brother, with a slave, is come to-day <lb/>
            To Epidamnus, if perchance he may <lb/>
            Find there the missing twin. This town must needs <lb/>
            Be Epidamnus while our play proceeds. <lb/>
            Another play, another town 'twill be, <lb/>
            For ever shifting, like our Company, <lb/>
            Where one poor player acts or youth or age, <lb/>
            King, pander, beggar, parasite or sage.</p><pb n="176"/>

          <p>PEN. THE boys nickname me Sponge-Peniculus <lb/>
            Because I clear away the crumbs so neatly. <lb/>
            And I believe that they who chain their captives, <lb/>
            And clap their fetters on their runaway slaves, <lb/>
            Defeat the object which they have in view. <lb/>
            If a poor wretch finds ill on ill redoubled, <lb/>
            He only wants to run away the more. <lb/>
            He tries all means to extricate himself; <lb/>
            One gets a file and files away the links, <lb/>
            One smashes out the rivet. Oh, mere trifling. <lb/>
            Whom you would keep without one thought of flight <lb/>
            Let him be strictly tethered by the tooth ; <lb/>
            Tie down his nozzle to a well-stored table. <lb/>
            So long as you provide him day by day <lb/>
            Eating and drinking to his heart's content, <lb/>
            He'll never flee ; he'd sooner die than flee. <lb/>
            These are the chains to chain him safe withal. <lb/>
            They're so elastic, these same belly-bands, <lb/>
            The more you stretch them, they but hold the tighter. <lb/>
            See here, I am going to Menaechmus now, <lb/>
            A willing slave, that he may bind me so. <lb/>
            Aye, he's the man ! he does not feed us, he <lb/>
            Recruits and sets us up ; he's a prime doctor; <lb/>
            Himself a lad of excellent good living. <lb/>
            Such banquets ! Heavens, he loads his tables so, <lb/>
            Piles mountain high his luscious dishes so, <lb/>
             <pb n="177"/>
            You needs must mount a chair to reach the top. <lb/>
            But now these many days I've given him rest, <lb/>
            Housed in my house with all that's dear to me, <lb/>
            For all the food I buy is passing dear. <lb/>
            But now these dear, dear comrades have deserted, <lb/>
            So back I come to him. Stay, the door opens. <lb/>
            Menaechmus'self! I see him. Here he comes.</p>

            0 if you weren't so stupid an idiot, 0 if you weren't so stubborn and dense, <lb/>
            All that you see your husband hating, you would yourself to hate commence. <lb/>
            And if you continue thus to act <lb/>
            I'll have you home to your father packed. <lb/>
            Now whenever I go out walking, you must detain me, and demand <lb/>
            Where I am walking, what I am doing, what is the business I have in hand, <lb/>
            And what I want and whither I go. <lb/>
            I've married a custom-house clerk, I know. <lb/>

            Over-indulgence 'tis that has spoilt you; now I'll my future plans declare. <lb/>
            Since I freely give you servants, purples, trinkets, wool, and dress. <lb/>
            Since you really want for nothing, Madam, you had better beware <lb/>
            And cease upon me a spy to be. <lb/>
            Still you shan't have spied for nothing; therefore I'll find some ladye light, <lb/>
            And I will make an express appointment, and I will dine with her to-night.</p>
          <p>PEN. (Aside.) Ah, he intends to hurt her feelings, but he is really hurting mine. <lb/>
            I am the sufferer more than she is, if he is going from home to dine.</p>
          <p>MEN. Goodness gracious! by my scolding I have driven my wife away. <lb/>
            Come then, come, intriguing husbands, bring me your gifts without delay, <lb/>
            Bring me your choicest gifts and offerings ; I have battled it like a man. <lb/>
            Here's a shawl I robbed my wife of; now it shall go to the courtesan. <lb/>
            Glorious deed, so sharp a turnkey, such a vigilant spy to cheat. <lb/>
            0, the action was bravely managed, quite artistic, clever, and neat. <lb/>
            At my peril I made the capture; it shall now to its fate be taken ; <lb/>

            A terrible foe I have put to flight, and secured my spoil, and saved my bacon.</p>

            prize ?</p>

            Welcome to you. PEN. And welcome to you. MEN. How fare you? PEN. I grasp my <lb/>
            good genius tight.</p>
          <p>MEN. In better time you couldn't have come ; you couldn't have come when I wished you more.</p>
          <p>PEN. Yes, that's my plan, I'm just the man the most convenient times to explore.</p>
          <p>MEN. Now would you look at a glorious treat ? PEN. 0, what cook cooked it, I pray you tell. <lb/>
            Only let me behold the fragments, and then I shall know if he cooked it well.</p>
          <p>MEN. Have you ever observed a painting, where was painted a wondrous deed, <lb/>
            Venus carrying off Adonis, or the Eagle, Ganymede?</p>
          <p>PEN. Many's the time, but why do you ask me ? MEN. Turn upon me your eyes ; declare, <lb/>
            See you anything here resembling ? PEN. What on earth is the dress you wear ?</p>
          <p>MEN. Say I'm the jolliest, jolliest fellow. PEN. Tell me where we a meal shall find.</p>

            Here have you and your wife been squabbling, and I on my guard must stand to-day.</p>

            Any word or thing, Menaechmus, save at your own express command.</p>
          <p>MEN. Seek we a tomb to bury the day in, such as my wife won't understand.</p>
          <p>PEN. Now you are making a good proposal. Where shall the funeral pyre be-spread ? <lb/>
            Let us at once begin to raise it ; truly the day is now half-dead.</p>
          <p>MEN. Draw we aside a little further. PEN. Well then. MEN. A little further. PEN. There.</p>
          <p>MEN. Even yet a little further from the lioness's lair.</p>
          <p>PEN. 0, by Pollux of this I'm sure, you'd make a capital charioteer.</p>
          <p>MEN. Why ? PEN. You are always looking behind you, looking to see if your wife be near.</p>
          <p>MEN. Now what say you ? PEN. What you wish me, I affirm and I deny.</p>

            When you have smelt it ? PEN. Sure the Augurs cannot guess it half so well.</p>
          <p>MEN. Come then, smell the shawl I'm wearing ; what does it smell of? won't you tell?</p>
          <p>PEN. At the top a man should always smell a womanly vestiment; <lb/>
            Here my nostrils are saluted with a most unsavoury scent.</p>

            Nay, but tarry. PEN. You've retarded fully a mile the cup, I swear.</p>
          <p>MEN. Knock then gently. PEN. I suppose you fear the doors are of earthenware.</p>

            (To Cyl.) Take the basket, and take the money ; here are three shillings to spend to-day.</p>
          <p>CYL. Thank you. ER. Go and provide a dinner, and mind you make it enough for three, <lb/>
            Neither too much nor yet too little. CYL. Tell me what kind of folk they be.</p>
          <p>ER. I, and Menaechmus, and Peniculus. CYL. Then I must buy for ten at least: <lb/>
            He, the parasite, does the duty of eight good guests at his patron's feast.</p>
          <p>ER. That's your business, now that I've named them. CYL. They can at once, if you like, begin it. <lb/>
            In a minute 'twill all be cooked. ER. Be quick. CYL. Why, I won't be gone a minute,</p>

          <p>Men. There is no pleasure to the weary sailor <lb/>
            More great, Messenio, than the distant land <lb/>
            Seen from the raging deep. MESS. One there is greater ; <lb/>
            It is to see the land you call your home. <lb/>
            But why, I prithee, have we come in hither ? <lb/>
            Are we to coast all islands like the sea ?</p>
          <p>Men. We come to seek my very own twin brother.</p>
          <p>MESS. And what's to be the limit of our seeking ? <note type="footnote">1 miluinam, a kite's appetite. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="181"/>
            'Tis now six summers since our search began. <lb/>
            And we have wandered round the coast of Spain, <lb/>
            Istria, Marseilles, Illyria, Adria, <lb/>
            And all the colonies of Greece, and all <lb/>
            The sea-lashed coasts of Italy. A needle <lb/>
            Who had so sought had found, if findable. <lb/>
            Go to: you seek the dead among the living ; <lb/>
            Were he alive, he had been found long since.</p>
          <p>Men. I want to find a man to tell me so; <lb/>
            One who can say for certain He is dead. <lb/>
            Then will I never seek for him again. <lb/>
            Till then, I'll never cease to follow him. <lb/>
            Dear to my heart of hearts is he, my brother.</p>
          <p>MESS. Knots in a reed ! We may as well go home, <lb/>
            Unless you mean to write a book of travels.</p>
          <p>Men. You had better keep your proverbs to yourself. <lb/>
            Don't trouble me ! I'm master here. MESS. Alack ! <lb/>
            That one expression shows me I'm a slave. <lb/>
            A fact was never more concisely stated. <lb/>
            Well, all the same I must, I will, speak out. <lb/>
            Listen to me, Menaechmus. Here's our purse <lb/>
            Full lightly stocked as for a summer trip. <lb/>
            And if we don't move homewards, I do think <lb/>
            Youll lose yourself before you find your brothel. <lb/>
            Know you the manners of these Epidamnians ? <lb/>
            They say this town is full of debauchees, <lb/>
            Full of deep drinkers, hungry sycophants, <lb/>
            And nimble cozeners : 'tis said to be <lb/>
            A very nest of wheedling courtesans. <lb/>
            And hence, no doubt, the name of Epidamnus, <lb/>
            Unwary travellers find damnation here.</p>
          <p>Men. I'll see to that; therefore, give me the purse.</p>
          <p>MEss. What do you want with it ? Men. I fear for you.</p>
          <p>MESS. How ? fear for me! Men. Lest Epidamnus damn us <lb/>
            Through your misdeeds. Messenio, you are amorous. <lb/>
            I am a reckless man, a dangerous man. <lb/>
            Give me the money, and we shun both dangers ; <lb/>

          <p>CYL. Really, Menaechmus, you've returned too soon ; <lb/>
            I'm on my way from market. Men. Pray, young man, <lb/>
            How are they selling sucking-pigs apiece ? <lb/>
            Tell me. CYL. One shilling. Men. Well then, take this shilling, <lb/>

            How know you me ? CYL. How should you think I know you ? <lb/>
            You know I serve your mistress here, Erotium.</p>

          <p>Men. No surely. CYL. Then belike you do not dwell <lb/>
            Within that house. Men. All who dwell there be hanged !</p>

            Menaechmus! Men. Well, sir. CYL. Take a friend's advice, <lb/>
            And that same shilling which you offered me <lb/>
            Go, buy yourself a sucking-pig therewith. <lb/>
            For you yourself must certainly be mad <lb/>
            To curse yourself as now you did, Menaechmus.</p>
          <p>MESS. 0, horrid man ! 0, most obnoxious man !</p>
          <p>CYL. This is his way; he often jokes me thus. <lb/>
            He's wondrous merry when his wife's away.</p>

            What are you dreaming of ? MESS. What can possess you <lb/>

            I know you not: this gentleman I know.</p>
          <p>Men. By Pollux, fellow, you are mad indeed.</p>
          <p>CYL. The meat I've got will speedily be cooked: <lb/>
            'Twill soon be ready; go not far away. <lb/>
            Any commands? .ren. Yes ; go and hang yourself.</p>

            Your words come true. MESS. Stand by, and see what happens. <lb/>
            For here, methinks, must dwell some courtesan, <lb/>

            Whene'er a foreign ship arrives in port, <lb/>
            They send at once their slaves and women down. <lb/>

            You are the one I must needs make much of; aye, and it's right your whims to please ; <lb/>
            You whose bounty has prosperous made me, given me wealth, and comfort, and ease.</p>
          <p>Men. 0, the lady is mad for certain ; madness or drink must needs derange her ; <lb/>
            Else she ne'er would address so freely me who to her am a total stranger.</p>
          <p>MESS. Didn't I tell you what would happen ? Now the leaves are beginning to fall, <lb/>
            Only tarry here three days longer, down will tumble the trees and all. <lb/>
            O these women of Epidamnus, regular traps for money are they. <lb/>
            Let me speak to the girl a moment. Listen, my lady. ER. What do you say ?</p>
          <p>MESS. Where in the world did you know my master? ER. Knew him of course where he <lb/>
            knew me; <lb/>
            Here, in the city of Epidamnus. MESS. Yes, in a city forsooth where he <lb/>
            Never set foot till just this morning. ER. Ah, you're a merry wag, no doubt. <lb/>
            Will you not enter, my own Menaechmus ? Better within than here without.</p>
          <p>Men. 0, by Pollux, I can't imagine where she has got my name so pat; <lb/>
            That is a marvel I cannot fathom. MESS. Nay, but I'll tell you what she is at. <lb/>
            'Tis that she smells the purse you are holding. Men. Likely enough ; we soon will see. <lb/>
            Take it yourself, and let's observe her, whether she loves my purse or me.</p>
          <p>ER. Will you not enter and dine, Menaechmus ? Men. No, but I thank you all the same.</p>

          <p>ER. Sponge and yourself. Men. What Sponge is that ? the one that I polish my boots withal?</p>
          <p>ER. He who came with you here this morning ; he who was here when you brought the shawl, <lb/>
            Which, you said, you had robbed your wife of. Men. 0, what in the world is it all about ? <lb/>
            Gave you a shawl I had robbed my wife of! a crazy woman, beyond a doubt. <lb/>
            Truly I think she dreams while standing, just in the style of the equine race.</p>

            Never had I a wife that I know of; none have I now in the whole wide earth; <lb/>
            Never set foot within your dwelling ; never once from the day of my birth. <lb/>

            What do you mean by "the ship," I wonder. Men. Ship, a vessel that comes oversea ; <lb/>
            Wooden its structure; planed and jointed ; oft by the mallet's stroke assailed ; <lb/>

            Born at Syracuse, Sicily's town, or so at least does the story run. <lb/>
            King Agathocles ruled there first; and next King Phintias came, I wot; <lb/>
            Thirdly, Liparo reigned ; and then, the throne and kingdom Hiero got; <lb/>
            Hiero reigns there now, I fancy. Men. Nothing is false in the tale you tell.</p>

            well?</p>
          <p>Men. Hercules! I can resist no longer. MESS. 0, for mercy's sake go not in. <lb/>
            Ruined you are, if you cross her threshold. Men. Don't to tutor me now begin. <lb/>
            0, the adventure goes on bravely. I as a guest shall be entertained ; <lb/>
            I'll assent to whatever she tells me. Lady, you think me perchance cross-grained; <lb/>

            He to my wife will all the story about the dinner and shawl disclose. <lb/>
            Now, whenever you like, we'll enter. ER. Then you won't for the parasite wait?</p>
          <p>Men. Nay, I care not a straw for the fellow ; nay, if he happen to come too late, <lb/>
            Close the door and let him not enter. ER. Gladly I'll do the thing you say. <lb/>
            Know you the favour I'm going to ask you ? Men. I will at once your commands obey.</p>
          <p>ER. Well, the shawl that you just now gave me take to the broiderer's shop, I pray, <lb/>
            There to have it retrimmed at once, with fresh embroideries fitted and sewn.</p>
          <p>Men. Hercules ! that's a capital notion, then of course it will never be known ; <lb/>
            Even my wife will never detect it, if ye two should happen to meet.</p>
          <p>ER. Then you will take it when you leave me ? Men. That I certainly will, my sweet.</p>
          <p>ER. Let us go in. Men. I'll follow at once, but first to my servant a word I'll say. <lb/>
            (She goes into the house.) <lb/>
            Hither, Messenio. MESS. What's the matter ? Men. Dance and sing for my luck this day.</p>
          <p>MESS. Is there a cause? Men. There certainly is. MESS. A cause why you to the dogs should go.</p>
          <p>Men. Knave that you are ; I've scarce begun, and yet already I've spoils to show. <lb/>
            Take to a tavern these sailor-lads as quick as you can ; when that job's done, <lb/>
            Come you hither again to meet me ; mind you are back ere set of sun.</p>
          <p>MESS. Don't you recognize these enchantresses, master mine? Men. Be silent, do. <lb/>
            If I'm doing a foolish thing, 'tis I shall suffer ; it won't be you : <lb/>
            This is a foolish ignorant woman, so far at least as I've made her out. <lb/>
            I'll despoil her. MESS. Mercy, he's gone. He's gone to his ruin, beyond a doubt. <lb/>
            Swiftly the privateer is towing, towing the skiff to dire disaster! <lb/>

            Chanced to make so vile a mistake as I've made to-day ; I call it a crime. <lb/>
            Into a public meeting I plunge, intent to hear what the speakers say ; <lb/>
            There I gape like a fool, the while Menaechmus quietly steals away. <lb/>
            He, I trow, to his love would go, nor wanted me there to join their eating. <lb/>

            They are the folk to attend at meetings, and all our civic assemblies too. <lb/>
            Then I never had lost to-day the splendid dinner I had in view. <lb/>
            Sure as I live, 'twas the will of the gods that I this bit of ill-luck should find! <lb/>
            Still, perhaps, I may get some scraps ; that hope a little consoles my mind. <lb/>
            Eh, but here is Menaechmus leaving! out he comes with a coronal on. <lb/>
            This is a cheerful time to arrive when all the dinner is over and done.</p>

            Dinner, and wine, and courtesan, from whom <lb/>

            Is it of me and my mischance he's talking ?</p>

            And gave it her. And though she talked so wildly, <lb/>
            I acquiesced in everything she said <lb/>

          <p>MEN. Ah me ! how wild and wearisome the plan <lb/>
            We all pursue ; our best and highest, most. <lb/>
            We get as many clients as we can, <lb/>
            And ask not what the virtues of a man, <lb/>
            But what his wealth, what income he can boast. <lb/>
            Or good, or bad, we reck not. Rather, all <lb/>
            In alien hues we paint; <lb/>
            The " poor but honest " man, a knave we call, <lb/>
            The wealthy knave, a saint. <lb/>
            Patrons fare ill, whose clients hold in awe <lb/>
            Nor equity, nor law ; <lb/>
            Trained litigants, who many a solemn trust <lb/>
            With perjured lips deny, <lb/>
            Rapacious usurers, who by claims unjust <lb/>
            Their gainful business ply. <lb/>
            The trial fixed, they send their patron word, <lb/>
            'Tis he must shield them, howsoe'er they erred. <lb/>
            'Tis he their cause must plead before the Judge, <lb/>
            Or Court, or People. Even so to-day <lb/>
            A tiresome client met me on my way, <lb/>
            And held me fast, and would not let me budge. <lb/>
            So my own business I perforce must slight, <lb/>
            And in the Edile's Court my client's battle fight. <lb/>
            There full hotly the conflict rages. <lb/>
            Knotty, intricate terms I offer, hoping to settle the suit off-hand, <lb/>
            Make a lengthy subtle oration, more or less as the facts demand, <lb/>
            All to prevent the staking of gages. <lb/>
            What does my fool do ? What do you think ? As true as I live, <lb/>
            Forward he comes his gage to stake, and a surety good and approved to give <lb/>
            Never in all my life I saw a man so utterly floored as he ; <lb/>
            Every single point in the case is against him proved by witnesses three. <lb/>
            Heaven confound the rascally fellow, he spoilt my day by going to law; <lb/>

            Hither I came as soon as I could ; but she's surely vexed at my long delay ; <lb/>
            Ah, but the shawl will make my peace, the shawl which I stole from my wife away, <lb/>
            Bringing it off for Erotium's use, and leaving it here at her house to-day. <lb/>
            PEN. Ha! do you twig? WIFE. An evil man I've wed. <lb/>

            Interest's due for your theft, I fancy ; and (Striking him) thus I pay you the debt I owe. <lb/>
            What! you thought to commit such crimes, and yet that your guilt would remain unseen.</p>
          <p>MEN. Wife, what mean you? WIFE. Me do you ask? MEN. Shall I ask of him? is it that <lb/>

            makes your colour alter ?</p>
          <p>MEN. Nothing at all. PEN. Except the shawl. Aye, that is the fault that makes him falter. <lb/>
            Ah, you shouldn't have dined without me. At him again with right goodwill.</p>
          <p>MEN. Can't you be quiet ? PEN. No, not I. 0 look, he's nodding to keep me still.</p>
          <p>MEN. Bless me, I neither winked nor nodded : that is a charge I at once deny.</p>
          <p>WIFE. 0, I'm a wretched unfortunate woman! MEN. Wife, are you wretched ? Do tell me why.</p>
          <p>PEN. Nought was ever so bold as he ! The man denies what you saw him do.</p>
          <p>MEN. Wife, by Jove and all the gods (is that a sufficient oath for you ?) <lb/>
            Here I swear that I never nodded. PEN. This she'll admit; but return you there.</p>
          <p>MEN. Whither ? PEN. Belike to the broiderer's shop, and fetch the shawl for your wife to wear.</p>
          <p>MEN. What shawl mean you ? WIFE. I'll say no more ; he can't remember the things he did.</p>
          <p>MEN. What is amiss ? Have some of the servants answered you back when their faults you chid ? <lb/>
            Ah, if they have, they shall sorely rue it. PEN. Now you are playing the fool, 'tis plain.</p>
          <p>MEN. Wife, you are troubled: I grieve to see you. PEN. Now you are playing the fool again.</p>
          <p>MEN. Some domestic, I'm sure, has vexed you. PEN. Playing the fool as you did before.</p>
          <p>MEN. Surely it was not I who vexed you. PEN. Now you are playing the fool no more.</p>
          <p>MEN. I, by Pollux, have wronged you not. PEN. Pshaw ! now you are playing the fool anew.</p>
          <p>MEN. (Putting his arm round her waist.) <lb/>
            Wife, what is it that puts you out ? PEN. Hallo, the gentleman's coaxing you!</p>

            now? <lb/>

            Didn't you say that my brain was addled ? didn't you say that you knew not me ? <lb/>
            Didn't you say (0 impudence rare !) that you were a stranger come oversea ?</p>
          <p>MEN. Never since the hour I left you, never once have I come this way.</p>
          <p>PEN. 0, I know you ! Little you fancied that I so well could your scorn repay. <lb/>
            All the matter I've told your wife. MEN. Why, what have you told her ? PEN. I don't <lb/>
            know. <lb/>
            Ask her yourself. MEN. My wife, what is it? what did he tell you a while ago ? <lb/>
            Why are you silent ? why not tell me ? WIFE. As though you knew not, you ask me this.</p>
          <p>MEN. Troth, if I knew, I wouldn't have asked you. PEN. 0, the dissembling knave he is ! <lb/>
            No, you cannot conceal the thing ; she knows it all; I have all proclaimed <lb/>
            Openly. MEN. What in the world do you mean ? WIFE. Well, since of nothing you <lb/>
            seem ashamed, <lb/>
            Since you will not yourself confess it, listen and I the trouble will show ; <lb/>
            Why I am vexed and what he told me, now, indeed, I will let you know. <lb/>
            'Tis that a shawl has from me been stolen. MEN. Stolen from me! is it really true ?</p>
          <p>PEN. See how neatly the rogue is quibbling. Stolen from HER, and not from you. <lb/>
            If from you the thing had been stolen, then 'twould be safe, nor be lost at all.</p>
          <p>MEN. Keep to yourself! wife, what's the matter ? Tell me. WIFE. I tell you, I've lost the shawl.</p>
          <p>MEN. Who was it stole it? WIFE. Well, by Pollux, the man who took it away should know.</p>
          <p>MEN. Who is the man ? WIFE. 'Tis one Menaechmus. MEN. Surely a villanous deed, I trow. <lb/>
            What Menaechmus is that? WIFE. 'Tis you. MEN. What, I? WIFE. Yes, you. <lb/>
            MEN. And who says so, pray ?</p>
          <p>WIFE. I. PEN. And I. And then to his love, Erotium here, he gave it away.</p>
          <p>MEN. Gave it ? what, I ? PEN. Yes, you ! you! you ! Now wouldn't you like a night-owl hired, ) <lb/>
            Always to say uhu uhu for we have said it until we're tired.</p>
          <p>MEN. Wife, by Jove and all the gods (is that a sufficient oath for you ?) <lb/>
            Here I swear that I never gave it. PEN. Rather swear that our tale is true.</p>
          <p>MEN. Really and truly it isn't given: really and truly 'tis only lent.</p>
          <p>WIFE. Who but a woman, in Castor's name, should lend a womanly vestiment? <lb/>
            Who but a man should lend a manly ? Nothing of yours have I lent at all, <lb/>

            Now I'm going. PEN. And what's for me, for the service good I have done this day ?</p>
          <p>WIFE. When of aught you are robbed yourself, the like good service I'll then repay. <lb/>
            (She goes into the house, and shuts the door.)</p>
          <p>PEN. That, she knows, will be never at all; I can't be robbed, for nothing I've got. <lb/>
            Drat the husband, and drat the wife ; I hope the gods will destroy the lot. <lb/>

          <p>ER. Why do you stand without, Menaechmus ? Dearest, come in. MEN. Nay, lady mine, <lb/>
            Know you wherefore I come to see you ? ER. Are you not come my love to crave ?</p>
          <p>MEN. No, I am come to ask you frankly, Will you give back the shawl I gave ? <lb/>
            Somehow or other, I know not how, my wife has discovered the whole affair. <lb/>
            Sweet, you shall have one twice as handsome, and you shall choose what sort you'll wear.</p>
          <p>ER. Shawl! I gave you the shawl but now, that you to the broiderer's shop might take it; <lb/>
            Gave you the bracelet too, to take to the goldsmith's shop that he new might make it.</p>
          <p>MEN. Me you gave the bracelet and shawl to ? Never ! never! Reflect I pray. <lb/>
            Since I brought you the shawl this morning, since to the forum I took my way, <lb/>
            Now do I first return and see you. ER. See me? Your object is plain to see. <lb/>
            0, you are going to swindle me, are you, out of the things you received from me ?</p>
          <p>MEN. Going to swindle you? No, not I. Why, don't I tell you my wife knows all, <lb/>
            Bids me restore the shawl I brought you? ER. Pray, did I ask you to bring the shawl? <lb/>
            Didn't you bring it yourself, unasked ? And didn't you freely the gift present ? <lb/>
            Now you would take it again and keep it. Take it and keep it then, I'm content. <lb/>
            Wear it, you and your wife, by turns; aye, stuff it in both your greedy eyne. <lb/>
            Only remember; never again shall you set your foot in this house of mine. <lb/>

            Look you out for some other girl, and hold her up for a jest and scoff.</p>
          <p>MEN. Hercules, she's in a terrible temper. Hi come back to me ! don't be off.</p>
          <p>ER. Still are you waiting ? What, do you dare to return and woo me ? MEN. 0, she's gone too, <lb/>
            Shutting me out. Upon my word, I'm the shuttest-out man that ever I knew. <lb/>
            First my wife, and then my mistress ; neither will listen, howe'er I plead : <lb/>

            Into some brothel he has plunged, I warrant.</p>

            I see him coming. Saved ! he brings the shawl.</p>
          <p>Men. I can but wonder where Messenio is.</p>

            Have you no shame, to come before my eyes <lb/>
            With that adornment, villain ? Men. Why, what now ? <lb/>

            Feigned Hecuba a bitch ? WIFE. I know not, I.</p>
          <p>Men. Because she did what you are doing now. <lb/>
            She heaped abuse on every one she met, ) <lb/>

            I'll show him all this wickedness ! Men. Are you sane ? <lb/>
            What wickedness? WIFE. Robbing your wife at home <lb/>
            Of shawl and jewels; bearing them away <lb/>
            To give your mistress. Is not this correct ?</p>
          <p>Men. Tell me some potion, if you know one, lady, <lb/>
            To help me bear your idle petulance. <lb/>
            I cannot tell what man you take me for ; <lb/>
            I have not known you since Parthaon's 1 time.</p>

          <p>FATH. Fast as my Age permits, as suits the case, <lb/>
            I'll labour on. Aye, mine's a tardy pace, <note type="footnote">1 Parthaon lived two generations before Hercules. He was the grandfather of <lb/>

            before the walls of Troy. </note> <pb n="197"/>
            </p>
          <p>I'm not deceived ; I know it all too well. <lb/>
            My strength has failed ; my nimbleness has flown ; <lb/>
            My limbs with eld and lassitude o'ergrown. <lb/>
            0 Age, who wins thee, wins a bitter bane ; <lb/>
            A host of ills thou bringest in thy train, <lb/>
            Ills great and sore, a lengthy roll to tell.</p>
          <p>But now I wonder, what can this portend, <lb/>
            This urgent call ? what makes my daughter send <lb/>
            To bid me come without a moment's pause ? <lb/>
            For what's the matter, why she wants me so, <lb/>
            She leaves untold. But pretty well I know <lb/>
            The reason why. Some pettifogging strife <lb/>
            Has risen betwixt the husband and the wife. <lb/>
            That, when she sends, is evermore the cause.</p>
          <p>These well-dowered wives, they glory in their hoards ; <lb/>
            They fain would always lord it o'er their lords ; <lb/>
            Haughty, and proud, and arrogant are they. <lb/>
            Not that their lords from blame are wholly free, <lb/>
            But wives should always somewhat lenient be. <lb/>
            My daughter's tale is evermore the same, <lb/>
            "Another row," "my husband's much to blame," <lb/>
            And that, I warrant, is her tune to-day. <lb/>
            Now I shall know what it's all about; <lb/>
            Here is she standing, her door without ; <lb/>
            There is her husband, glum, dejected; <lb/>
            'Tis just as I suspected. <lb/>
            I'll accost her. WIFE. I'll approach him. Welcome, welcome, my father dear.</p>
          <p>FATH. Welcome, daughter; well do I find you ? what is the reason you call me here ? <lb/>
            Why are you grieving ? why is your husband standing irate, and aloof from you ? <lb/>
            Here's been a battle-royal, doubtless ; battle of words betwixt you two. <lb/>
            Tell me which is to blame, and briefly: none of your lengthy speeches, please.</p>
          <p>WIFE. 'Tis not I am to blame, my father; there I can set your mind at ease. <lb/>
            0, but here I can live no longer ; father, I can't; you must take me off.</p>
          <p>PATH. Bless me, what in the world's the matter? WIFE. Here I am made a public scoff.</p>
          <p>FATH. Who is it makes you that, my daughter ? WIFE. Who but the husband you bade me wed. <pb n="198"/>
             </p>
          <p>PATH. Here is a regular downright quarrel. Haven't I often and often said <lb/>
            Neither yourself nor yet your husband ever to me your disputes should show ?</p>
          <p>WIFE. How can I help it now, my father? PATH. Well, do you really wish to know ?</p>
          <p>WIFE. Yes, if youll tell me. PATH. Haven't I warned you always to bear with your husband's ways? <lb/>
            Not to be watching whither he goes, or what he is doing, or where he stays ?</p>
          <p>WIFE. Well, but he courts a wanton woman, living close by. PATH. And serve you right. <lb/>
            Trust me, the more you worry and vex him, so much the more will he court for spite.</p>
          <p>WIFE. Often he drinks at the wanton's table. PATH. Think you he'll drink the less for you, <lb/>
            Either at hers or any one else's ? What the plague do you want to do ? <lb/>
            Really you might as well forbid him ever to make an engagement out, <lb/>
            Ever to ask a friend to dinner. 0, you'd have him a slave no doubt. <lb/>
            Really you might as well and wisely claim that his hands be always full, <lb/>
            Sitting amongst your maids and servants, carding his daily task of wool.</p>
          <p>WIFE. Surely I have retained a counsel not for myself, but for him, to plead ; <lb/>
            Here you stand, but for him you argue. PATH. Nay, if I find he is wrong indeed, <lb/>
            Then will I chide him far more sharply than you, my daughter, I've chid before. <lb/>
            Come, he allows you trinkets, dresses, maids in plenty, and household store ; <lb/>
            Sure 'twere best to be sober-minded, best in his doings to acquiesce.</p>
          <p>WIFE. Ah, but he rummages out my wardrobe, steals a trinket or steals a dress ; <lb/>
            Me he robs ; and my own adornments go his mistress's stores to fill.</p>
          <p>PATH. That's ill-done, if he really does it; if he doesn't, 'tis you do ill <lb/>
            Thus to accuse a man that's guiltless. WIFE. Why, father, look ! He has still the shawl: <lb/>
            And there's the bracelet he took the girl. He is bringing them back, since I know all.</p>
          <p>PATH. Now will I go and accost the husband ; then shall I quickly the truth find out. <lb/>
            Well, how goes it with you, Menaechmus? what have you two had words about? <lb/>
            Why so gloomy ? why is she angry ? why are ye standing apart so far ?</p>
          <p>Men. 0, by Jove and the gods, old man, whatever your name, whoever you are, <lb/>
            Here I solemnly vow and declare- PATH. Whatever about ? what is it, I pray ?</p>
          <p>Men. Here I vow that never I wronged yon railing woman who dares to say <lb/>
            I from her wardrobe fetched this shawl and carried it out of her house away. <lb/>
            0, if ever I've set my foot within the house where the jade abides, <lb/>
            Make me, Jove, a wretcheder man than all the wretches on earth besides !</p>
          <p>PATH. Surely you can't be sane, Menaechmus, to say such words, when you know full well <lb/>
            That you yourself, you maddest of men, within that house most certainly dwell!</p>
          <p>Men. What do you really say, old man, that within this house I am dwelling, I ?</p>
          <p>FATH. Can you deny it? Men. I do deny it. FATH. 'Tis too absurd that you this deny, <lb/>
            Unless you have shifted your home this night. Come hither, daughter. Can it be so ? <lb/>
             <pb n="199"/>
            Can you have shifted your home perchance? WIFE. Why, father, whither or why <lb/>
            should I go ?</p>
          <p>FATH. Faith, I know not. WIFE. He mocks you, father. FATH. Well, well, my daughter, <lb/>
            your wrath restrain. <lb/>
            Do be sober a while, Menaechmus ; enough we've had of this jesting vein.</p>
          <p>Men. Who in the world are YOU, old man ? whence come you? what's your concern with me? <lb/>
            How have I injured you, or her, that you should both so troublesome be ?</p>
          <p>WIFE. 0, how vivid his eyes are growing! 0, look how over temple and brow <lb/>
            Suddenly spreads a greenish tint! Look, look how his eyes are sparkling now!</p>
          <p>Men. Come, if they mean to pronounce me mad, what better thing can I do or say <lb/>
            Than feign myself to be really mad ? Perchance I shall frighten the pair away.</p>
          <p>WIFE. How he yawns and stretches his limbs! 0 father, what is our safest plan ?</p>
          <p>FATH. Come you hither, my daughter, keeping out of his reach as far as you can.</p>
          <p>Men. Evoi ! Bromius ! Yea, I hear thee calling me forth to thy woodland chase. <lb/>
            Ah, but I cannot join thy hunting, cannot escape from this dismal place. <lb/>
            There on my left a bitch is watching, ready to bite me,—mad she is,- <lb/>
            Here on my right is a bearded goat: and 0, with those perjured lips of his <lb/>
            Many and many an honest townsman he in his time has destroyed alone.</p>
          <p>FATH. Out upon you ! Men. Hark! Apollo speaks from his high prophetic throne ; <lb/>
            Seize the vixen, burn her eyes out, burn with a flaming torch, he cries.</p>
          <p>WIFE. Help me, father ! help ! the villain's going to burn out both my eyes.</p>
          <p>Men. (Aside.) Me they choose to accuse of madness; they were the first to be mad, I trow.</p>
          <p>FATH. Hist, my daughter ! WIFE. What's to be done ? FATH. Well, what if to fetch my slaves I go, <lb/>
            Bid them lift and carry him off, and safely there in the house bestow, <lb/>
            Ere he create some fresh disturbance ? Men. (Aside.) By heaven, unless by some crafty trick <lb/>
            I can the plot forestall, the rogues will carry me off to their house full quick. <lb/>
            (Aloud.) Dost thou warn me to leave no inch of the vixen's face unscored with blows ? <lb/>
            Must I blacken it all ? ah well, unless this moment away she goes, <lb/>
            I'll obey thy command, Apollo ! FATH. 0 flee, my daughter, with all your might <lb/>
            Lest he pound you to death. WIFE. I'll flee. 0 keep him, father, I pray, in sight. <lb/>
            Let him not follow. 0 wretched wife, to hear from my husband such words as these! <lb/>
            (She runs out.)</p>
          <p>Men. Well am I rid of her; but him! Aha! must I now Tithonus seize, <lb/>
            Dissolute, bearded, tremulous dotard ? Is it on him thou biddest me rush, <lb/>
            And all his joints, and all his bones, and all his members to mincemeat crush <lb/>
            Ev'n with the staff that himself is holding? FATH. Keep off! You had better ! I vow <lb/>
            you'll rue it, <lb/>
             <pb n="200"/>
            If me you touch with your finger-tip, or approach one single step to do it.</p>
          <p>Men. Yea, I'll obey thy dread commands ; I'll seize my double-edged axe, and hew, <lb/>
            Hew to the bone the dotard piecemeal, slicing his entrails through and through.</p>
          <p>FATH. Truly, methinks, I must take precautions, guarding my life with my utmost skill, <lb/>
            Else I fear that this crazy fellow will work me harm, as he swears he will.</p>
          <p>Men. Manifold thy commands, Apollo ! now must I harness my steeds of war, <lb/>
            Tameless, fiery, terribly-prancing, yoke the team and ascend the car ; <lb/>
            Under their hoofs I'll trample the lion, trample the lion so rank and old. <lb/>
            Now aloft in the car I'm standing; I grasp the reins, and the scourge I hold. <lb/>
            Show your mettle, my strong wild horses, let the clatter of hoofs resound ; <lb/>
            On with vehement quick curvetting; bend your knees and cover the ground.</p>
          <p>PATH. Me do you threaten with prancing horses ? Men. Lo, Apollo appears anew! <lb/>
            Spring upon and murder the dotard, is it that thou biddest me do ? <lb/>
            Nay, but who is THIS that drags me from the chariot by my hair, <lb/>
            Abrogating, 0 Apollo, thy commandments everywhere ? <lb/>
            (He retires into the background, as if the paroxysm were over.)</p>
          <p>PATH. 0 fatal, sad disease ! 0 gracious gods, <lb/>
            How is he fallen from his high estate! <lb/>
            How sudden and how terrible his madness ! <lb/>
            I'll go at once and summon a physician. (He goes out.)</p>
          <p>Men. Aye, are they gone, I prithee, from my sight, <lb/>
            Who make me play the madman, though not mad ? <lb/>
            Best get a-ship-board safely while I can. <lb/>
            And, 0 spectators, if the old man returns, <lb/>
            Pray don't inform him by what street I fled.</p>

            <title type="sub">MENAECHMUS. DOCTOR. FATHER.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>MEN. This is a cross and peevish day, when all goes wrong whatever I do. <lb/>
            What I wanted to keep concealed is blazoned forth to the public view. <lb/>
            That Ulysses of mine it was, my parasite-fool, who divulged the thing, <lb/>
            Filling me full of shame and trouble, bringing disgrace on his host and king. <lb/>
            Ah if I live, the treacherous fellow shall for his fault with his life atone. <lb/>
            Why do I say “ his life " I wonder. It is not his, it is mine alone. <lb/>
            He at my table and cost sustains it. I'll of his BREATH deprive the man. <lb/>
            Then this woman behaves as falsely as is the way with a courbezan. <lb/>
            When to restore the shawl I ask her, wishing therewith to appease my wife, <lb/>
            She has already, she vows, restored it. Verily, mine is a luckless life.</p>
          <p>FATH. What does he say ? DOCT. That his life is luckless. PATH. Please to accost him now <lb/>
            with care.</p>
          <p>DOCT. Health and strength to yourself, Menaechmus. Why do you keep your arm so bare ? <lb/>
            Know you not that, in your disease, a chill may greatly retard your healing ? <lb/>
            (Under pretence of covering up his arm, the Doctor attempts to feel his pulse. Menaechmus repulses him with violence.)</p>
          <p>MEN. Go and be hanged, you meddlesome fellow ! PATH. Feel you aught? DOCT. Why I can't <lb/>
            help feeling; <lb/>
            Not to an acre of hellebore-draughts will yield, I fancy, your friend's disease. <note type="footnote"> p </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="202"/>
            Now, Menaechmus, attend. MEN. What would you ? Doer. Answer the questions I ask <lb/>
            you, please. <lb/>
            Which do you drink, white wine or red ? MEN. 0, heaven confound you to all things ill</p>
          <p>FATH. Now is his madness beginning to work. MEN. And why not ask me, if such your will, <lb/>
            Whether the bread I prefer to eat is purple- or scarlet- or saffron-hued ? <lb/>
            Birds with scales, or fishes with wings, are these, peradventure, my favourite food ?'</p>
          <p>FATH. Fie ! do you hear the stuff he's talking ? Had you not better, without delay, <lb/>
            Give him a soothing draught or e'er his madness over him gains, full sway ?</p>
          <p>DOCT Wait! I'll ask him a few more questions. FATS. Goodness ! You'll prate us to death, <lb/>
            I know.</p>
          <p>Doer. Answer me this ; those eyes of yours, do they ever hard and immovable grow ?</p>
          <p>MEN. What! you think me a locust, do you, you stupidest noodle that ever I found ?</p>
          <p>Doer. Answer me this ; do you ever observe your bowels making a rumbling sound ?</p>
          <p>MEN. When I am full, they never rumble ; when I am hungry, then they do.</p>
          <p>Doer. Well, there's nothing insane in that; the answer is perfectly right and true. <lb/>
            Come, can you sleep when you first lie down, and sleep you soundly till dawn of day ?</p>
          <p>MEN. Aye, I can soundly sleep till dawn when all my debts I've managed to pay. <lb/>
            0 may Jove and all the gods destroy this questioner, root and stem !</p>
          <p>Doer. Now, indeed, is his madness beginning ! 'Tis best to be careful with words like them.</p>
          <p>FATH. Nay, this language is far less wild than that which he uttered a while ago, <lb/>
            When here my daughter, his wife, he said was a mad young bitch, and threatened her so.</p>
          <p>MEN. What did I say ? PATH. I say you're mad. MEN. What I? FATH. Yes you, who <lb/>
            are standing before me. <lb/>
            You who threatened to trample me down, and drive your terrible war-steeds o'er me. <lb/>
            I am the man who of this accuse you ; I was present, and saw the whole.</p>
          <p>MEN. I am the man who know that YOU the sacred crown of Jupiter stole ; <lb/>
            Also I know that you, for that, were into a loathsome dungeon cast; <lb/>
            Yea, and under the yoke were scourged, when out of the prison you came at last, <lb/>
            Also I know that you murdered your father and sold your mother. Is this not sane <lb/>
            Thus, for the charges against me brought, to retort the like on yourself again ?</p>
          <p>FATH. Now, whatever you're going to do, I pray you do it without delay. <lb/>
            Surely you see the man's a madman. Doer. Well, shall I tell you the wisest way? <lb/>
            Have him conveyed to my house forthwith. FATH. You think that best? DOCT. <lb/>
            I certainly do, <lb/>
            Then I'll at my discretion treat him. FATH. We'll do whatever's advised by you.</p>
          <p>Door. For twenty days I'll make you imbibe my potions of hellebore, day and night.</p>
          <p>MEN. For thirty days I'll string you up, and scourge your body with all my might.</p><pb n="203"/>
            
          <p>Doer. Run you and fetch your varlets here, to carry him hence to my own shop-door.</p>
          <p>PATH. Fetch, how many ? Doer. So far as I'm able to gauge his disease, not less than four.</p>
          <p>PATH. Certainly. Keep you an eye on the patient. Doer. Nay I'll run home, and at once <lb/>
            prepare <lb/>
            What is for his reception needed. Order the varlets to carry him there.</p>
          <p>PATH. Yes, I'll see that at once they do it. Doer. Then now I'm going. Good-bye. PATH. <lb/>
            Good-bye. (They go out.)</p>
          <p>MEN. Now my father-in-law has vanished, and now the doctor. Alone am I. <lb/>
            Jove a' mercy, what ails the fellows that all at once they pronounce me mad ? <lb/>
            Why, from the very hour of my birth I never a day's disease have had. <lb/>
            Not one trace of madness have I, nor any quarrel or broil I seek. <lb/>
            I am in health like those about me ; I know my friends, to my friends I speak. <lb/>
            Maybe, the people who call me mad a touch of madness themselves have got. <lb/>
            What's to be done ? I'd fain go home, but here my wife will admit me not. <lb/>
            There again I'm denied admittance. Verily I'm in a doleful plight. <lb/>
            Here, however, I'll stay at present; they'll let me in, I presume, at night.</p>

          <p>MESS. A servant's virtue may by this be known, <lb/>
            If the like zeal, and watchfulness, and care <lb/>
            Be, when his lord is absent, freely shown <lb/>
            As when his lord is there. <lb/>
            No man of sense his greedy guts will rate <lb/>
            Higher than legs and back. <lb/>
            And well he knows what punishments await <lb/>
            III deed or service slack.</p>
          <p>The mill, the fetters, hunger, cold, and blows, <lb/>
            Hard labour, fits of lassitude severe, <lb/>
            These are the wages that a lord bestows <lb/>
            On worthless knaves ; these are the ills I fear, <lb/>
            I therefore to be good, not bad, propose. <lb/>
            Hard words I reek not; I detest hard blows; <note type="footnote"> P a </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="204"/>
            What a mill grinds, I'd liefer eat than grind ; <lb/>
            So all my lord's behests I keep with constant mind.</p>
          <p>And this avails me much. Their private gain <lb/>
            Let others seek ; I'll do the things I ought; <lb/>
            I'll serve with fear ; from every fault abstain ; <lb/>
            Always at hand when sought. <lb/>
            Such are the useful slaves. Who nothing fear, <lb/>
            These greatly fear when punishments ensue ; <lb/>
            I little fear; and now the time is near <lb/>
            When my reward is due.</p>
          <p>The goods and the sailor-lads I've lodged, as master bade, in the tavern, and I <lb/>
            Hither have come to meet him again. I'll knock, and tell him I'm here, hard by. <lb/>
            0 that out of this lair of Ruin he by my aid could be safely won ! <lb/>
            Ah, but I fear too late I'm coming, after the battle is over and done.</p>

          <p>PATH. Now by all the Powers I charge you, listen with heed to the words I say, <lb/>
            What I've told you, and what I tell you, see that ye do it without delay, <lb/>
            Let him aloft from the ground be hoisted ; then to the doctor's shop be taken, <lb/>
            If your ribs and legs ye value, and if ye desire to save your bacon. <lb/>
            Never you heed whatever he calls you ; never you value his threats a pin. <lb/>
            Now already he ought to be hoisted ; what are ye waiting for ? Quick, begin. <lb/>
            I'll to the doctor's shop be going, there to await you. MEN. I'm undone. <lb/>
            What in the world is going to happen ? Why do these fellows about me run ? <lb/>
            What are ye wanting ? What are ye seeking ? Why are ye closing around me so ? <lb/>
            Whither, 0 whither, away are ye bearing me ? Ho, Epidamnians! Citizens, ho ! <lb/>
            Help, 0 help me, I pray and beseech of you ! Loose me, ye kidnapping rogues, leave go.</p>
          <p>MESS. What do I see, ye gods Immortal ? Surely I see some ruffians there <lb/>
            Hoisting my master up sky-high, and bearing him off to—I know not where.</p>
          <p>MEN. What, will nobody dare to assist me ? MESS. 0 yes, my master, I'll more than dare. <lb/>
            Citizens ! here's a scandalous outrage ! What, shall my master, in opea day, <lb/>
            Here in the street of a peaceful city, be seized perforce and carried away, <lb/>
            He who amongst you a free man came ? <lb/>
             <pb n="205"/>
            Loose your hold! MEN. 0 help me! help ! I pray and beseech you, whatever <lb/>
            your name, <lb/>
            Suffer them not on me to practise so signal an outrage in all men's sight.</p>
          <p>MESS. Help you ? yes, I'll help and defend, and succour you, master, with all my might, <lb/>
            You I'll never permit to perish, 'twere meeter for me to perish than you ! <lb/>
            Now the fellow who's got you aloft there, scoop out his eye, my master, do. <lb/>
            As for these, in their villanous faces a plentiful crop of weals I'll sow. <lb/>
            Ah in an evil hour for yourselves ye are haling him off. Let go ! Let go !</p>
          <p>MEN. Here's my finger in this one's eye. MESS. Then make the socket appear instead. <lb/>
            Hah, ye scoundrels ! Hah, ye bandits ! Hah, ye kidnappers. VARLETS. 0 we're dead ! <lb/>
            0, I beseech you, mercy ! MESS. Loose him. MEN. Why have ye laid your hands on me ? <lb/>
            Give them with both your fists a dressing. MESS. Villains be off to the gallows-tree ! <lb/>
            You, because you are off the hindmost, here's a special reward for you. <lb/>
            There, I've scored their faces finely, quite in the way I wished to do. <lb/>
            Pollux! I came to help you, master, just, as I think, in the hour of need.</p>
          <p>MEN. Aye young fellow, whoe'er you are, may Heaven reward you for this good deed, <lb/>
            But for you and your timely aid I had not lived till the set of sun.</p>
          <p>MESS. Then if right you would do, my master, grant me the freedom I've fairly won.</p>
          <p>MEN. Grant you freedom! what, I grant you ? MESS. Because I have saved you sir, but now.</p>
          <p>MEN. 0 you mistake, young man ! MESS. Mistake? MEN. By father Jove, I protest and vow, <lb/>
            Never were you a slave of mine. MESS. 0 hush, for shame! MEN. But I tell you true; <lb/>
            Never a slave of mine has done so much for me as was done by you.</p>
          <p>MESS. Well, if you're certain I'm not your slave, why shouldn't you bid me at once go free ?</p>
          <p>MEN. BE THOU FREE. Go WHITHER THOU WILT : so far at least as it rests with me.</p>
          <p>MESS. What! do you free me ? MEN. I certainly do, if mine the right to perform the deed.</p>
          <p>MESS. Hail! my patron. I'M 1 GLAD AT HEART, MESSENIO, THUS TO BEHOLD YOU FREED. <lb/>
            You, spectators, I call to witness. But 0, my patron, command me still, <lb/>
            Just as though I remained your slave : I'll always be ready to do your will. <lb/>
            Still in your house I'll live, and now when home you journey, I'll go there too.</p>
          <p>MEN. Heaven forbid ! MESS. And now, my patron, I'll go to the tavern, to fetch for you <lb/>
            Thence the silver and goods. The purse is safely sealed in my bag, I trow, <lb/>
            And all the things for our journey bought; I'll go and fetch them. MEN. Make haste, <lb/>
            and go.</p>
          <p>MESS. Just as you gave them, I'll now restore them. Here await me awhile, I pray. (He goes out.) <lb/>
            1 There being no third person to pronounce this formula, Messenio pronounces <lb/>
            it himself. Nobody knew his name but himself. For a repetition of these <lb/>
            formulas, see the final scene of this play. <pb n="206"/>
            </p>
          <p>MEN. 0 what wild and wonderful things around me seem to occur to-day. <lb/>
            Some declare that I'In not myself, and close their houses, and shut me out, <lb/>
            These two lately pronounced me mad. I can't conceive what it'a all about. <lb/>
            Then this fellow who's going, he says, to fetch some silver ; who vows that he <lb/>
            One of my slaves has always been, whom I (preserve me!) have just set free, <lb/>
            Tells me the purse of silver is mine, and he's bringing it here for myself to use ! <lb/>
            Faith, if he does, I'll tell him again he's free to depart wherever he choose. <lb/>
            Else, if he chance to recover his senses, he'll claim the money which now he brings. <lb/>
            Surely they differ no whit from dreams, all these most wild and wonderful things. <lb/>
            Now though Erotium seems so cross, I'll try to make her my friend once more. <lb/>
            Maybe she'll render me back the shawl that I to my wife may the thing restore. <lb/>

            Didn't I snatch you from four strong varlets who had you up in their arms sky-high ? <lb/>
            And you were invoking gods and men to come to your aid, and in came I <lb/>
            Tussled and fought with all the four, and wrenched you out of their hands at length ; <lb/>
            Therefore it was that you set me free, because I preserved you with all my strength. <lb/>
            Then for the money and goods I went: and you, returning, before me run, <lb/>
            Meet me here, and at once deny the very thing that you just have done.</p>

            Therefore, I say, my name's Menaechmus. Men. That is my name, you must understand.</p>

            You're my lord ; (To Men.) you, seek a servant; (To Men.) welcome to you ; (To Men.) to you <lb/>
            farewell, <lb/>

            O unless I am much mistaken, here the two twin-brothers stand; <lb/>
            One their name, and one their father, one moreover their fatherland. <lb/>
            Now will I summon my lord apart. Menaechmus! MEN. and Men. Yes. MESS. Don't <lb/>
            both reply, <lb/>
            Which of you two on the vessel arrived along with me. MEN. It was not I.</p>
          <p>Men. I'm the man. MESS. Then come you hither. Men. Here I am come; so now begin.</p>
          <p>MESS. Either that is a rank impostor, or he's your brother, the long-lost twin. <lb/>
            Never two men so like each other has it been yet my lot to see ; <lb/>
            Drops of milk, or drops of water, are not so alike as you and he. <lb/>
            Then your father and fatherland he claims them both as being his own. <lb/>
            Had we not better at once draw nigh, and question the man till the truth be known ?</p>
          <p>Men. Verily yours is a bright conjecture, and many thanks for your zeal I owe. <lb/>
            Go you on to finish the task; and BE THOU FREE if indeed you show <lb/>
            Yon is my brother, alive and well. MESS. I hope to show it. Men. I hope you may.</p>

             </p>
          <p>MESS. This man's name is Menaechmus also. Further, your native city is <lb/>
            Sicily's Syracuse, you tell us ; Sicily's Syracuse is his. <lb/>
            Then your father, you say, was Moschus ; Moschus was his, as myself can tell. <lb/>
            Now if you two will kindly help me, methinks you are helping yourselves as well.</p>
          <p>MEN. Ah, young fellow, so much I owe you, I can nothing you ask deny. <lb/>
            Just as if for a slave you'd bought me, 111 with all your demands comply.</p>
          <p>MESS. Well, I hope to prove you brethren, of the selfsame father born, <lb/>
            And the very selfsame mother, on the very selfsame morn.</p>
          <p>MEN. Verily that's a wondrous story. Can you indeed your words fulfil ?</p>
          <p>MESS. Yes, if both will my questions answer, then, believe me, I can and will.</p>
          <p>MEN. Ask whatever you want to know ; I'll tell you all: I'll nought suppress.</p>
          <p>MESS. Isn't your name Menaechmus? MEN. Granted. MESS. Is not yours Menaechmus? <lb/>
            Men. Yes.</p>
          <p>MESS. Wasn't your father's Moschus? MEN. 'Twas so. Men. Moschus was my father's name.</p>
          <p>MESS. Are you not a Syracusan? MEN. Yes. MESS. And you? Men.And I the same.</p>
          <p>MESS. So far all exactly tallies : help me to complete the case. <lb/>
            What's your earliest recollection of your earliest dwelling-place ?</p>
          <p>MEN. When we left it, I and father, for Tarentum, there to trade; <lb/>
            There amidst the crowd I lost him ; thence was hitherward conveyed.</p>
          <p>Men.Gracious Jupiter, preserve me! MESS. (To Men.)O, be silent if you please. <lb/>
            (To Men.) Can you still your age remember, when they brought you o'er the seas ?</p>
          <p>MEN. Seven years old ; I just was losing then my teeth, my earliest ones. <lb/>
            Never again have I seen my father. MESS. Know you this ; how many sons <lb/>
            Had your father ? MEN. I'd a brother ; only one, as it seems to me.</p>
          <p>MESS. And were you or he the elder ? MEN. Elder ? neither I nor he.</p>
          <p>MESS. How do you mean ? MEN. We were two twin brothers. Men.Gracious are the gods <lb/>
            to-day!</p>
          <p>MESS. 0 be still, or I'll hold my tongue. Men.Nay I'll hold mine. MESS. I beseech you, say <lb/>
            Bare ye both one name ? MEN. By no means. Mine indeed has always been <lb/>
            As it still remains, Menaechmus. Sosicles they called my twin.</p>
          <p>Men.O 1 can refrain no longer; every single note agrees. <lb/>
            0 my own twin-brother, welcome. I'm your brother Sosicles !</p>
          <p>MEN. What do you tell me ? How then comes it that you are called Menaechmus too ?</p>
          <p>Men.When the fatal tidings reached us, (father dead, and vanished you,) <lb/>
            Then the names our grandsire altered, giving me what was yours before.</p>
          <p>MEN. That I well believe would happen. Still I'll test you with one thing more. <lb/>
            Name our mother. Men.Theusimarché. MEN. 0 then, everything concurs. <lb/>
             <pb n="209"/>
            0 my brother, 0 unhoped for after all this lapse of years, <lb/>
            Welcome, welcome ! Men.O my brother, whom through years of toil and strain <lb/>
            Vainly until now I've sought for, welcome to my heart again !</p>
          <p>MESS. (To Men.)'Twas for him the lady took you, not for yourself, I can plainly see. <lb/>
            When she asked you in to dinner, she thought, I warrant, that you were he.</p>
          <p>MEN. Pollux ! I ordered a dinner here to be for myself prepared this day: <lb/>
            'Twas from my wife to be kept a secret, because I had stolen her shawl away, <lb/>
            And given it here to my lady fair. Men.Is this, my brother, the shawl you mean?</p>
          <p>MEt;. How in the world did you come by that? Men.The lady invited me in, I ween, <lb/>
            Her dinner I ate ; her wine I drank; I sat by the side of her, nowise loth ; <lb/>
            The shawl she gave me, the bracelet too ; she vowed it was I who had given her both.</p>
          <p>MEN. Glad I am if to you, my brother, anything good has chanced to accrue <lb/>
            Owing to me; she supposed no doubt 'twas I she was feasting, and lo! 'twas you.</p>
          <p>MESS. Cannot I now indeed go free, as you sir bade me a while ago ?</p>
          <p>MEN. Aye, for my sake, my brother, assent; 'tis meet and right that it should be so.</p>
          <p>Men.BE THOU FREE. MEN. I AM GLAD AT HEART, MESSENIO, THUS TO BEHOLD YOU FREED.</p>
          <p>MESS. Ah, but a better sanction than yours it needed to set me free indeed.</p>
          <p>Men.All our hopes are fulfilled, my brother ; were it not better that now we two <lb/>
            Back to our home return together ? MEN. Brother, what pleases yourself, I'll do. <lb/>
            Here will I hold a public auction, here will I sell whate'er I've got. <lb/>
            Let us go in, my brother. Men.Surely. MESS. Now would I ask you for-know you what?</p>
          <p>MEt;. What do you want ? MESS. To be auctioneer. MEN. I gladly grant you the boon you <lb/>
            seek.</p>
          <p>MESS. Now shall I make the proclamation? When shall it be? MEN. On this day week.</p>
          <p>MESS. 0 yes ! 0 yes! <lb/>
            This day week a public auction I of Menaechmus's goods will hold. <lb/>
            Farms and houses, slaves and chattels, all his effects will then be sold. <lb/>
            All for what they will fetch are offered ; money down we of course require : <lb/>
            Even his wife will come to the hammer, if so be we can find a buyer. <lb/>
            Hardly, methinks, a round five millions shall we obtain for all we sell. <lb/>
            Now then give us your cheers, spectators, give us your cheers, and-FARE YE WELL.</p><pb n="-"/>

          </head>
          <p>" Every student of Greek, old and young, will give a hearty welcome to the <lb/>
            latest fruit of Mr. Rogers's brilliant scholarship and dainty wit. It is hard to find <lb/>
            lines which move one to anything but lively admiration. The Commentary is <lb/>
            a masterly example of how a beautiful poem should be handled."—Manchester <lb/>
            Guardian.</p>
          <p>" The editorial work is just what it should be, careful, complete, and con­ <lb/>
            vincing ; and the translation is fascinating. Mr. Rogers has far more than a <lb/>
            scholarly knack of translation ; he has a remarkable gift, a power of idiom which <lb/>
            would as certainly have appealed to Aristophanes, as it commands the admiration <lb/>
            of scholars to-day. The English version is not only a delightful companion to the <lb/>
            scholar; it is highly entertaining in itself."—Athenæum,</p>
          <p>" The Commentary is full of scholarly remarks on the language of the play, as <lb/>
            well as interesting illustration of its matter drawn from modern as well as ancient <lb/>
            literature. But the chief feature of course is the translation, which shows all the <lb/>
            point, force, and ingenuity, which we expect from the editor. The Bird-call has all <lb/>
            the 'heart' of the Shakespearian lyric.”—Academy.</p>
          <p>"A piece of work admirable both for scholarship and literary insight."- <lb/>
            Contemporary Review.</p>
          <p>“ It is almost superfluous to commend the scholarly fulness of Mr. Rogers's <lb/>
            introduction, textual notes, and appendix to those who have read his previous <lb/>
            volumes.... We may well say of Aristophanes, and in a measure of his translator <lb/>
            also, <foreign xml:lang="grc">κατεμελίτωσετὴν λόχμην</foreign> —TheTimes.</p>
          <p>" We have only praise for his version. The notes show not only a wide scholar­ <lb/>
            ship, but a humanity and a knowledge of men and books so unusual in a classical <lb/>
            editor that we confess that the notes alone make a delightful book.”—Daily <lb/>
            Chronicle.</p>
          <p>"A rare combination of scholarly ability and the literary gift.... An ideal <lb/>
            edition for a scholar who is not troubled by elementary difficulties.”—Tribune.</p>
          <p>" This is indeed a most valuable edition of the great comic poet. The scholar, <lb/>
            the man who merely likes to keep up his classics, and even the man who has <lb/>
            no classics to keep up, can all meet upon the common ground of Mr. Rogers's <lb/>
            fruitful revision of the text, his luminous and painstaking introduction, and the <lb/>
            Attic grace and lightness of his English renderings."—Pall Mall Gazette.</p><pb n="2"/>
            
          <p>" Treats with conspicuous success the most brilliant of the plays."—Scotsman.</p>
          <p>" Sustains in every respect the reputation which the earlier volumes have won <lb/>
            for this accomplished scholar."— Manchester Courier.</p>
          <p>“ The reputation of Mr. Rogers as a critic and translator of Aristophanes is of <lb/>
            the highest, and the present edition of the Birds brings out his best qualities.... <lb/>
            The charm of its exquisite lyrics lives again in such a version of the hoopoe's <lb/>
            serenade as this.... The dullest of lads would be attracted by these delightful <lb/>
            pages.... It is an admirable volume, and increases the debt which both literature <lb/>
            and learning already owe to its author."—Spectator,</p>
          <p>"We have derived both pleasure and instruction from reading the notes. But <lb/>
            the translation makes the charm of the book. Mr. Rogers has here a thoroughly <lb/>
            congenial subject, and since he is at his best in lyric verse, he has here ample scope <lb/>
            for his powers. And as a whole the version is a brilliant success."—Guardian.</p>
          <p>"Repeats his previous triumphs of insight and skill. The spirit and the <lb/>
            felicity of his rendering are unequalled; it is truly Aristophanes in English, with all <lb/>
            his spontaneity, vigour, and deftness. Many old classical students will be delighted <lb/>
            to renew acquaintance with the comedy in Mr. Rogers's brilliant pages."- <lb/>
