          <p>'THE FROGS' of Aristophanes has always been a favourite <lb/>
            play with scholars of every age, and in the present day it is <lb/>
            a favourite still; probably because its plot is literary rather than <lb/>
            political. The study of history can hardly make us competent <lb/>
            to form an opinion of really great value upon the politics of <lb/>
            Athens at any particular period. History is untrustworthy, for <lb/>
            it is always the narrative of partisans, and therefore unsatis­ <lb/>
            factory material for the formation of an impartial judgement <lb/>
            upon characters that have passed away more than two thousand <lb/>
            years ago. But we are able to criticize the productions of the <lb/>
            characters represented in this play, for these live now, and will <lb/>
            live for ever. We may form and express an opinion on their <lb/>
            merits, with some amount of confidence that our estimate is <lb/>
            not unreasonable. By a careful study of the seven extant plays <lb/>
            of Aeschylus and the nineteen extant plays of Euripides, we <lb/>
            can qualify ourselves to pronounce a more or less justifiable <lb/>
            verdict upon them, or at least to appreciate the criticisms <lb/>
            expressed in this Play.</p>
          <p>The Frogs was first produced in January, 405 B. c. Its <lb/>
            success was so complete that it was accorded the unusual <lb/>
            honour of being acted a second time. The play, as it has <lb/>
            come down to us, bears evidence of revision and alteration <lb/>
            before its second performance: in some passages we have the <lb/>
            words of the two editions side by side. It is impossible to <lb/>
            decide between them, and the play is little the worse for the <lb/>
            inclusion of the two versions. In 405 B. c. the condition of <lb/>
            Athens was all but desperate. Ever since the year 431 she. <lb/>
            had been at war with Sparta for the position of leading power <lb/>
            in Greece, and the Spartans had as allies nearly all the Greek <note type="footnote"> A2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="4"/>
            states. Athenian victories were outnumbered by Athenian <lb/>
            defeats. Although the city itself was never actually besieged, <lb/>
            its environs were constantly devastated, five invasions of Attica <lb/>
            occurring in seven years. The countryfolk were driven into <lb/>
            the town, which in its over-crowded condition was ravaged by <lb/>
            the plague in 430 and 427. More than twenty-five per cent. of <lb/>
            the population perished, and demoralisation and disaffection <lb/>
            were rife among the survivors. In 415 an ill-fated and badly­ <lb/>
            conducted expedition to Sicily resulted in the loss of three <lb/>
            generals and about 50,000 men. In 411 a revolution sub­ <lb/>
            stituting an oligarchy, with a governing body of 400, for the <lb/>
            long-established democracy, was successful for a few months, <lb/>
            its time of office being fruitful in proscriptions and assassina­ <lb/>
            tions. During these times of unrest there were but few years <lb/>
            that were not saddened by severe disasters in the field, and <lb/>
            when, in 406, a bright gleam of hope was afforded by the <lb/>
            crushing defeat of the Spartan navy at Arginusae (a battle <lb/>
            often mentioned in this play), the city's joy was immediately <lb/>
            turned into mourning. Owing to stormy weather, no attempt <lb/>
            was successfully made to rescue the crews of disabled vessels, <lb/>
            or to recover the dead. Six admirals were tried and con­ <lb/>
            demned to death for real or supposed neglect, and almost <lb/>
            immediately public opinion underwent a complete change, and <lb/>
            five of their chief accusers were tried and condemned for <lb/>
            causing these admirals' fate. To a house so divided against <lb/>
            itself it seemed useless to offer political advice through the <lb/>
            customary channel of comedy, by the representation of a wholly <lb/>
            political drama like The Acharnians, or The Knights, and <lb/>
            Aristophanes grasped the situation. When every man's mind <lb/>
            was full of the war—full to overflowing—he met this state of <lb/>
            things by, at least nominally, ignoring it, and aimed at divert­ <lb/>
            ing his countrymen's thoughts for a time from their desperate <lb/>
            condition to the question of the relative merits of two dead <lb/>
            poets. It is true that in two striking passages (lines 686-705 <lb/>
             <pb n="5"/>
            and 717-737) he gives counsel of a kind which he knew to be <lb/>
            unpopular, but felt to be necessary; and he was probably <lb/>
            surprised to find that his hearers so strongly approved of this <lb/>
            counsel that they demanded a repetition of the play, but it <lb/>
            cannot be said that he made a serious attempt to use the <lb/>
            occasion to save his country: nor is this to his discredit. The <lb/>
            Frogs did nothing to avert the doom of Athens, because <lb/>
            nothing could avert it. The ‘ political catechizing' in Act II, <lb/>
            Scene iii, is so trivial that it could hardly have been intended <lb/>
            to create the impression of influencing an umpire's decision in <lb/>
            any way. The general opinion, which Aristophanes shared, is <lb/>
            probably well expressed by the lines assigned to Aeschylus <lb/>
            (lines 1458, 1459)</p>
          <p>Then how can any one save such a state</p>
          <p>Which wants a coat that's neither thick nor thin? <lb/>
            The rival poets give their scanty advice in a spirit of hopeless­ <lb/>
            ness, almost a spirit of foreboding. In about a year after this <lb/>
            play was produced Athens had surrendered.</p>
          <p>If Aristophanes had hoped that this could be prevented, he <lb/>
            would have given us something very unlike The Frogs, and <lb/>
            therefore Athens' loss has been posterity's gain.</p>
          <p>The contest between Aeschylus and Euripides suggests an <lb/>
            interesting question. Did Aristophanes intend to criticize <lb/>
            impartially the merits of the rival poets, or merely to reproduce <lb/>
            the style of criticism adopted by their respective admirers? <lb/>
            His treatment of Euripides is certainly representative of his <lb/>
            own opinions, except in the 'Scales' Scene (lines 1378-1410), <lb/>
            which can hardly have been intended to be taken seriously, <lb/>
            and is rather a piece of transparent tomfoolery. And perhaps <lb/>
            we may be justified in concluding that his admiration for <lb/>
            Aeschylus is no mere blind worship, as the censures of Euripi­ <lb/>
            des are often echoed by Dionysus in a way that suggests that <lb/>
            Aristophanes is not wholly unprepared to admit their justice. <lb/>
            If Homer himself sometimes nodded, it was not to be wondered <lb/>
             <pb n="6"/>
            at if the most Homeric of all poets followed suit. Perhaps <lb/>
            our author considered that his admission of the existence of <lb/>
            blemishes in his favourite poet would give more weight to the <lb/>
            profound admiration he generally expresses for all his writings, <lb/>
            just as the worthiest admirers of Tennyson are not those who <lb/>
            profess an unintelligent adoration of his every line, but those <lb/>
            who are not so dazzled by the glorious splendour of his work <lb/>
            as to be able to endure without protest the vapid vulgarity of <lb/>
            Lady Clara Vere de Vere, or the inane drivel of Edward <lb/>
            Gray.</p>
          <p>It is rather the effect which their works produced upon the <lb/>
            national character that seems to Aristophanes the really im­ <lb/>
            portant question. He was undoubtedly a favourable specimen <lb/>
            of the well-educated Athenian—not by any means a bigoted <lb/>
            Tory, for his own words show constant approval of Liberal <lb/>
            measures-and he may be considered as expressing in this play <lb/>
            the general estimate of the result of the teaching of the two <lb/>
            poets. His opposition to Socrates was free from bitterness. <lb/>
            He was on friendly terms with the greatest of philosophers, in <lb/>
            spite of being a violent, or at least an earnest, opponent of his <lb/>
            teaching. But with regard to Euripides, things are very differ­ <lb/>
            ent. Aristophanes can find no redeeming point in the poet or <lb/>
            his poetry. He simply hates him with all his heart, and thinks <lb/>
            that evil must result from every word he writes. Nor does he <lb/>
            judge him unread: for he seems to have every play at his <lb/>
            fingers' ends so thoroughly that he must have studied his <lb/>
            author most minutely, and his unsparing condemnation seems <lb/>
            to be perfectly genuine. He felt it his duty to do all he could <lb/>
            to counteract the increasing influence of Euripides upon the <lb/>
            rising generation, and knowing the power of ridicule, he em­ <lb/>
            ploys this weapon constantly and mercilessly; but he is careful <lb/>
            not to injure his own cause by exaggerated caricature, which <lb/>
            might have created sympathy for the object of his censure. <lb/>
            He would have every one consider Euripides a bad man and <lb/>
             <pb n="7"/>
            a bad poet. If he can induce people to believe the latter, he <lb/>
            hopes they will believe the former, and morality will be the <lb/>
            gainer. Without deliberately resolving to do evil that good <lb/>
            might come, he acted in accordance with this principle, and <lb/>
            even those who have no admiration for Euripides, either as <lb/>
            a man or as a poet, must in fairness admit that Aristophanes <lb/>
            has been unjust to him in both characters.</p>
          <p>I have made no attempt to reproduce the many expletives <lb/>
            which occur, the average being about one in every 22 lines. <lb/>
            Efforts have been made, with little success, to distinguish be­ <lb/>
            tween ‘ by Zeus!' (the commonest of oaths) and ‘ by Apollo! <lb/>
            ‘by Poseidon !’, &amp;c. They were all probably as meaningless <lb/>
            as similar expressions in common use among us, and had lost <lb/>
            all trace of their original significations as completely as ' 0 <lb/>
            dear!' (0 Dieu !), ‘ Dear me!' (Dio mio !), and other more <lb/>
            vulgar invocations of the Deity. The difficulty of finding suit­ <lb/>
            able equivalents has in my case been increased by many years, <lb/>
            residence in country villages, far from the universities and <lb/>
            polite society.</p>
          <p>In Greek comedy the audience consisted of males only, and <lb/>
            considerable licence was given to the author in respect of what <lb/>
            we rightly consider indecency, both in the subjects and in <lb/>
            language. There is but little of this in The Frogs, and I have <lb/>
            ventured to reproduce it all in my translation, toning it down <lb/>
            as little as possible. My readers will see that this play com­ <lb/>
            pares very favourably with the works of our poets of the <lb/>
            Restoration.</p>
          <p>The Frogs who give their name to this play are not, as they <lb/>
            are sometimes described, the chorus, or even ‘ a chorus’, but <lb/>
            merely a band of ghosts of departed Athenian frogs, who sing <lb/>
            songs while Charon and Dionysus are crossing the Stygian <lb/>
            waters, the refrain of these songs being a croaking which <lb/>
            Aristophanes represents by the words ‘ Brekekekex coax coax ’. <lb/>
            It is said by travellers that the Greek frogs actually utter a <lb/>
             <pb n="8"/>
            sound almost exactly like this at the present day. As English <lb/>
            frogs make a noise fairly resembling the word ‘ croak', I have <lb/>
            adopted this as the best available translation. To reproduce <lb/>
            the Greek sound is not to give the faintest impression of the <lb/>
            croaking of our own frogs.</p>
          <p>The true chorus consists of a company of the mystae or initiate. <lb/>
            They are the ‘ saved' in the next world. In their songs and <lb/>
            processional dances they imitate, without parodying, religious <lb/>
            ceremonies which they were accustomed to perform when alive <lb/>
            (see p. 94). English readers who are not familiar with classi­ <lb/>
            cal writing will be surprised at the prevalence of an element of <lb/>
            fun and amusement in the religion of the Greeks-but the <lb/>
            Greeks saw nothing incongruous in this. A heaven without <lb/>
            a ‘ merry noise' would have been no heaven to them. The <lb/>
            initiate hoped, as Sir Thomas More hoped, in his last letter to <lb/>
            his family, to 'meet merrilie in Heaven' (see line 453). But <lb/>
            Jews and Christians (Catholic and Protestant) have, with <lb/>
            scarcely any exceptions, frowned sternly upon any admixture of <lb/>
            levity with religion. To look for a joke in the Bible is to look <lb/>
            for a needle in a bundle of hay, to say nothing of the supposed <lb/>
            irreverence of such a proceeding. As to levity of conduct, <lb/>
            when Michal expressed her disgust at David's exaggerated <lb/>
            gestures while dancing before the Ark, we may feel sure that she <lb/>
            voiced the opinion of many of his subjects who disapproved of <lb/>
            his unjewish behaviour. No doubt David, in his sojourn <lb/>
            among the heathen Philistines, and perhaps also while he was <lb/>
            the outlawed chief of a band of disreputable riff-raff, had picked <lb/>
            up ideas and habits that were unintelligible and unacceptable <lb/>
            to the ordinary Jew, whose God inspired him with so much <lb/>
            fear; and on this occasion he seems to have conducted himself <lb/>
            in much the same way as the initiate (see lines 404-12 and <lb/>
            2 Samuel vi. 14, 16, 20 and 22).</p>
          <p>To take an illustration from Christian times, we find the <lb/>
            Council of Liftines, in 743, censuring in the strongest language, <lb/>
             <pb n="9"/>
            and absolutely forbidding, the taking part in such processions <lb/>
            as that just mentioned, in which the worshippers wore ' torn <lb/>
            clothes and split shoes', an attire that seems to be a survival <lb/>
            rather than a coincidence. And if, any connexion between <lb/>
            merriment and religion lasted on anywhere for some centuries, <lb/>
            it was held by the devout to be undesirable, and was finally <lb/>
            killed, in England at any rate, by Puritanism. But we must <lb/>
            realize that in Greece such a connexion prevailed, and met <lb/>
            with universal approval, if we are to understand and appreciate <lb/>
            the hymns and songs of the initiate.</p>
          <p>A Greek play was not, in theory at least, divided into acts <lb/>
            and scenes, but I have followed other translators in making <lb/>
            such a division, as being more convenient for English readers. <lb/>
            The lines are numbered as in the original.</p>
          <p>My translation, which is intended for general readers, is the <lb/>
            'Revised Version' of one which I began in 1870. An acting <lb/>
            edition was printed for private use, in 1895, at Leatherhead, <lb/>
            when a greatly abridged version of the play was performed at <lb/>
            St. John's School. The original MS. was mislaid by me for <lb/>
            some years, and discovered only in January last, when I had <lb/>
            rewritten nearly the whole play. I find that my former work <lb/>
            was by no means free from archaisms. These, in my opinion, <lb/>
            detract from the value of the otherwise admirable translations <lb/>

            twentieth century ought, I think, to use the ordinary language <lb/>

            <title type="sub">ARGUMENT OF THE PLAY</title>
          </ab>
          <p>The argument and substance of the play are as follows.</p>
          <p>The god Dionysus, being utterly disgusted with the degene­ <lb/>
            racy of the drama now that the three great masters are dead, <lb/>
            resolves to descend to the nether world and bring back thence <lb/>
            Euripides his favourite tragic poet. Attired as Heracles, and <lb/>
            attended by a slave Xanthias, he goes first to his brother <lb/>
            Heracles for instructions. Duly instructed, the pair make <lb/>
            their way to the infernal lake; Dionysus is ferried across it, <lb/>
            Xanthias goes round it, and after several amusing adventures <lb/>
            they come to the bright fields where the mystae, the initiated <lb/>
            of the Eleusinian mysteries, are enjoying their happiness. <lb/>
            Here they pause awhile and listen to the hymns of these <lb/>
            blessed spirits (who are the true chorus of the play), with <lb/>
            which are interspersed passages of political meaning and <lb/>
            personal satire. After this the chorus direct the travellers to <lb/>
            Pluto's house, at whose door they knock. Aeacus, who acts as <lb/>
            porter, receives the supposed Heracles with abuse and threats <lb/>
            of punishment for the theft of Cerberus. While he is gone for <lb/>
            assistance, Xanthias changes dress with Dionysus, but being <lb/>
            invited to a feast is forced by Dionysus to resign his borrowed <lb/>
            character, which, however, he is again persuaded to take when <lb/>
            two hostesses alarm the cowardly god with threats of retaliation. <lb/>
            At this point Aeacus returns with assistants and prepares to <lb/>
            arrest Xanthias, who denies his crime, and ingeniously offers his <lb/>
            slave Dionysus for examination by torture. Dionysus alarmed <lb/>
            pleads his divinity; and, when the proposed ordeal by scourg­ <lb/>
            ing fails to show which is the true god, they are taken indoors <lb/>
            to Pluto.</p>
          <p>This ends the first half of the play.</p>
          <p>The chorus counsel the state to use leniency towards <lb/>
             <pb n="12"/>
            bygone errors of citizens, and to employ the honest and noble <lb/>
            in place of the rascal demagogues.</p>
          <p>The second half of the play consists of the contest between <lb/>
            Aeschylus and Euripides, which ends in Aeschylus being <lb/>
            chosen.</p>
          <p>Aeacus and Xanthias return. The true Dionysus has been <lb/>
            discovered by Pluto and Proserpine. And his arrival proves <lb/>
            most timely; for Euripides is on the point of contesting the <lb/>
            tragic throne of the nether world with Aeschylus, and Dionysus <lb/>
            is just what they wanted-a judge.</p>
          <p>The competitors enter, and after mutual recriminations <lb/>
            inaugurate the contest by prayer and sacrifice. Euripides <lb/>
            pleads first, pointing out Aeschylus' faults of bombast, ob­ <lb/>
            scurity, mysterious marvels; and his own reforms in tragic art <lb/>
            by introducing clearness, common sense, smart dialogue. <lb/>
            Dionysus frequently interrupts, favouring Euripides, the speaker, <lb/>
            on the whole, but with some covert satire; while the Chorus <lb/>
            plainly show a preference for Aeschylus. Then Aeschylus <lb/>
            replies, stating that the mission of a poet is to ennoble his <lb/>
            audience; this he claims to have done by high heroic themes <lb/>
            treated grandly; whereas Euripides has chosen meaner sub­ <lb/>
            jects, spoken of crimes which should be left untold, and <lb/>
            encouraged quibbling argument rather than noble action. <lb/>
            Dionysus is somewhat won over to Aeschylus by this reply; <lb/>
            the chorus encourage the combatants to do their best.</p>
          <p>The prologues of the two poets are compared. Euripides <lb/>
            criticizes in detail one of his adversary's prologues, which he <lb/>
            blames as obscure and tautological. Aeschylus retorts on <lb/>
            those of Euripides, first finding fault with their sense, then <lb/>
            charging them all with a monotony in form and rhythm. In <lb/>
            this part of the contest Aeschylus is left with the last word and <lb/>
            the approval of Dionysus.</p>
          <p>Next they take each other's choruses. Exaggerated patch­ <lb/>
            work and parody are given by each from the other's lyrics, till <lb/>
             <pb n="13"/>
            Dionysus cries' Hold, enough !' to the sham Euripidean chorus. <lb/>
            Then Aeschylus proposes the test of weight. This is so <lb/>
            arranged that Aeschylus comes out superior in every case. <lb/>
            Yet Dionysus is so pleased with both that he is loth to offend <lb/>
            either. As, however, he must take one, or he will have had his <lb/>
            journey for nothing, and as he wants a poet for the public <lb/>
            good, he determines to make political wisdom the crucial test. <lb/>
            Both poets give their advice, on politics generally, and about <lb/>
            Alcibiades and some other citizens. The result is that <lb/>
            Dionysus chooses Aeschylus, to Euripides' surprise and indig­ <lb/>
            nation.</p>
          <p>They retire to a farewell banquet with Pluto, after which <lb/>
            Aeschylus is to be taken back to upper earth, Sophocles being <lb/>
            left to keep the tragic throne. The chorus light them in, <lb/>
            offering their congratulations, and auguring peace and pro­ <lb/>
            sperity for Athens.</p>

          <p>X. May I make some old joke, sir, of the sort <lb/>
            At which the audience never fail to laugh ?</p>
          <p>D. Yes, anything you like, except ‘I'm bruised <lb/>
            Keep clear of that, we've long been sick of it.</p>
          <p>X. Nothing else witty?</p>

          <p>D. Why, yes, <lb/>
            By all means, only mind you don't</p>
          <p>X. Don't what?</p>
          <p>D. Don't shift your yoke, and ask to ‘ leave the room</p>

            I get relieved, I shall relieve myself'. <lb n="10"/>
            </p>
          <p>D. Not till I say I'm going to be sick.</p>
          <p>X. Then why had I to carry all these traps, <lb/>
            If I do nothing that Ameipsias <lb/>
            And Phrynichus and Lycis always make <lb/>
            Their luggage-porters do upon the stage ? <lb n="15"/>

          <p>D. No, no! Please don't, for when I'm at the play, <lb/>

          <p>D. He's most impertinent, and vilely spoilt. <lb/>
            Here am I, Dionysus, son of... Cask, <lb/>
            Tramping on foot, and giving him a mount <lb/>
            To save his being tired and bearing weight.</p>
          <p>X. I bear it, don't I?</p>
          <p>D. Bear it, when you ride ? <lb n="25"/>
            </p>
          <p>X. Yes, bearing this.</p>
          <p>D. How?</p>
          <p>X. Well, it's hard to bear.</p>
          <p>D. But the ass, surely, bears the weight you bear.</p>
          <p>X. Not what I've got to bear, I swear he doesn't.</p>
          <p>D. How are you bearing, when you're being borne ?</p>
          <p>X. Can't say-but anyhow this shoulder's bruised. <lb n="30"/>
            </p>
          <p>D. Well, all I say is, if the ass don't help you, <lb/>
            You'd better give the ass a lift in turn.</p>
          <p>X. Oh, curse my luck in missing that sea-fight! <lb/>
            Wouldn't I just have made you howl for this!</p>
          <p>D. Get off, you scum! for though I've tramped on foot, <lb n="35"/>

          <p>H. Fought in the sea-fight ?</p>
          <p>D. Yes, and sank some ships, <lb/>
            Some twelve or thirteen of the enemy's. <lb n="50"/>

          <p>H. You two?</p>

          <p>H. I woke: it was a dream!</p>
          <p>D. Well, while on board, as I was all alone <lb/>
            And reading the Andromeda, a longing <lb/>
            Knocked at my heart, you can t conceive how hard</p>
          <p>H. Longing ? What size ?</p>

          <p>D. Hush! hush!</p>
          <p>H. Weren't you with Cleisthenes ?</p>
          <p>D. Dear boy, don't chaff me, for I'm really ill. <lb/>
            “ Such fierce desire is wasting me away."</p>
          <p>H. What sort, my little bruddie ?</p>

            </p>
          <p>D. Yes, and no man's dissuasion can prevent <lb/>
            My going after him.</p>
          <p>H. What? down below?</p>
          <p>D. Most certainly, or even down belower. <lb n="70"/>
            </p>
          <p>H. What for?</p>
          <p>D. I want a poet with some wits; <lb/>
            " Some are no more, and those we have are bad."</p>
          <p>H. There's Iophon alive.</p>
          <p>D. The one good thing <lb/>
            That's still remaining, if that's really good: <lb/>
            For I'm by no means certain that it is. <lb n="75"/>
            </p>
          <p>H. But if you must take somebody from there, <lb/>
            There Is Sophocles before Euripides.</p>
          <p>D. No! I must first get Iophon alone, <lb/>
            Apart from Sophocles, and try his metal: <lb/>
            Besides, Euripides is slim enough <lb n="80"/>
            To try to slip back here with me, but he <lb/>
            Is just as easy-going there as here.</p>
          <p>H. Where's Agathon ?</p>
          <p>D. He's left me: he is gone! <lb/>
            A genial poet, missed by all his friends.</p>
          <p>H. Gone? where?</p>
          <p>D. To sing ' the song of them that feast<lb n="85"/>
            </p>
          <p>H. But Xenocles?</p>
          <p>D. Oh, Xenocles be damned !</p>
          <p>H. Pythangelus?</p>
          <p>X. But where do I come in, <lb/>
            With my poor shoulder rawed so awfully ?</p>
          <p>H. But aren't there here a lot of bits of lads, <lb/>
            Who write ten-thousand tragedies and more, <lb n="90"/>
            And beat Euripides in talk by furlongs ?</p>
          <p>D. They're grapes that never ripen, jabbering things, <lb/>
            " Mere schools of swallows," ruiners of Art, <lb/>
            Who make one mild assault on Tragedy, <lb/>
             <pb n="21"/>
            Beget one play, and promptly disappear, <lb n="95"/>
            But a creative poet you won't find, <lb/>
            Look where you will, who'll speak a splendid line.</p>
          <p>H. Creative?</p>
          <p>D. Yes, creative; one who'll say <lb/>
            Some bold original idea like this:­ <lb/>
            " The air, God's bedroom," or " the foot of time <lb n="100"/>
            Or " Though my heart refused to swear the oath <lb/>
            My tongue swore falsely what my heart knew not ". <lb/>
            H. You like that?</p>
          <p>D. Like it ? I go mad with joy.</p>
          <p>H. I swear it's drivel, and you think so too.</p>
          <p>D. " Rule not my mind ” ; mind your own house instead. <lb n="105"/>
            </p>
          <p>H. Look here, it's plainly the most feeble stuff.</p>
          <p>D. Teach me to dine!</p>
          <p>X. But where do I come in ?</p>
          <p>D. Now for the reason why I wear this dress, <lb/>
            The same as yours: I've come to ask what friends <lb/>
            You stayed with (I might want to do the same), <lb n="110"/>
            When you went down to fetch up Cerberus. <lb/>
            Tell me about the ports, streets, bakers'-shops, <lb/>
            Wells, shelters, sidings, lodgings (double-beds <lb/>

            </p>
          <p>H. You daring chap! Have you the pluck to go ?</p>
          <p>D. No more of that, but tell me of the roads, <lb/>
            I want to know the quickest way to Hades, <lb/>
            And not a hot route nor a very cold.</p>
          <p>H. Let's see : which shall I tell you first, I wonder. <lb n="120"/>
            One way to go is by The Rope and Bench, <lb/>
            Just hang yourself.</p>
          <p>D. Stop, that's a stifling road.</p>
          <p>H. Then there's a path well beaten, a short cut, <lb/>
             <pb n="22"/>
            Go by the Mortar.</p>
          <p>D. Hemlock, I suppose.</p>
          <p>H. Just so.</p>
          <p>D. But that's a cold and wintry way. <lb n="125"/>
            Your shins get numbed the minute you set out.</p>
          <p>H. Well, would you try a quick and downhill, road ?</p>
          <p>D. I would: I'm not so very walkative.</p>
          <p>H. Just saunter down to Pot-land</p>
          <p>D. Yes, what next?</p>
          <p>H. Get to the top of that high tower</p>
          <p>D. And then? <lb n="130"/>
            </p>
          <p>H. Watch till you see the torch-race being started, <lb/>
            And when the lookers-on say ' Send them off!, <lb/>
            Send off yourself as welL</p>
          <p>D. Where?</p>
          <p>H. Down below!</p>
          <p>D. But I should waste a good two pounds of brains. <lb/>
            That's not the road I mean to go.</p>
          <p>H. What then? <lb n="135"/>
            </p>
          <p>D. The way you went.</p>
          <p>H. But there's a long sea trip, <lb/>
            For at the first you'll come to a huge lake, <lb/>
            All bottomless.</p>
          <p>D. Then how am I to cross ?</p>
          <p>H. There's an old sailor in a boat this size, <lb/>
            Who'll take you all the way across for threepence. <lb n="140"/>
            </p>
          <p>D. Oh, that ubiquitous Almighty Threepence ! <lb/>
            How did it get there ?</p>
          <p>H. Theseus introduced it. <lb/>
            Then you'll see snakes, and numberless wild beasts, <lb/>
            Most weird.</p>
          <p>D. Don't try to scare or frighten me: <lb/>
            You'll never stop me.</p>
          <p>H. Then a mass of mud <lb n="145"/>
             <pb n="23"/>
            And ever-flowing dung, in which they lie <lb/>
            Who ever wronged a stranger anywhere, <lb/>
            Or picked a pocket while they stole a kiss, <lb/>
            Or beat a mother, gave a father blows <lb/>
            Upon the cheek, committed perjury, <lb n="150"/>
            Or copied out a verse of Morsimus.</p>
          <p>D. You surely ought to add another line— <lb/>
             Or learnt the war dance of Cinesias.'</p>
          <p>H. Then all around you flutes shall breathe their sound, <lb/>
            And you'll see loveliest sunlight, like our own, <lb n="155"/>
            And myrtle-groves, and happy companies <lb/>
            Of men and women, making loud applause.</p>
          <p>D. Who are these people ?</p>
          <p>H. The Initiate</p>
          <p>X. I swear, then I'm the donkey in this show. <lb/>
            But there! (throws down the luggage) I won't stand any <lb/>

          <p>H. Who'll tell you anything you'ld like to know, <lb/>
            For they live close along the road itself, <lb/>
            Just at the very gates of Pluto's home. <lb/>
            Now lad ! Good-bye! Good luck.</p>
          <p>D. The same to you :</p>
          <p>Lots of good luck. (to XANTHIAS) Pick up those things <lb/>
            again. <lb n="165"/>

          <p>X. Beg pardon, sir, but can't you hire some man, <lb/>
            Some dead chap, coming here to take this trip ?</p>
          <p>D. If I can't find one ?</p>

          <p>D. All right. <lb/>

            Why, here's a funeral come just in time. <lb n="170"/>

            Nor seeks as he should the citizens' good, <lb/>

            And ate up sixteen loaves of ours.</p>

            Why, there I I've never mentioned all that fish.</p>
          <p>P. Dear, no! nor that fresh cheese, Oh drat the man ! <lb/>
            He ate the basket it was in, as well, <lb n="560"/>

            Down with the traps, you. Quick! and mind you tell <lb/>
            No lies.</p>
          <p>D. I warn all men that it's unlawful <lb/>
            To torture me who am immortal; else, <lb/>

          <p>X. Yes, I do. <lb/>

            All the more reason for his being flogged, <lb/>
            If he's a god, he'll never notice it.</p>
          <p>D. Well, come now, if you say that you're a god, <lb n="635"/>
            Why not take just as many blows as I ?</p>
          <p>X. That's fair enough. And now, the one you see <lb/>
            Cries out the first, or seems to mind the pain <lb/>
            Of beating, you may say he's not a god.</p>
          <p>AE. Well! I must say you are a gentleman. <lb n="640"/>
            You go straight in for justice. Strip now, both.</p>
          <p>X. How will you try us fairly ?</p>
          <p>AE. That's quite easy. <lb/>
            Hit one, then hit the other.</p>
          <p>X. That's all right.</p>
          <p>AE. There!</p>
          <p>X. Mind you notice if I wince at all.</p>
          <p>AE. I've hit you.</p>
          <p>X. That you haven't.</p>
          <p>AE. So it seems. <lb n="645"/>
            I'll go and hit the other. —</p>
          <p>D. Tell me when.</p>
          <p>AE. I've hit you.</p>
          <p>D. Did I sneeze ? I ought to have.</p>
          <p>AE. Can't say. I'll try the other man again.</p>
          <p>X. Be quick! It's awful.</p>
          <p>ME. Awful ? What ? the pain <lb n="650"/>
            I gave you ?</p>
          <p>X. No ! to think I can't tell when <lb/>
            My feast at Diomeia's coming off.</p>
          <p>AE. How truly pious ! Now the other man.</p>

          <p>D. I see some Cavalry.</p>

          <p>X. “Rid me of this thorn !”</p>

            To recollect one of Hipponax' hymns.</p>
          <p>X. You're doing nothing. Hit him in the ribs.</p>

          <p>It befits the sacred chorus on our city to bestow <lb/>
            Good advice and good instruction. First then, for we <lb/>
            hold it so, <lb/>
            Citizens should all be equal, terror's reign be done away, <lb/>
            And if any through the tricks of Phrynichus have gone <lb/>
            astray, <lb/>
            Those I say who've made a slip, should be allowed to <lb/>
            cancel all <lb n="690"/>
            Former errors, after showing what it was that caused their <lb/>
            fall. <lb/>
            Next, there's no man here should be deprived of citizens' <lb/>
            full rights ; <lb/>
            For 'tis hard if those who chance to fight in one of our <lb/>
            sea-fights <lb/>
            Should be changed from slaves to lords, and rank as the <lb/>
            Plataeans do; <lb/>
            Not that I'm at all inclined to say that this is wrong of <lb/>
            you. <lb n="695"/>
            No! I praise you: this one thing, and this alone, your <lb/>

            But, besides, those men who've often fought with you <lb/>
            against your foes, <lb/>
            And their fathers too before them, men who are your kith <lb/>
            and kin, <lb/>
            Should be pardoned, as they beg, for this their one and <lb/>
            only sin. <lb/>

            excites, <lb/>
            While, amid the rolling waves, the ship of state is in distress, <lb/>
            We shall find some day that all men call our wisdom <lb/>

          <p>CHORUS-LEADER.</p>
          <p>It has very often struck us that our State behaves the same <lb/>
            To those citizens of ours who best of all deserve the name <lb/>
            As to our old-fashioned coinage and the gold of recent <lb/>
            date; <lb n="720"/>
            For we've ceased to use the finest coinage found in any <lb/>
            State <lb/>
            Unalloyed and undebased, and stamped with dies that <lb/>
            none excel, <lb/>
            (Such at least is our opinion) ringing clear as any bell, <lb/>
            Coins that pass among the Greeks and foreigners where'er <lb/>
            they be; <lb/>
            No, instead of these we've got this wretched copper <lb/>
            novelty, <lb n="725"/>
             <pb n="46"/>
            Coined a day or two ago, and stamped with a most shabby <lb/>
            die. <lb/>
            So, the men whose birth is noble, and whose character is <lb/>
            high, <lb/>
            Upright men, who nought unworthy of a gentleman would <lb/>
            do, <lb/>
            Men who've learnt the noblest training of the mind and <lb/>
            body too, <lb/>
            These we slight; but red-haired slaves and strangers of <lb/>
            the brassy breed, <lb n="730"/>
            Base in birth and base in nature, we employ for every <lb/>
            need, <lb/>
            These we trust, these last arrivals, fellows such as this our <lb/>
            State <lb/>
            To employ for very scapegoats once would gravely hesitate. <lb/>
            Come then, 0 you foolish people, lay your evil ways aside; <lb/>
            Use the useful once again, for if success this change <lb/>

            Great your gain, while if you make a slip, all men of sense <lb/>
            will see, <lb/>

            Why then I simply ... can't contain myself.</p>
          <p>X. My word ! give me your hand, let's shake, and kiss <lb n="755"/>
            Like brothers ! and do tell me, by the God <lb/>
            Who's patron of such jailbirds as us two, <lb/>
            What's all this noise indoors and quarrelling <lb/>
            And shouts ?</p>
          <p>AE. Euripides and Aeschylus ...</p>
          <p>X. Ah!</p>
          <p>AE. There's a great, a very great, to-do <lb/>
            Among the dead, a regular revolt. <lb n="760"/>
            </p>
          <p>X. Why?</p>
          <p>AE. Well, we've got a law in force down here <lb/>
            That the best man among the candidates, <lb/>
            Out of all arts accounted great and high, <lb/>
            Shall dine for nothing in the Public Hall, <lb/>
            And have a seat next Pluto . . .</p>
          <p>X. Ah, I see! <lb n="765"/>
            </p>
          <p>AE. Until some other who's a better man <lb/>
            Arrives, and then the first gives up his place.</p>
          <p>X. How could this inconvenience Aeschylus ?</p>
          <p>AE. You see, he held the throne of Tragedy, <lb/>
             <pb n="48"/>
            As best Tragedian?</p>
          <p>X. Well, who has it now ? <lb n="770"/>
            </p>
          <p>AE. Why, when Euripides arrived, he gave <lb/>
            Lectures to parricides and pickpockets <lb/>
            And thieves and burglars (we've a tidy lot <lb/>
            Of such folk here), and when they heard his turns <lb n="775"/>
            And twists, and tricks of argument, they all <lb/>
            Went worse than mad, and voted him the best, <lb/>
            And he got so conceited that he claimed <lb/>
            The throne from Aeschylus ...</p>
          <p>X. And so got pelted ?</p>
          <p>AE. Lord ! no. The folk cried out to try the case, <lb/>
            And see which of them was the better man. <lb n="780"/>
            </p>
          <p>X. The blackguard-folk?</p>
          <p>AE. Lord ! yes. They split the sky.</p>
          <p>X. Had Aeschylus no friends to back him up ?</p>
          <p>AE. " What's good is scarce." It's just the same as here. <lb/>
            (pointing to the audience)</p>
          <p>X. Then what does Pluto now propose to do ?</p>
          <p>AE. To hold at once a contest and a trial, <lb n="785"/>
            And test the skill of each.</p>
          <p>X. But tell me why <lb/>
            The throne was never claimed by Sophocles.</p>
          <p>AE. By him ? Why, there ! as soon as he came down, <lb/>
            He just kissed Aeschylus, and shook his hand <lb/>
            And never thought of claiming it. But now <lb n="790"/>
            He means, according to Cleidemides, <lb/>
            To ‘ wait and see'. If Aeschylus should win <lb/>
            He'll do no more, but if Euripides, <lb/>
            For art's sake, he must fight it to the death.</p>
          <p>X. Will it come off?</p>
          <p>AE. It will, and pretty soon. <lb n="795"/>
            And then such wonders will be started here! <lb/>
            They're going to weigh poetry in scales.</p><pb n="49"/>
            
          <p>X. What's that ? treat tragedy like joints of meat ?</p>
          <p>AE. And bring out rules and rods to measure lines, <lb/>
            And pattern-moulds,</p>
          <p>X. What ? going to make bricks ? <lb n="800"/>
            </p>
          <p>.AE. And squares and wedges, for Euripides <lb/>
            Says he shall test their dramas verse by verse.</p>
          <p>X. That's hard for Aeschylus to bear, I'm sure.</p>
          <p>AE. " E'en as a baited bull his brows he bent."</p>
          <p>X. Who's to be judge then ?</p>
          <p>AE. That was hard to say, <lb n="805"/>
            Since cultivated men were scarce, they found; <lb/>
            For Aeschylus and Athens weren't on terms.</p>
          <p>X. Such lots of burglars, I suppose he thought.</p>
          <p>AE. But 'twas a farce, he held, for other folk <lb/>
            To judge of poets' brains ; so now they've asked <lb n="810"/>
            Your master, as experienced in the art. <lb/>
            But let's go in, for when our lords are keen <lb/>
            On any thing, we may look out for squalls. (Exeunt.)</p>
          <p>CH. Surely a mighty storm of passion <lb/>
            Will in the loud-thunderer's heart hold sway, <lb/>
            When he catches a glimpse of his sharp-tongued foe, <lb n="815"/>
            Eagerly whetting his tusks for the fray; <lb/>
            Then will his eyes roll to and fro, <lb/>
            In frenzy's wild terrific fashion. <lb/>
            Words will be bristling like plumes in fight <lb/>
            On the glancing helms, when fierce is the strife, <lb/>
            And splinters whirl off left and right, <lb/>
            And fairest works are hacked by the knife, <lb/>
            As the poor soul parries the words of might, <lb n="820"/>
            That draw from a master-mind their life. <lb/>
            For shaking the neck that is covered all o'er <lb/>
            With a rugged, shaggy, bristling mane <lb/>
            And frowning fierce, he will utter a roar, <lb/>
            Hurling huge jointed words again and again, <note type="footnote"> D </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="50"/>
            As though great planks asunder he tore, <lb/>
            While he pants like a mighty giant in pain. <lb n="825"/>
            Then that critic of verse, a tongue sharp and keen, <lb/>
            That speaks from the lips and not from the heart, <lb/>
            Writhing and champing the bit, in its spleen, <lb/>
            Shall range words together and set them apart, <lb/>
            And vast though the toil of the lungs has been, <lb/>

          <p>EURIPIDES. I won't give up the throne; don't talk of it: <lb n="830"/>
            I say I'm his superior in our art.</p>
          <p>DIONYSUS. Why silent, Aeschylus ? you hear his words.</p>
          <p>EU. He'll first assume an air of grand reserve; <lb/>
            It's an old trick of his in all his plays.</p>

            </p>
          <p>EU. I know him ! I saw through him long ago, <lb/>
            The poet of the savage, stubborn-mouthed; <lb/>
            His tongue knows nought of curb, restraint, or check. <lb/>
            What's argument to him, big bag of swagger?</p>
          <p>AESCHYLUS. " Indeed ? you son of the " greengrocer " goddess ” ! <lb/>

          <p>D. Excuse me, highly honoured Aeschylus! <lb/>
            Out of the way, you poor Euripides ! <lb/>
            Avoid the hailstorm, if you've any sense, <lb/>
            Lest with some topping word he strike your head <lb/>

            Don't lose your temper, Aeschylus, but calmly <lb/>
            Test, or be tested. Poets can't indulge <lb/>
            In virulent abuse, like bakers' wives. <lb/>
            You start by roaring like a blazing log.</p>
          <p>EU. I'm ready, and I won't back out of it, <lb n="860"/>
            To cut up, or to let him cut up first <lb/>
            The verses, songs, and sinews of my plays, <lb/>

            </p>
          <p>AE. I had no wish for any contest here, <lb/>
            For we don't meet on equal terms.</p>
          <p>D. How's that?</p>

            Still, if you think it right, it must be done. <lb n="870"/>

            Is to hear the way in which you two, <lb/>
            A clever couple, mean to fight. <lb/>
            Your tongues are sharpened for the fray, <lb/>
            Your pluck's unflinching, and your wits <lb/>
            Are fired with rivalry, so 'tis right <lb/>
            To think the one will make some hits <lb n="900"/>
            In a shrewd and polished way; <lb/>
            Whilst the other will on him fall <lb/>
            Tearing words up, root and all, <lb/>
            And the subtle lines confound <lb/>
            That throng his foeman's wrestling-ground.</p>

          <p>EU. As for myself, whatever are my merits as a poet <lb/>
            I'll tell you last, but first I say of him, and mean to show it,. <lb/>
            He fooled and gulled the audience : with cheating tricks <lb/>
            he caught them, <lb/>
            Whose wits were none the brightest after Phrynichus had <lb/>
            taught them. <lb n="910"/>
            For at the start, upon the stage he'ld set some muffled <lb/>
            creature, <lb/>
            Achilles, say, or Niobe—you never saw a feature- <lb/>
            A trick to hide the play's weak points, — and not one <lb/>
            grunt they muttered.</p>
          <p>D. No more they did.</p>
          <p>EU. Meanwhile the chorus hammered on, and uttered <lb/>
            Four songs or so on end, the actors silent still remaining,</p>
          <p>D. I liked their silence, and I thought it quite as enter­ <lb/>
            taining <lb n="916"/>
            As nowadays the talk is.</p>
          <p>EU. You were dull of comprehension: <lb/>
            That's clear.</p>
          <p>D. No doubt I was, but what was what's-his-name's in­ <lb/>
            tention ?</p>
          <p>EU. 'Twas just a dodge to make the audience quietly sit <lb/>
            heeding <lb/>
            What Niobe was going to say — the play meanwhile <lb/>
            proceeding. <lb n="920"/>
            </p>
          <p>D. The villain that he is! and how he took me in completely! <lb/>
            What makes you fret and fume ?</p>
          <p>EU. Because I show him up so neatly. <lb/>
            Then after all this fooling, when the play was half com­ <lb/>
            pleted, <lb/>
            The actor, roaring like a bull, some dozen words repeated <lb/>
            Made up of " plumes " and " eyebrows ", ghostly sounds, <lb/>
            enought to haunt you, <lb n="925"/>

          <p>EU. Not one intelligible word</p>
          <p>D. Do keep your teeth from gnashing!</p>
          <p>EU. But " fosses " or " Scamanders ", or " weird griffin-eagles, <lb/>
            flashing " <lb/>
            From " brass-wrought work on targes ", and huge beetling­ <lb/>
            cliff-like twaddle <lb/>
            That seemed to make small sense.</p>
          <p>D. Hear! hear! I know my poor old noddle <lb n="930"/>
            Ached all one night—I got no sleep, by ceaseless thought <lb/>
            tormented <lb/>
            As to what sort of bird the "tawny cock-horse" represented.</p>
          <p>AE. 'Twas a ship's painted figure-head, you dullest of dull <lb/>
            creatures!</p>
          <p>D. How like Philoxenus's chick Eryxis in its features !</p>
          <p>EU. D'you think, in writing plays, a cock's a help to inspi­ <lb/>
            ration ? <lb n="935"/>
            </p>
          <p>AE. You God-forsaken fool, let's hear the works of your <lb/>
            creation.</p>
          <p>EU. Mine? not “cock-horses”—not “goat-stags”, like yours, <lb/>
            you may be certain; <lb/>
            The sort of things embroidered on some Persian hanging­ <lb/>
            curtain. <lb/>
            But when I took our Art in hand, and found you'd left her <lb/>
            swelling <lb/>
            And crammed with turgid style, and words whose weight <lb/>
            was past all telling, <lb n="940"/>
            I started thinning diet, and reduced her gross condition <lb/>
            By verselets, little walks, white beet, and by the exhibition <lb/>
            Of small-talk juice;—’twas from my books that I distilled <lb/>
            this factor ;- <lb/>
            Then fed her up with Solos,</p>
          <p>D. (aside) Plus Cephisophon, your actor!</p><pb n="55"/>
            
          <p>EU. Nor trifled with chance subjects, nor mixed all in muddling <lb/>
            mystery. <lb n="945"/>
            But when the play began, the actor sketched at once the <lb/>
            history <lb/>
            Of all the plot.</p>
          <p>D. (aside) Your history would less well bear narration.</p>
          <p>EU. Then from the first no character was void of occupation; <lb/>
            All had to talk; the wife, the slave, the lord, alike were <lb/>
            treated; <lb/>
            The girl, the crone, all just the same.</p>
          <p>AE. Were justice duly meted <lb n="950"/>
            You would have died for such a crime.</p>
          <p>EU. There, there! no need to halloa: <lb/>
            I wrote as a sound Liberal.</p>
          <p>D. Come, come! you didn't follow <lb/>
            The straightest line in politics : let's hear no mor e about it.</p>
          <p>EU. And then I taught these folk to talk.</p>
          <p>AE. Yes! nobody could doubt it. <lb/>
            And if you'd burst in two instead, the better for our nation.</p>
          <p>EU. Then subtle rules I brought, and squares for metre­ <lb/>
            regulation. <lb n="956"/>
            They learnt to think, see, understand, pervert, contrive <lb/>
            dissension, <lb/>
            Think evil, question everything.</p>
          <p>AE. True I such was your intention.</p>
          <p>EU. I dealt with scenes in which we live and move and have <lb/>
            our being, <lb/>

            Since 'tis fated that I to him must reply: <lb/>
            Should he say, then, no answer I've got, <lb/>
            Come tell me, I pray, for what do you say a poet deserves <lb/>
            admiration ?</p>
          <p>Eu. If his counsel be wise, if he soundly advise, and so make <lb/>
            the men of our nation <lb/>
            Better men than they were.</p>
          <p>AE. Then if you had no share in doing the things you have <lb/>
            said, <lb n="1010"/>
            But when they were good, and such as men should be, you <lb/>
            turned them out worthless instead, <lb/>
            What penalty, pray, do you think you should pay ?</p>
          <p>D. Don't ask him ! why, death's the right thing.</p>
          <p>AE. See now what they were when, fresh from my care, he first <lb/>
            took them under his wing; <lb/>
             <pb n="58"/>
            Tall gallant and good sixfooters they stood, not cowardly <lb/>
            mean duty-shirkers, <lb/>
            Not lubberly louts, not the humbugging touts of to-day, <lb/>
            nor yet villainy-workers; <lb n="1015"/>
            And the joys of their heart were the spear and the dart, <lb/>
            and the helm with its white waving crest, <lb/>
            And the greave and the axe; and they met all attacks with <lb/>
            a seven-ox-hide-covered breast.</p>
          <p>EU. I knew it! our bane is upon us again! Those helmets! <lb/>
            my head will be broke !</p>
          <p>D. And what was the way in which, as you say, you made <lb/>
            them such excellent folk ? <lb/>
            Come, Aeschylus, come! don't be sullen and dumb with <lb/>
            stubborn and angry disdain. <lb n="1020"/>
            </p>
          <p>AE. By my play all aflame with battle.</p>
          <p>D. Its name ?</p>
          <p>AE. I The Knights of the Theban campaign , <lb/>
            Which all who have heard have felt their heart stirred with <lb/>
            a longing to rush on the foe.</p>
          <p>D. Well, that was in fact a villainous act, for you've taught all <lb/>
            the Thebans to grow <lb/>
            More manly by far when they meet us in war, for which <lb/>
            a good hiding's your due.</p>
          <p>AE. But you might have been taught, like them, and you <lb/>
            ought,-but you paid no attention thereto. <lb n="1025"/>
            Then ‘The Persians' I brought on the stage, and I <lb/>
            wrought in all minds an enthralling desire <lb/>
            To conquer the foe, making noble deeds glow still brighter <lb/>
            by poesy's fire.</p>
          <p>D. That's all very well, when they came on to tell of Darius's <lb/>
            death, I must say <lb/>
            I was glad he was dead, but the chorus instead beat their <lb/>
            hands thus, and cried ‘Well-a-day!'</p><pb n="59"/>
            
          <p>AE. Aye, such are the things your true poet sings, for ask of <lb/>
            the days that are gone, <lb n="1030"/>
            What help for our needs has come from the deeds the <lb/>
            noblest of poets have done. <lb/>
            'Twas Orpheus who taught us religion, and brought us to <lb/>
            keep from all bloodshedding ways, <lb/>
            And Musaeus revealed how disease should be healed, and <lb/>
            made oracles plain to our gaze. <lb/>
            Did not Hesiod show how to plough, reap, and sow, and <lb/>
            Homer the godlike, whence sprang <lb/>
            The honour and fame that encompass his name? From <lb/>
            the fact that the songs which he sang <lb n="1035"/>
            Taught warriors to fight, march, arm them aright.</p>
          <p>D. Well, Pantocles, clumsiest lout, <lb/>
            Didn't learn it, you know, for a few days ago, when the <lb/>
            Festival-Guard was marched out, <lb/>
            He clapped his helm straight on the top of his pate, and <lb/>
            then wanted to fix on the crest.</p>
          <p>AE. But he taught others many, as stout hearts as any, brave <lb/>
            Lamachus one of the best, <lb/>
            The moulds by whose use my mind would produce grand <lb/>
            deeds that my lion-heart folk <lb n="1040"/>
            My Teucers might do, my Patrocluses too, our country­ <lb/>
            men's hearts to provoke <lb/>
            To a standard as high to aspire, when the cry of the war­ <lb/>
            trumpet calls to the fray. <lb/>
            But, by Heaven above! Sthenoboea's lewd love, or <lb/>
            Phaedra's, I scorned to portray <lb/>
            And nobody says that in one of my plays a passion­ <lb/>
            swayed woman you'll see.</p>
          <p>EU. That's certainly true, for passion and you were strangers.</p>
          <p>AE. And long may we be ! <lb n="1045"/>
            But passion on you, and your home-circle too, swooped <lb/>
            down with such terrible force <lb/>
             <pb n="60"/>
            That she soon laid you low.</p>
          <p>D. By Heaven, that's so ! we know it, we know it, of <lb/>
            course! <lb/>
            What you wrote of the lives of other men's wives is simply <lb/>
            what happened to you.</p>
          <p>EU. Tell me, fool, your ideas about my Sthenoboeas, what <lb/>
            harm to the state do they do ?</p>
          <p>AE. Why, honest men's wives, who had lived honest lives, took <lb/>
            poison,—you taught them to do it,- <lb n="1050"/>
            And died with foul shame disgracing their name: your <lb/>
            Bellerophon-folk drove them to it.</p>
          <p>EU. You surely don't hold that the tale which I told of <lb/>
            Phaedra was really untrue ?</p>
          <p>AE. No ! true as could be; but my point is that we should <lb/>
            hide what is bad out of view, <lb/>
            And not bring it out and parade it about, for whereas little <lb/>
            children at school <lb/>
            Must always obey what an elder may say, over adults the <lb/>
            poet bears rule. <lb n="1055"/>
            We are bound to teach men what is useful.</p>
          <p>EU. If then Lycabettus is one of your themes, <lb/>
            Or again if you write of Parnassus's height, you ‘teach <lb/>
            what is useful', it seems. <lb/>
            You certainly should talk just as men would.</p>
          <p>AE. Poor critic, you surely must see <lb/>
            That words born of great thought and sentiment ought as <lb/>
            noble an offspring to be. <lb/>
            Besides, reason teaches that demigods' speeches need <lb/>
            language exceeding our powers, <lb n="1060"/>
            For this we confess, when we clothe them in dress far <lb/>
            grander than ours. <lb/>
            When such things, through me, were as right as could be, <lb/>
            you ruined it all.</p>
          <p>EU. In what way ?</p><pb n="61"/>
            
          <p>AE. First, you wrapped up your kings in shabby old things, so <lb/>
            that people who went to the play <lb/>
            Might think what they wanted was pity.</p>
          <p>EU. Well, granted. What harm do you say that I've <lb/>
            done ?</p>
          <p>AE. Why, out of the lot of rich men that we've got, we can't <lb/>
            raise a trierarch! not one ! <lb n="1065"/>
            But in rags each appears, and bursts into tears, and swears <lb/>
            that he hasn't a groat.</p>
          <p>D. You're right! It's quite true ! but he's decent clothes too, <lb/>
            underneath, and a warm woolly coat, <lb/>
            And if by this plea he gets off, why, you'll see he pops up <lb/>
            in the Fishmarket quick.</p>
          <p>AE. Then you taught them to chatter on every matter, and <lb/>
            learn every gossiping trick, <lb/>
            Till we never can meet with a single athlete, and our boys <lb/>
            to their school-benches stick<lb n="1070"/>
            With worn-out behinds, and gossip-fed minds; and even <lb/>
            our sailors are told <lb/>
            To argue if they need orders obey, but in my days, the <lb/>
            brave days of old, <lb/>
            They knew nothing at all except just to bawl for their <lb/>
            rations, and sing out 1 Heave-ho!'</p>
          <p>D. And their scorn to display in the filthiest way for the poor <lb/>
            lubbers rowing below, <lb/>
            And play some foul joke on a messmate, and poke their <lb/>
            hands in folk's pockets ashore. <lb n="1075"/>
            But now they all argue, and simply won't row, <lb/>
            Aimlessly pottering to and fro.</p>
          <p>AE. But is there a wrong he hasn't wrought, <lb/>
            Who on our stage vile panders brought, <lb/>
            Women their brothers marrying, <lb n="1080"/>
            Women in temples travailing, <lb/>
            And deeming death and life one thing ? <lb/>
             <pb n="62"/>
            And so our land has grown to be <lb/>
            Full of an under-clerkling crew, <lb/>
            And vulgar-mouthed mob-monkeys too, <lb n="1085"/>
            Cheating our folk incessantly. <lb/>
            And in the Torch-race, there's not one, <lb/>
            Through want of training, fit to run.</p>
          <p>D. That's true, I'll swear ! I know that I <lb/>
            Last Panathenaea, got quite dry <lb/>
            With laughing, when I saw a man, <lb n="1090"/>
            A fat, pale, lazy chap, who ran <lb/>
            Bending double, coming in last, <lb/>
            In terrible trouble; and, as he passed, <lb/>
            The Potterfolk at the gates began <lb/>
            To smack his paunch, ribs, sides, and stern, <lb/>
            Till their slaps made him sick of the whole concern, <lb/>
            So at last his pent-up steam found vent, <lb n="1096"/>
            And puffed out the torch!-and away he went.</p>
          <p>CHORUS.</p>
          <p>Great is the matter, vast is the strife, fierce is the war that's <lb/>
            now beginning. <lb/>

            </p>
          <p>D. Now the next line; and, you, look out for faults.</p>
          <p>AE. " Be thou my Saviour, help me when I call, <lb/>
            For hither am I come, and do return."</p>
          <p>EU. Wise Aeschylus has said the same thing twice :</p>
          <p>D. How twice?</p>
          <p>EU. You mark the words ; I'll quote you them, <lb/>
            " Here am I come," he says, " and do return”. <lb n="1156"/>
            " Am come " is just the same as " do return</p>
          <p>D. Yes, just like asking any one to lend <lb/>
            A trough to knead in, and a kneading-trough.</p>
          <p>AE. Far from it! You have talked away your wits <lb n="1160"/>
            Into stupidity. They're perfect lines.</p>
          <p>D. How so ? Please tell me how you make that out.</p>
          <p>AE. When some one has a right to come, we say <lb/>
            He comes, apart from anything besides. <lb/>
            An exile, now, returns as well as comes.</p><pb n="65"/>
            
          <p>D. That's splendid ! What say you, Euripides? <lb n="1165"/>
            </p>
          <p>Eu. Orestes, I assert, did not return, <lb/>
            He came back on the sly, without permission.</p>
          <p>D. That's good!—(aside) although I don't know what you <lb/>
            mean.</p>
          <p>EU. Now for another line.</p>
          <p>D. Yes, say some more, <lb n="1170"/>
            Quick, Aeschylus; and you see what's amiss.</p>
          <p>AE. " And on this barrow, I beseech my sire <lb/>
            To hear and hearken."</p>
          <p>EU. Same thing twice, again: <lb/>
            To “hear”, and “hearken”, clearly just the same.</p>
          <p>D. 'Twas to the dead he spoke, you silly man. <lb n="1175"/>
            We call three times, and yet can't make them hear.</p>
          <p>AE. But what about your prologues ?</p>
          <p>EU. You shall hear. <lb/>
            If I repeat myself, or load my lines <lb/>
            With needless padding, you may spit on me!</p>
          <p>D. Quick then! Begin ! I simply yearn to hear <lb n="1180"/>
            The perfect measure of your prologues' lines.</p>
          <p>EU. " A happy man at first was Oedipus."</p>
          <p>AE. Not he, I swear ! for he was born unhappy. <lb/>
            Why, when he wasn't born, Apollo said <lb/>
            He'ld kill his father—yes ! before his birth: <lb n="1185"/>

            In winter, they exposed him in a crock, <lb n="1190"/>
            To stop his growing up to kill his father, <lb/>
            And then he limped to Poly bus-and doom, <lb/>
            Lamed in both legs, then married an old crone, <lb/>
            While he was young—’twas his own mother too, <lb/>
            Then poked his eyes out. <note type="footnote"> E </note> <pb n="66"/>

          <p>Eu. Nonsense! I think my prologues excellent.</p>
          <p>AE. Look here, now ! I won't cut your lines to bits <lb/>
            Verse after verse, but heaven helping me, <lb/>
            I'll spoil your prologues with a little flask. <lb n="1200"/>

            This little flask will blow a hurricane.</p>

            Buy it from him ?</p>

            You'll get a downright beauty for three half-pence.</p>

            They damp the fleeces, so he damped his verse. <lb/>
            But you put in a verse with wings to it.</p>
          <p>EU. Well, let him say one more, and weigh against me.</p><pb n="73"/>
            
          <p>D. Take hold again, then.</p>
          <p>AE AND EU. So we have.</p>
          <p>D. Say on! <lb n="1390"/>
            </p>
          <p>EU. " Persuasion hath no other shrine than speech."</p>
          <p>AE. " The only God men cannot bribe is Death."</p>
          <p>D. Let go ! Let go! Down goes his scale again. <lb/>
            He put in Death, the heaviest of ills.</p>
          <p>EU. But I Persuasion, a most perfect line. <lb n="1395"/>
            </p>
          <p>D. Persuasion is a light and senseless thing: <lb/>
            But look out some one of your heavy lines, <lb/>
            To weigh down well, a great and mighty one.</p>
          <p>EU. Where have I such a verse ?</p>
          <p>D. I'll tell you one:­ <lb/>
            " Achilles threw two aces and a four." <lb n="1400"/>
            Say on ! for this is the last chance you have.</p>
          <p>EU. " His right hand grasped an iron-weighted club."</p>
          <p>AE. " Chariot on chariot heaped, and corpse on corpse."</p>
          <p>D. He's done you once again this time.</p>
          <p>EU. But how?</p>
          <p>D. He put two chariots and two corpses in. <lb n="1405"/>
            A hundred men of Egypt couldn't lift them.</p>
          <p>AE. There ! no more verse for verse ! let him get in <lb/>
            Himself, his children, wife, Cephisophon, <lb/>
            Jump in, sit down, and take his books as well, <lb/>
            And I'll say just a couple of my lines. <lb n="1410"/>
            (Enter PLUTO.)</p>
          <p>D. The men are friends of mine: I won't decide, <lb/>
            For I won't be at enmity with either. <lb/>
            I think the one is wise : I like the other.</p>
          <p>PLUTO. Then you'll do nothing that you came to do ?</p>
          <p>D. But if I do decide?</p>
          <p>P. Take one, and go. <lb n="1415"/>
            The one you choose; or else you came in vain.</p>
          <p>D. Thank you so much. Now, both of you attend. <lb/>
             <pb n="74"/>
            I came down here to fetch a poet.</p>
          <p>EU. Why?</p>
          <p>D. To save our state, and let it act its plays. <lb/>
            Whichever then shall give advice that's sure <lb n="1420"/>
            To help our state, that man I mean to take. <lb/>
            First, what you think of Alcibiades <lb/>
            Each tell me, for the state is in sore labour.</p>
          <p>EU. But what's her own opinion of him ?</p>
          <p>D. What? <lb/>
            " She loves, yet hates him ”—but she wants to have him. <lb/>
            But you must tell me what you think of him. <lb n="1426"/>
            </p>
          <p>EU. I hate a man who to his land shall seem <lb/>
            Slow to do good, but swift to do much harm, <lb/>
            Helpful to self, but helpless to his state.</p>
          <p>D. That's good I swear! Now (to AESCHYLUS) your opinion, <lb/>
            please. <lb n="1430"/>
            </p>
          <p>AE. No lion cub you in your state should rear. <lb/>
            Far best to rear no lion in your state, <lb/>
            But, if you rear one, let him have his way.</p>
          <p>D. By all that's helpful! I am much perplexed. <lb/>
            For one speaks cleverly, the other clearly. <lb/>
            But give me your opinion once again; <lb n="1435"/>
            What plan of safety have you for the state ?</p>
          <p>EU. Tie to Cleocritus Cinesias <lb/>
            For wings; then winds could waft them out to sea.</p>
          <p>D. That would be fun, but what's the sense of it ?</p>
          <p>EU. If a sea-fight came off, they might have cruets <lb n="1440"/>
            Of vinegar to shower in our foe's eyes. <lb/>
            I've an idea I'ld like to tell.</p>
          <p>D. Tell on.</p>
          <p>EU. When we put trust in what we now mistrust, <lb/>
            Mistrusting what we trust.</p>
          <p>D. What do you mean ? <lb/>
            Say something rather stupider but clearer. <lb n="1445"/>
            </p><pb n="75"/>
            
          <p>EU. If then we should mistrust those citizens <lb/>
            In whom we now put trust, and use those men <lb/>
            Whom now we do not use, we might be saved. <lb/>
            If now we have ill luck with these, reversing <lb/>
            Our present policy should surely save us. <lb n="1450"/>
            </p>
          <p>D. " A Palamedes 0 what clever wits !” <lb/>
            Was this your notion, or Cephisophon's ?</p>
          <p>EU. My own idea: the vinegar was his.</p>
          <p>D. (to AESCHYLUS) Now your views, please.</p>
          <p>AE. First tell me of the state: <lb/>
            Whom does she use ? Good men ?</p>
          <p>D. Why, what a question! <lb n="1455"/>
            She hates them bitterly.</p>
          <p>AE. And likes the bad ?</p>
          <p>D. Not she ! she uses them because she must.</p>
          <p>AE. " Then how can any one save such a state," <lb/>
            Which wants a coat that's neither thick nor thin ?</p>
          <p>D. Find out, if you come back again some day. <lb n="1460"/>
            </p>
          <p>AE. There I could tell you, here I'ld rather not.</p>
          <p>D. O don't say that! send up what's good from here.</p>
          <p>AE. When they shall hold the country of their foes <lb/>
            To be their own, and their own land the foe's, <lb/>
            The ships as income, income as outgoing, <lb n="1465"/>
            </p>
          <p>D. Good, but that feeds none but the juryman!</p>
          <p>P. Won't you decide ?</p>
          <p>D. I'll give my verdict thus :— <lb/>
            " Him will I choose in whom my soul delights.”</p>
          <p>EU. Remember now the Gods by whom you swore. <lb/>
            You'ld surely take me home, and choose your friend. <lb n="1470"/>
            </p>
          <p>D. " My tongue hath sworn, but ” . . . Aeschylus I'll choose.</p>
          <p>EU. What have you done, most vile of men ?</p>
          <p>D. What? I ? <lb/>
            I've given Aeschylus the prize. Why not ?</p>
          <p>EU. What! do such wrong and look me in the face ?</p><pb n="76"/>
            
          <p>D. " What's wrong, unless the " audience " think it so ? ” <lb n="1475"/>
            </p>
          <p>EU. What! cruel wretch ! look on and leave me dead ?</p>
          <p>D. " Who knows if life is nothing else but death," <lb/>
            Breathing a breakfast, sleep a nappy quilt ?</p>
          <p>P. Come in now, both, please, Dionysus.</p>
          <p>D. Why ?</p>
          <p>P. To be my guests before you start. <lb n="1480"/>
            </p>
          <p>D. Good news! <lb/>
            I know I don't object to such a plan.</p>
          <p>CHORUS. How happy is the man of sense <lb/>
            And accurate intelligence. <lb/>
            This may by many proofs be learned, <lb/>
            For by good sense this man has earned <lb n="1485"/>
            The right to go back home again, <lb/>
            A blessing to his countrymen, <lb/>
            A blessing to his kith and kin, <lb/>
            Such privilege could wisdom win. <lb n="1490"/>
            And so, the proper way to please <lb/>
            Is not to sit with Socrates, <lb/>
            And learn to chatter, passing by <lb/>
            The science of true poetry, <lb/>
            And giving up the grandest part <lb/>
            Of tragedy's ennobling art; <lb n="1495"/>
            For idly wasting all one's days <lb/>
            In learning words of grand pretence, <lb/>
            And scraps of philosophic craze, <lb/>
            Proclaims a man bereft of sense.</p>

            And bid them make haste, every man, <lb/>

            With Adeimantus, the son of White-feather.</p>

            Let Sophocles take it, and sit thereon <lb/>
            To keep it for me, in case some day <lb/>
            I come here again, for he, I say, <lb/>
            In our art is the next to me. <lb/>
            But mind that master of villainy, <lb n="1520"/>
            False-tongued and full of buffoonery, <lb/>
            Never once my seat may fill, <lb/>
            No, not even against his will.</p>
          <p>P. Kindle the holy torches' ray <lb/>
            And lead him upwards on his way. <lb/>
            With tune and metre alike his own, <lb n="1525"/>
            Let all honour be duly done.</p>

          <p>DIONYSUS, who appears in this play disguised, as he thinks, as <lb/>
            Heracles, wears a woman's yellow dress and slippers, under a lion- <lb/>
            skin, and carries a heavy club. He is the typical Athenian 'man-in­ <lb/>
            the-street', hardly less ignorant than such characters in our own <lb/>
            country, and quite as ready to give his worthless opinion upon <lb/>
            every subject. His slave bears the common slave-name Xanthias <lb/>
            (i. e. ‘Sandy' or ‘ Carrots'), derived from the colour of his hair.</p>
          <p>3. The jokes made for the amusement of the' Gallery, which are <lb/>
            here ridiculed, were very commonly employed by comedians, and <lb/>
            not rarely by Aristophanes himself.</p>
          <p>14. Phrynichus, a contemporary comedian, gained the Second <lb/>
            prize against the Frogs, and Ameipsias the First prize against the <lb/>
            Birds, and the Second against the Clouds. Lycis is unknown.</p>
          <p>22. 4 Son of ... Cask' (or wine-jar), an unexpected substitute for <lb/>
            Son of Zeus. Dionysus was the God of Wine.</p>
          <p>25-30. These lines are a skit upon the quibbling disputations <lb/>
            common among the disciples of the Sophists.</p>
          <p>33. ' That sea-fight.' The battle of Arginusae, in which slaves <lb/>
            were employed as well as citizens, and rewarded with their freedom.</p>
          <p>48. Cleisthenes, see below, 1. 428, is frequently satirized by <lb/>
            Aristophanes for his vice and effeminacy. Nothing else is known <lb/>
            about him.</p>
          <p>52. The Andromeda by Euripides, produced in 412 B. C., has not <lb/>
            survived. It was considered one of his finest tragedies.</p>
          <p>55. Melon is said to have been a tragic actor of great size.</p>
          <p>73. Iophon, son of Sophocles, a successful tragedian, appears <lb/>
            from this passage to have owed some of his success to his produc­ <lb/>
            ing works of Sophocles as his own. Not long before his father's <lb/>
            death, he was afraid that he would be disinherited in favour of his <lb/>
            nephew, Sophocles the younger, and tried to prove in Court that his <lb/>
            father was of unsound mind; but to meet the charge, Sophocles <lb/>
            merely read a passage from his latest work, Oedipus at Colonus, <lb/>
             <pb n="80"/>
            which had not yet been produced, and at once gained the day. <lb/>
            Sophocles, at the age of 27, defeated Aeschylus, in 468 B.C., <lb/>
            winning the first prize for tragedy, and held the stage till 441, when <lb/>
            he was defeated by Euripides. Only seven of his 130 plays are <lb/>
            extant: many critics consider them to be the finest dramatic pro­ <lb/>
            ductions in the Greek language. He died at the age of 90, the <lb/>
            year before the Frogs was acted.</p>
          <p>83. Agathon, the tragedian, was highly esteemed by Socrates <lb/>
            and Plato. His first success was in 416. He was celebrated for <lb/>
            his beauty, but is satirized by Aristophanes, in the Thesmophoria­ <lb/>
            zusae, for his effeminacy, and is said to have left Athens for the <lb/>
            Court of King Aechelaus of Macedon in 407, immediately after our <lb/>
            author attacked him in the Gerytades (now lost).</p>
          <p>86. Xenocles, the smallest of an undersized family, defeated <lb/>
            Euripides in 415. He is ridiculed by Aristophanes in other plays, <lb/>
            and by other comedians.</p>
          <p>87. Pythangelus, of whom nothing is known, has had ‘2,500 <lb/>
            years of immortality', as Professor Gilbert Murray puts it, owing to <lb/>
            this mention of his name.</p>
          <p>100. These expressions, so much admired by Dionysus, occur in <lb/>
            three of Euripides' plays :- The Melanippe, the Alexander, and <lb/>
            the Hippolytus.</p>
          <p>124. Compulsory suicide, by hemlock-drinking, was a common <lb/>
            form of execution at Athens.</p>
          <p>128. Words with a termination equivalent to -live were largely <lb/>
            employed in the philosophical jargon of the day, and are common <lb/>
            in Plato's works. In the Knights (1.1378, &amp;c.) we find 6 quoted in <lb/>
            three lines, provoking the suggestion ' Can't you be kickative of <lb/>
            the talkative ?’ [This last word, compounded of the only Lithua­ <lb/>
            nian word in our language (see Skeat) and Latin, is at least as <lb/>
            barbarous as 'walkative</p>
          <p>129. The Cerameicus, or Potters' Quarter of Athens, was the <lb/>
            scene of the Torch-races (see 1. 1091). The high tower is said to <lb/>
            have been built by the celebrated misanthrope, Timon of Athens.</p>
          <p>134. Dionysus, with perhaps mock humility, calls the two lobes <lb/>
            of his brain ' a couple of rissoles'.</p>
          <p>140. The proper fare was I½d., but the war had made things so <lb/>
            much dearer that to go to Hades cost as much as to go to the Play, <lb/>
             <pb n="81"/>
            Charon's boat was proverbially small: Heracles suggests that he <lb/>
            could hold it in one hand.</p>
          <p>142. Theseus, the hero of the Athenian constitution, visited Hades <lb/>
            with Peirithous to carry off Persephone, but was imprisoned there <lb/>
            till Heracles rescued him. He seems to have parted with some <lb/>
            threepenny-pieces during his imprisonment.</p>
          <p>151. Morsimus the oculist, a relative of Aeschylus, is ridiculed <lb/>
            elsewhere by Aristophanes as a most inferior tragedian.</p>
          <p>153. Cinesias, mentioned again 1. 367, was an inferior dithy­ <lb/>
            rambic poet of the innovating school of music, noted for his spindle <lb/>
            shanks and feeble body. He is criticized unfavourably by four <lb/>
            other writers, including Plato.</p>
          <p>159. Xanthias says that the joys just mentioned by Heracles will <lb/>
            be about as much joy to him as a donkey feels when he walks in a <lb/>
            procession, heavily laden.</p>
          <p>178. The dead man naturally substitutes sooner would I live! <lb/>
            for ‘ sooner would I die!'</p>
          <p>184. Dionysus hails Charon with a pun on his name, repeated <lb/>
            three times, which cannot well be rendered into English.</p>
          <p>186. Asses’-Shearington=the land of Nowhere. A cavern at <lb/>
            Taenarum, S.W. of Laconia, was supposed to be one of the entrances <lb/>
            of Hades. Charon's question may mean, Who's for Hell or Sparta? <lb/>
            they're the same thing.'</p>
          <p>191. 'To gain his freedom' (see 11. 33, 693) is possibly the mean­ <lb/>
            ing of an expression about which commentators have written a <lb/>
            great deal that is not very convincing.</p>
          <p>194. Xanthias has so small an opinion of Charon's rowing that <lb/>
            he expects to get round the lake before the boat gets across it.</p>
          <p>196. Xanthias refers to some harbinger of ill-omen that must <lb/>
            have crossed his path unnoticed.</p>
          <p>204. The men of Salamis, separated from Attica by only a few <lb/>
            miles of sea, were noted for their seamanship.</p>
          <p>215. Nysa was apparently a name given to any mountain on <lb/>
            which Dionysus was worshipped, in any country in the world.</p>
          <p>218. See p. 95.</p>
          <p>232. The bridge of the lyre was often made of reed.</p>
          <p>251. Dionysus has probably altered a terrifying shout or yell by <lb/>
            way of parodying the croaking of the Frogs. (See 1. 262.) <note type="footnote"> F </note> <pb n="82"/>
            </p>
          <p>272. Xanthias, though he has got there first, has lost his wind.</p>
          <p>293. The Greek Bogey was able to change into all sorts of things. <lb/>
            Her mule's (or donkey's) leg, which seems to have outlasted her <lb/>
            changes on this occasion, is described by Xanthias with a slave's <lb/>
            natural coarseness.</p>
          <p>297. The Priest of Dionysus sat in the middle of the front row <lb/>
            of the stalls, as we should call them. It is really Aristophanes <lb/>
            himself who thus tells the Priest that he hopes to win the prize for <lb/>
            his play, and come to the supper which the Priest gave to the <lb/>
            successful competitors after the performance.</p>
          <p>303. Hegelochus, while acting the name-part in Euripides' play <lb/>
            Orestes (1. 279), mispronounced the word that means ‘calm' and <lb/>
            turned it into the equivalent of weasel’. I have used ' weasel for <lb/>
            ‘we shall' in my translation.</p>
          <p>318. See p. 94.</p>
          <p>320. In this line the reading is very uncertain. I follow the <lb/>
            interpretation of Professor Tucker, in his edition of this play, <lb/>
            published in 1906.</p>
          <p>338. Pigs were sacrificed at the mysteries.</p>
          <p>357. Cratinus (here called the ‘beef-eater', a title properly <lb/>
            belonging to Dionysus himself), a most successful poet of the Old <lb/>
            Comedy, who defeated Aristophanes in his 96th year (423), is <lb/>
            satirized by our author and others for his drunken habits, but <lb/>
            praised most highly for his productions.</p>
          <p>363. Aegina, about 12 miles from the coast of Attica, though a <lb/>
            very small island, was once an important state. Since 431 it had <lb/>
            belonged to Athens, and was occupied by Athenians, the native <lb/>
            population being expelled.</p>
          <p>Thorycion (see 1. 381) is nowhere else mentioned.</p>
          <p>364. Epidaurus, the nearest port opposite Aegina, was a station <lb/>
            of the Peloponnesian fleet in 411. Perhaps the treacherous <lb/>
            smuggling here mentioned began then, and was continued till the <lb/>
            date of this play.</p>
          <p>367. Little shrines, statues, and emblems of Hecate were placed <lb/>
            at many of the crossways. The person here referred to is probably <lb/>
            Cinesias (see 1. 153).</p>
          <p>378. ' The Saviour' was a common title of Persephone. She, <lb/>
            Demeter, and Iacchus were the deities of these mysteries.</p><pb n="83"/>
            
          <p>404. The ‘ torn clothes and split shoes' were the proper dress <lb/>
            for those taking part in these processions. They were not neces­ <lb/>
            sarily old and ludicrous, and it is probable that Aristophanes does <lb/>
            not really mean, as some suppose, that his chorus is shabbily dressed.</p>
          <p>416. (See p. 94.) Archedemus 1the sore-eyed' (see 1. 588) was <lb/>
            the originator of the prosecution of the Admirals after Arginusae. <lb/>
            He was guilty of embezzlement and bribery, but is here attacked <lb/>
            as not being a genuine Athenian. The Marquess of Salisbury's <lb/>
            sneer at ‘ the black man' represents very fairly the attitude of <lb/>
            Aristophanes and the majority of the Athenians towards aliens <lb/>
            (see 1. 679). There is a poor and impossible pun in the next line <lb/>
            in the original.</p>
          <p>428. Cleistbenes' lover Sebinus has a name which may be real, <lb/>
            but its meaning is so grossly indecent that it is probably altered <lb/>
            for the purpose of ridicule, like Hippobinus (really Hipponicus) in <lb/>
            the next line.</p>
          <p>429. Callias, who wasted an immense fortune in debauchery, <lb/>
            appears in the Birds as a hoopoe with hardly a feather left him, <lb/>
            after being plucked by toadies and harlots.</p>
          <p>463. Aeacus, who here acts as Pluto's door-keeper, and later on <lb/>
            shows himself to be a rascally slave, was, according to the popular <lb/>
            theology, one of the judges in Hades. His speech is said to be <lb/>
            parodied from a tragedy of Euripides, in which it is addressed to <lb/>
            Heracles. The ‘ lamprey of Tartessus', here made so terrible, was <lb/>
            a great dainty. The ‘ Gorgons of Teithras' are the women of one <lb/>
            of the demes (or districts) of Attica.</p>
          <p>501. ' Melite's... bad lot' is a surprise for ' Melite's great hero*; <lb/>
            Heracles had a temple here.</p>
          <p>541. Theramenes (see 1. 968) has the character of being a trimmer <lb/>
            in politics. After Arginusae, where he commanded a ship, he <lb/>
            appears to have escaped prosecution by accusing his colleagues. <lb/>
            Aristotle calls him an admirable statesman, but his fellow-citizens <lb/>
            called him ‘ the boot that fits either foot</p>
          <p>549. Rogers tells us that the Greek dentists of later date called <lb/>
            a row of teeth a ' chorus ’.</p>
          <p>556. There is some humour in the suggestion that Dionysus, in <lb/>
            the character of Heracles, thought he had disguised himself success­ <lb/>
            fully by wearing ladies' shoes. <note type="footnote"> F2 </note> <pb n="84"/>
             </p>
          <p>567. The ‘ rugs' here mentioned were used as bedding.</p>
          <p>569. Cleon, a rich tanner, is represented by Aristophanes and <lb/>
            Thucydides as a vulgar and brutal demagogue. He was, in the <lb/>
            early years of the war, a strong opponent of peace, and in 425 his <lb/>
            popularity with the lower class was greatly increased by his <lb/>
            taking prisoner a body of Spartans, many of them being of high <lb/>
            birth, in the island of Sphacteria, which had been blockaded <lb/>
            fruitlessly for some months. His success was largely due to the <lb/>
            accidental burning of the woods on the island. He was thus <lb/>
            enabled to fulfil his boast that, if he were general, he would take <lb/>
            the place within a few days. He fell in battle three years later. <lb/>
            Aristophanes, whom he attempted to deprive of his rights of <lb/>
            citizenship, attacks him on every possible occasion, and wrote the <lb/>
            Knights on purpose to injure him in his public character, but <lb/>
            without much success. He is here represented as being patron or <lb/>
            protector of the lower orders in Hades, as he had been on earth. <lb/>
            Grote and other radical writers think that his contemporaries have <lb/>
            grossly slandered him.</p>
          <p>570. Hyperbolus, a lampseller, attacked also in the Knights, <lb/>
            was a demagogue of the same type. He was ostracised and went <lb/>
            to Samos, where he was murdered by his political enemies <lb/>
            in 411.</p>
          <p>574. The Pit was a ravine outside Athens into which criminals <lb/>
            and the dead bodies of executed persons were thrown.</p>
          <p>587. Dionysus' wife and family are of course imaginary.</p>
          <p>608. Aeacus calls three Scythian archers (policemen) to help the <lb/>
            two slaves for whom Xanthias with his club has proved too much. <lb/>
            The police in Athens appear to have been always foreigners (see <lb/>
            1. 1356) and generally Scythians.</p>
          <p>615. Xanthias turns the tables on Dionysus, who is enjoying his <lb/>
            discomfiture, by availing himself of the right to offer his slave for <lb/>
            torture, to prove the falseness of the charge of misdoings on <lb/>
            a former occasion.</p>
          <p>621. It was usual to ask that no undue severity might be <lb/>
            employed. Xanthias asks that there may be no undue lenity.</p>
          <p>646. Dionysus, in his pretended unconcern at the blow, 'goes <lb/>
            one better' than Xanthias, and asks, 'At what o'clock do you <lb/>
            mean to begin ?’ No explanation of his question about his sneezing <lb/>
             <pb n="85"/>
            is satisfactory. We simply don't know what it means, and may as <lb/>
            well say so.</p>
          <p>650. The festival of Heracles at Diomeia had not been kept for <lb/>
            a long time, owing to the occupation of Attica by the enemy.</p>
          <p>654. The cavalry (knights) when on service carried their pro­ <lb/>
            visions, including onions, themselves. Dionysus, pointing to the <lb/>
            knights in the audience, says, 4 These men have brought their <lb/>
            onions with them.'</p>
          <p>657. Xanthias makes his cry of pain change into a quotation, <lb/>
            probably from Sophocles' play Odysseus Acanthoplex, in which the <lb/>
            hero is dangerously wounded by a spine-fish.</p>
          <p>659. Dionysus follows suit with a similarly-used quotation from <lb/>
            Ananius, his attempt to remember the words of Hipponax being <lb/>
            unsuccessful. This quotation was probably most familiar to all <lb/>
            the audience, and Dionysus' mistake is something like crediting <lb/>
            Longfellow with some well-known verses of Tennyson's. The two <lb/>
            Greek poets were contemporaries (about 540).</p>
          <p>665. This passage is said to occur in Sophocles' Laocoon, and to <lb/>
            be incorrectly quoted.</p>
          <p>678. Cleophon, a demagogue of the most offensive type, and the <lb/>
            most violent opponent of peace on all occasions, is here attacked <lb/>
            not for his faults, but for his un-Athenian origin, as Archedemus <lb/>
            was (see 1. 416).</p>
          <p>684. The meaning of this line is not perfectly clear, but the <lb/>
            prophecy came true. He was murdered before the year was ended.</p>
          <p>689. The Phrynichus here mentioned was an important factor <lb/>
            in the revolution of 411, by which the oligarchy of the 400 was <lb/>
            established. After four months it was overthrown, and its supporters <lb/>
            disfranchised. This passage led to their restoration, at the end of <lb/>
            the year, to citizenship, and this speech of the Chorus secured the <lb/>
            first prize for Aristophanes.</p>
          <p>693. After Plataea was destroyed (427) by the Peloponnesians, <lb/>
            its citizens were rewarded for their long loyalty to Athens by being <lb/>
            made Athenian citizens with full rights.</p>
          <p>708. Cleigenes is nowhere else mentioned. The soap supplied <lb/>
            by the ‘ Lords of Cimolia' was a clay used for this purpose, which <lb/>
            they appear to have adulterated with cheap and inferior substances. <lb/>
            Cimolia is one of the Cyclades.</p><pb n="86"/>
            
          <p>718. The copper or bronze coinage which is here considered to <lb/>
            be the type of the alien, inferior, and vulgar politicians and officials <lb/>
            of the day, had been almost literally ‘ coined a day or two ago' <lb/>
            and contrasted most unfavourably with the 'old-fashioned coinage' <lb/>
            of silver, and the 4 gold of recent date', both of which, as may be <lb/>
            seen from existing specimens, were of exceptional excellence. <lb/>
            The old coins probably represent the good old Tories, middle-aged <lb/>
            or elderly, and the new gold the younger men who followed in <lb/>
            their footsteps, and were not, in Aristophanes' opinion, adulterated <lb/>
            by the philosophy of the Sophists or the ' radical' innovations of <lb/>
            the favourites of the mob.</p>
          <p>733. Two 4 scapegoats a man and a woman, generally criminals <lb/>
            of the worst kind, were scourged out of the city and put to death <lb/>
            at the festival of the Phargelia in May, to take away the sins of <lb/>
            the nation.</p>
          <p>737. An optimistic proverb says that to be hanged on a goodly <lb/>
            tree is better than being hanged on an inferior one.</p>
          <p>745. Aeacus compares his feelings to those of the highest rank <lb/>
            of the Initiate, who were as absolutely certain of salvation as some <lb/>
            of our 4 converted people.</p>
          <p>756. ' Patron of jailbirds' is a surprise for A patron of brother­ <lb/>
            hood • or ‘ kinship'.</p>
          <p>758. Aeschylus (525-456), author of seventy plays of which <lb/>
            seven are extant, won the first prize for tragedy in 484. Being <lb/>
            defeated by Sophocles in 468, he retired to the court of King Hiero <lb/>
            of Syracuse. Ten years later he was in Athens for a short time, <lb/>
            and produced the Agamemnon, Choephoroe, and Eumenides. He <lb/>
            died in Sicily two years later. He improved tragedy by intro­ <lb/>
            ducing a second actor and making dialogue possible, and by <lb/>
            using better scenery and costumes. The grandeur of his style is <lb/>
            unequalled, but the criticisms of Euripides in this play scarcely <lb/>
            exaggerate his grandiloquence and obscurity.</p>
          <p>764. Citizens who rendered conspicuous services to the state <lb/>
            were similarly honoured at Athens.</p>
          <p>791. Cleidemides, of whom nothing is known, is supposed to <lb/>
            have been an actor in Sophocles' tragedies, or a politician given <lb/>
            to 'sitting on the fence '.</p>
          <p>799. There is here an allusion to the mechanical accuracy and <lb/>
             <pb n="87"/>
            minute regularity of Euripides' verses compared with the more <lb/>
            rugged style of Aeschylus.</p>
          <p>807. Professor Tucker is probably right in holding that this <lb/>
            refers to the political views of Aeschylus, which were aristo­ <lb/>
            cratical.</p>
          <p>813. This chorus, describing the character of the coming battle, <lb/>
            seems to consist of parody, imitation, and quotation. It foretells <lb/>
            a contest between strength and subtlety.</p>
          <p>837. Euripides' charge against Aeschylus, of introducing 'savages' <lb/>
            in his plays, is met by the counter-charge of introducing ‘ beggars' <lb/>
            and cripples’.</p>
          <p>840. With the exception of the word ' greengrocer' this line is <lb/>
            one of Euripides' own.</p>
          <p>847. The sacrifice of a black lamb was customary to avert <lb/>
            a threatening storm.</p>
          <p>849. Euripides, in two plays dealing with Crete, introduced <lb/>
            love-songs dealing with unholy passion, about which he wrote also <lb/>
            in his Aeolus and other dramas.</p>
          <p>854. A ' topping' word probably means one that hits you on the <lb/>
            top of the head.</p>
          <p>855. ' Telephus' is put as a surprise for brains. Euripides <lb/>
            evidently considered this play as the finest work of his brain.</p>
          <p>868. Aeschylus' plays, he says, have outlived him, and are still <lb/>
            in the world above.</p>
          <p>871. On such occasions as the present trial, 'the proceedings <lb/>
            were opened with prayer.'</p>
          <p>886. Aeschylus, born at Eleusis, and initiated into the Mysteries, <lb/>
            claims the patronage of Demeter.</p>
          <p>890. The reference here is to the contemptible 'new coinage' <lb/>
            (see 1. 725).</p>
          <p>910. The Phrynichus here mentioned is the poet (see 11. 14 <lb/>
            and 1299).</p>
          <p>918. Dionysus, vexed at having wrongly admired Aeschylus' <lb/>
            treatment of dumb characters, now pettily and spitefully calls him <lb/>
            ' What's-his-name ?'</p>
          <p>925. Euripides charges Aeschylus with using big noisy words <lb/>
            and descriptions of war with its ' Death-or-Glory-Boys' and their <lb/>
            accoutrements and heraldic devices and crests.</p><pb n="88"/>
            
          <p>932. This bird, who appears in other plays of Aristophanes, is <lb/>
            supposed to be a macaw, a cockatoo, or a turkey-cock.</p>
          <p>939. Tragedy is here represented by Euripides as an over­ <lb/>
            corpulent lady, whom he, as physician, attended with beneficial <lb/>
            results.</p>
          <p>944. Cephisophon, an actor who lived with Euripides, was said <lb/>
            to have helped him with his plays (see I. 1438), and seduced his <lb/>
            wife (see 1. 1048).</p>
          <p>952. Euripides' profession of Liberalism appears to have been <lb/>
            insincere, if he ever made it outside this play, which is unlikely.</p>
          <p>963. Cycnus and Memnon were demigods who fought on Priam's <lb/>
            side in the Trojan war.</p>
          <p>965. Megaenetus is unknown. His nickname may have been <lb/>
            something like ‘ the Ninepin'. In the game called Cottabos, a small <lb/>
            bronze statuette was called by this nickname of his. Phormisius <lb/>
            was evidently a much-bearded and moustached man. A bearer of <lb/>
            this name was an honest politician of the old school, who came <lb/>
            into prominence at the time of the fall of Athens (403).</p>
          <p>966. The robber Sinis used to tie his prisoners to the bent-down <lb/>
            heads of two pine-trees, and let the trees fly up and tear the man <lb/>
            in two. He suffered the same fate at the hands of Theseus.</p>
          <p>967. Cleitophon was associated with Theramenes in the revolu­ <lb/>
            tion which led to the establishment of the Four Hundred (411). <lb/>
            Euripides' claiming him as a disciple is in direct contradiction to <lb/>
            1. 952.</p>
          <p>970. ' Coan, not Chian.' The meaning of this is not clear. It <lb/>
            sounds like a proverb : if so, it must be an old one, which survived <lb/>
            its application. The Chians, until they revolted in 412, were most <lb/>
            devoted to the Athenian cause, in return for which they were <lb/>
            specially mentioned in treaties, public prayers, &amp;c., and, as a <lb/>
            character in the Birds says, tacked on everywhere.' Possibly the <lb/>
            name 4 Chian' came to be considered the equivalent of loyal and <lb/>
            honest friend', and this signification outlived the disloyalty of its <lb/>
            bearers.</p>
          <p>The Coans belonged to the Carian race. A proverb tells us that <lb/>
            ‘ three C's', the Carians, the Cappadocians, and the Cilicians are <lb/>
            ‘thoroughly bad’. Possibly the Coans were the worst-liked Carians, <lb/>
            just as the Chians had been the best-liked Ionians. Some MSS. <lb/>
             <pb n="89"/>
            call Theramenes a Cean, and commentators have supposed that he <lb/>
            really was one ; but if'he had not been an Athenian, Aristophanes <lb/>
            would have taken good care to say so.</p>
          <p>There are many other explanations of this passage ; possibly all <lb/>
            wrong, as mine may be ; certainly none of them more satisfactory.</p>
          <p>992. A quotation from the Myrmidons of Aeschylus.</p>
          <p>1005. The chorus consider Tragedy to have been mere ' prating' <lb/>
            till Aeschylus raised its tone.</p>
          <p>1012. The humour of this lies in its impossibility.</p>
          <p>1017. The shield of Ajax was made seven-ox-hides thick.</p>
          <p>1021. This play, The Seven against Thebes, has survived, as also <lb/>
            the Persae (1. 1026).</p>
          <p>1028. The death of Darius is not reported in our version of the <lb/>
            play, but his ghost appears.</p>
          <p>1032. No genuine writings of Orpheus and Musaeus have <lb/>
            survived, but we still have Hesiod's Works and Days.</p>
          <p>1037. Pantocles, a lyric poet, gained the nick-name Clumsy from <lb/>
            this. He was taking part in a procession, when he remembered <lb/>
            that he had not put the plume on his helmet, and made an attempt <lb/>
            to fix it on from the outside. As it had to be fastened in its place <lb/>
            from the inside, he was not successful.</p>
          <p>1040. Lamachus died in the Sicilian expedition. Before this <lb/>
            Aristopbanes constantly attacked him, owing to his persistent op­ <lb/>
            position to proposals of peace.</p>
          <p>1043. Phaedra was enamoured of her stepson. Sthenoboea <lb/>
            behaved to Bellerophon as the wife of Potiphar did to Joseph. <lb/>
            Euripides wrote two plays about each of them.</p>
          <p>1048. Euripides had two wives, both unfaithful.</p>
          <p>1051.No satisfactory explanation of this incredible statement <lb/>
            can be given.</p>
          <p>1065. A rich Athenian might be called upon to equip a ship for <lb/>
            the navy, if his means were sufficient.</p>
          <p>1068. The fish-market was frequented by the gourmands and <lb/>
            gourmets of Athens.</p>
          <p>1080. In his Auge and his Aeolus, Euripides has dealt with these <lb/>
            things.</p>
          <p>1081. This expression occurs in his Phrixus and his Polyides.</p>
          <p>1096. It was the regular and recognized custom for the Potter­ <lb/>
             <pb n="90"/>
            folk to quicken up the slowest runners in the Torch-race in this <lb/>
            way. The Panathenaea was the greatest of all the festivals of <lb/>
            Athens. Its amusements included games and sports of every <lb/>
            description.</p>
          <p>1114. It is uncertain what book the spectators had. It is impos­ <lb/>
            sible that all, or even most of them, can have possessed a copy of <lb/>
            the play, even if we do not believe that the theatre held 50,000 <lb/>
            persons. Enough MS. copies could not have been made between <lb/>
            the first and the second performances, supposing these words to <lb/>
            have been introduced in the second edition. But some work on <lb/>
            the drama generally may have been lately published and widely <lb/>
            read.</p>
          <p>1124. See note, 1. 758, for the plays referred to : the quotation <lb/>
            which follows is from the second of them. The language is almost <lb/>
            as obscure as Euripides asserts.</p>
          <p>1144. Hermes and other gods had as many attributes and <lb/>
            functions as those assigned to Our Lady.</p>
          <p>1148. Dionysus' unsavoury joke, as Aeschylus considers it, <lb/>
            saves Aristophanes the trouble of finishing what might have been <lb/>
            an unconvincing criticism.</p>
          <p>1159. Instead of asking for a couple of kneading-troughs straight <lb/>
            out, the borrower calls them by two different names, identical in <lb/>
            meaning.</p>
          <p>1163 and 1174. Such tautology, familiar to us from its frequent <lb/>
            occurrence in our Book of Common Prayer, is generally considered <lb/>
            emphatic and not blameworthy.</p>
          <p>1182. This is from the Antigone of Euripides.</p>
          <p>1195. Dionysus pretends to think that Oedipus may have been <lb/>
            one of the six admirals executed after Arginusae, as lucky then as <lb/>
            ever, if Euripides' idea of luck is right.</p>
          <p>1202. It is not easy to see the point of the ‘ tacking on of the oil­ <lb/>
            flask which will fit many of the prologues of Aeschylus and Sopho­ <lb/>
            cles equally well. It is very probably not meant to be a fair, but <lb/>
            only an amusing, attack on Euripides.</p>
          <p>The plays quoted are :</p>
          <p>1206, &amp;c. The Archelaus, the Hypsipyle, the Sthenoboea, the <lb/>
            Phrixus, the Iphigeneia in Tauris, the Meleager, and the Me­ <lb/>
            lanippe.</p><pb n="91"/>
            
          <p>1248. The criticism of the Lyric poetry is directed against the <lb/>
            music rather than the style or language. The same is true of <lb/>
            Aeschylus' criticisms of Euripides' lyrics.</p>
          <p>1264, &amp;c. The plays quoted are the Myrmidons, the Psychagogoe, <lb/>
            the Telephus (or the Iphigeneia), the Hiereiae, and the Agamem­ <lb/>
            non. The refrain, which makes sense in the first passage, becomes <lb/>
            as meaningless as Calverley's Butter and eggs and a pound of <lb/>
            cheese', afterwards.</p>
          <p>1285, &amp;c. The plays quoted here are the Agamemnon, the <lb/>
            Sphinx, the Agamemnon again, an unknown play, and the Thressae. <lb/>
            The meaning and the appropriateness (or the opposite) of the refrain <lb/>
            are absolutely undiscoverable.</p>
          <p>1299. The music of Phrynichus was too tuneful and melodious <lb/>
            to suit the stern style of Aeschylus.</p>
          <p>1302. Meletus, one of the chief accusers of Socrates, wrote <lb/>
            drinking-songs, erotic ballads, and very inferior tragedies.</p>
          <p>1305. An ugly and very unattractive woman with big ill-shaped <lb/>
            feet is heard playing the equivalent of the bones, and now enters.</p>
          <p>1308. The Lesbian courtesans were noted for their unbridled <lb/>
            lasciviousness, as well as for their fascinations.</p>
          <p>1309, &amp;c. The following passage consists of quotations from <lb/>
            Euripides' plays, strung together irrespective of the sense, and sung <lb/>
            to his music, shakes and all. We have one of these shakes on the <lb/>
            impossible sound of a short ‘ i', in the word ' spinning' (repeated <lb/>
            in 1. 1349).</p>
          <p>1322. Euripides has made a false quantity, which I have repre­ <lb/>
            sented by ĕlbōws. Aeschylus refers to this ‘ foot', and pointing to <lb/>
            the muse's ill-shaped ‘ beetle-crusher * implies that they are a good <lb/>
            match.</p>
          <p>1327. Cyrene was a courtesan who outdid all others in the <lb/>
            variety of her lascivious accomplishments.</p>
          <p>1331. The following monody is not by any means an unfair <lb/>
            parody of the style of Euripides. In it a housewife tells how she <lb/>
            had a terrible dream, which came true, about her neighbour <lb/>
            making a raid upon her fowlhouse, and stealing her pet rooster.</p>
          <p>1340. Purification after an ill-omened dream was resorted to, in <lb/>
            the hope that what it foretold might be averted.</p>
          <p>1356. The police (who were archers) are here called in, in heroic <lb/>
             <pb n="92"/>
            language, and Artemis, goddess of the chase, is invoked to help <lb/>
            them, as is Hecate, to whom the night is as clear as the day</p>
          <p>1364. The testing verses by weight is of course meant to be mere <lb/>
            playing to the gallery. Euripides' chance was gone, as Rogers <lb/>
            suggests, as soon as he had relieved tragedy of its weight (see <lb/>
            1. 941).</p>
          <p>1374. Some scrupulous folk omitted the name of any god in their <lb/>
            conversational oaths. Compare the French ‘ sacré’, and our ‘ 0 my’.</p>
          <p>1382. The plays from which the rivals quote are : the Medea, <lb/>
            the Antigone, and the Meleager of Euripides, and the Philoctetes, <lb/>
            the Niobe, and the Glaucus Potnieus of Aeschylus. The line <lb/>
            Dionysus suggests is from the Telefihus.</p>
          <p>1406. There was no doubt some proverb about the weight-lifting <lb/>
            powers of the Egyptians, inferred, as Merry suggests, from their <lb/>
            buildings.</p>
          <p>1413. Commentators are about equally divided as to who is <lb/>
            ‘ clever' and who is ‘ liked'. There is the same uncertainty in <lb/>
            1. 1434.</p>
          <p>1419. The fall of Athens would mean the death of the drama, <lb/>
            which was an essential part of the Greek worship.</p>
          <p>1422. Alcibiades was now living in retirement in Thrace, where <lb/>
            he had an estate. He had been one of the generals appointed to <lb/>
            conduct the Sicilian expedition (415) but was at once recalled, on <lb/>
            a charge of impiety, when he reached Sicily, and as he did not <lb/>
            return, he was exiled. He joined the Spartan side, but was recalled <lb/>
            at the time of the ' Four Hundred' by their opponents, and in 408 <lb/>
            was at the head of the army and navy, and practically dictator. <lb/>
            In 406 the Athenian fleet was defeated at Notium, during his un­ <lb/>
            justifiable absence, and he was deprived of his command, and went <lb/>
            to his estate in voluntary banishment; 1. 1425 Exactly describes <lb/>
            the attitude of Athens towards him. His brilliant genius made him <lb/>
            as dangerous as a foe as he was helpful as a friend, and there was <lb/>
            a very strong feeling in favour of his recall, which no doubt Aristo­ <lb/>
            phanes shared, but preferred to let the audience express their <lb/>
            opinion about it. Euripides is opposed to it; Aeschylus says <lb/>
            ‘ make the best of a bad bargain’.</p>
          <p>1437. Euripides' serious counsel having fallen flat, he offers a <lb/>
            suggestion intended to be ridiculous, out of pique, and acknow­ <lb/>
             <pb n="93"/>
            ledges later (1. 1433) that he is not responsible for it. Cleocritus <lb/>
            was a big clumsy ostrich-like man, and Cinesias a skinny, frail, <lb/>
            dwarf.</p>
          <p>1443. The ridiculous plan having also fallen flat, he gives advice <lb/>
            as ambiguous as the answer of an oracle, which in Greek must have <lb/>
            sounded even less intelligible than in English; so he has to explain <lb/>
            it (1. 1446, &amp;c.).</p>
          <p>1451. The proverbial cleverness of Palamedes made Odysseus so <lb/>
            jealous that he caused his death.</p>
          <p>1459, &amp;c. These lines probably belong to the second edition of <lb/>
            the play, and were substituted for others, as the audience, when <lb/>
            the play was first performed, did not take the bait Aristophanes <lb/>
            offered them, and pronounce definitely upon Alcibiades' recall. <lb/>
            Aeschylus, speaking for him, says that Athens is past praying for, <lb/>
            and that the stage is no longer the place for the expression of <lb/>
            political opinions, at such a crisis: but, when further entreated by <lb/>
            Dionysus to suggest some way out of this hopeless condition, he <lb/>
            falls back upon the well-known advice of Pericles, given at the <lb/>
            beginning of the war, which resembled the modem cry : 'Spend <lb/>
            your last penny on your navy.'</p>
          <p>1466. Dionysus says that it is easy enough to spend your last <lb/>
            penny, but not so easy to see that the navy gets it, when 6,000 <lb/>
            jurors must first be paid.</p>
          <p>1467. Some say this is a quotation from Euripides; others, with <lb/>
            greater probability, that it is from some game played by children.</p>
          <p>1475. In the Aeolus of Euripides this line occurs with 'doers' in <lb/>
            the place of' audience <lb/>
            1482. It is most unlikely that Euripides belonged at any time <lb/>
            to the Socratic circle, but Aristophanes looks upon Socrates as a <lb/>
            teacher of the same new-fangled political and religious opinions as <lb/>
            Euripides.</p>
          <p>1504. A rope is sent, for Cleophon to hang himself: the same, <lb/>
            or other instruments of suicide, to the Board of Finance, appointed <lb/>
            to raise money after the Sicilian expedition. Mynnex and Arche­ <lb/>
            nomus are unknown. Nicomachus is attacked in an oration of <lb/>
            Lysias, for embezzlement of public money.</p>
          <p>1514. Adeimantus, a general who shared command with <lb/>
            Alcibiades in 407, was held reponsible through treachery for the <lb/>
             <pb n="94"/>
            Athenian defeat at Aegospotami in 404, which caused the fall of <lb/>
            Athens. His title ' son of White-Feather' does not, in the original, <lb/>
            imply cowardice.</p>
          <p>1526. These closing hexameters and, according to some commen­ <lb/>
            tators, certain expressions quoted in them, are intended to recall <lb/>
            the style of Aeschylus.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">NOTE ON THE MYSTERIES AND THE CHORUS OF THIS PLAY.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>In the part taken by the Chorus we have an imitation of some <lb/>
            of the ritual, &amp;c., observed in the Eleusinian mysteries, religious <lb/>
            ceremonies of the most venerable nature, dating back far into pre­ <lb/>
            historic times, and derived, some say, from Egypt, the cradle of <lb/>
            sacred mysteries. They were celebrated twice a year, and were <lb/>
            of two degrees of importance, the greater Eleusinia being held at <lb/>
            Athens and Eleusis (10 miles distant), in September, the lesser at <lb/>
            Agrae, in the environs of the city, in March. Professor Tucker <lb/>
            has shown, with almost absolute certainty, that the latter are repre­ <lb/>
            sented in this play.</p>
          <p>The Chorus is composed of those who were initiated at this <lb/>
            Festival, the ceremony including the sacrifice of a pig, ritual <lb/>
            washings, ceremonial purifications, the taking of an oath of secrecy, <lb/>
            and certain services of instruction; it was regarded as introductory <lb/>
            to the higher initiation at the Greater Festival.</p>
          <p>The representation, beginning at line 324, and ending at line <lb/>
            460, opens with a Hymn to Iacchus, 324-52, while the pig is (in <lb/>
            imagination) being sacrificed (1. 338). Then follows an imitation <lb/>
            of the customary warning to the unholy and uninitiated to withdraw, <lb/>
            literary and political offenders being substituted for these trans­ <lb/>
            gressors. Three hymns are then sung, the first (372-81) in <lb/>
            honour of Persephone, the second (384-93) addressed to Demeter, <lb/>
            and the last (398-413) a processional hymn to Iacchus, supposed <lb/>
            to be sung on the way to the shrine of his mother Demeter. <lb/>
            Though lacchus is also called Dionysus, he is not identical with <lb/>
            the Dionysus who is one of the characters in this play, and who <lb/>
            was the son of Semele. The procession halts at an imaginary <lb/>
            bridge, to reproduce the customary topical songs', which dealt <lb/>
             <pb n="95"/>
            with public characters with an unrestrained licence and a freedom <lb/>
            of abuse unfamiliar to us, and probably (as Professor Tucker says <lb/>
            of Greek abuse in general) meaning nothing in particular, but <lb/>
            used in a ‘ Pickwickian sense’. These jokes at the Bridge were <lb/>
            said to have been originally made by some one (Iambe or Baubo), <lb/>
            who when Demeter, heartbroken at the loss of her daughter <lb/>
            Persephone, sat weeping at the bridge over the Cephisus, in Attica, <lb/>
            tried to make her laugh by jokes of this kind. At line 449 the <lb/>
            women who have joined in this pageant pass out of the theatre, and <lb/>
            the men remain to fill the part of the regular chorus in the play.</p>
          <p>These Lesser Mysteries were connected with the annual festival <lb/>
            Anthesteria, held in honour of Dionysus about a month after this <lb/>
            play was brought out. The festival lasted for three days, which <lb/>
            were called ' The Broaching of the Casks ’,‘ The Cups ’, and ' The <lb/>
            Pitchers'. The second day was devoted to drinking, from the <lb/>
            effects of which those who, on the third day, offered pitchers or <lb/>
            pots full of flowers, vegetables, &amp;c., still suffered when they came <lb/>
            to worship (see line 218). It has been conjectured that the second <lb/>
            performance of this play took place at this festival.</p>
