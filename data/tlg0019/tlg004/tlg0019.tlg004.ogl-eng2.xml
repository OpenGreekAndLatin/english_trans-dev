          <p>THE Wasps was exhibited before the Athenian people at the Lenæan <lb/>
            festival, while Ameinias was Archon : in the second year therefore of <lb/>
            the 89th Olympiad (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐν ῃ̂ πθ̕̕' ̕̕̕</foreign>’<foreign xml:lang="grc">Ολυμπιάδί ἔτει</foreign> <hi rend="italic"><foreign xml:lang="grc">β</foreign>'</hi>) : at the commencement <lb/>
            of the year B.C. 422.</p>
          <p>It gained either the first or the second place; but which of the two <lb/>
            we cannot now with certainty determine. The Argument which <lb/>
            supplies our only information on the subject, supplies it in a corrupt and <lb/>
            mutilated paragraph, which may be emended in accordance with either <lb/>
            view. It seems to me, however, that there are very strong grounds for <lb/>
            believing that the highest place was awarded to the Wasps; the second <lb/>
            to the Rehearsal (<foreign xml:lang="grc">Προαγών</foreign>); and the third-about this there is no <lb/>
            doubt-to the Ambassadors (<foreign xml:lang="grc">Πρέϭεβις</foreign>) of Leucon.</p>
          <p>The paragraph in question is found in the following form in both the <lb/>
            great Aristophanic MSS. :—</p><figure type="illustration">
            <graphic url="ENG_BELL_10_fig1.jpg"/></figure>
          <p>And our first business is to detect the genuine original reading which <lb/>
            lies hid beneath the confused and unmeaning jumble of words <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐν τῇ</foreign> <note type="footnote">a <foreign xml:lang="grc">βηι</foreign>. So the Venetian MS. The Ravenna MS. has <foreign xml:lang="grc">βἦν</foreign>. The name of the <lb/>
            archon should be written ’ <foreign xml:lang="grc">Αμεινίου</foreign>. See Mr. Fynes Clinton, Fasti Helleniei, Anno <lb/>
            423. I give no credit to the statement of the Scholiast on Clouds, 31, that the <lb/>
            Amynias satirized in the Clouds and in the Play before us is really Ameinias the <lb/>
            Archon, the name being slightly changed because <foreign xml:lang="grc">κωμῳδεῖντὸν ἄρχοντα ὁ νόμος <lb/>
            ἐκώλυεν</foreign>. </note> <note type="footnote"> A 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="iv"/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">πόλει</foreign> ’<foreign xml:lang="grc">Ολυμπιάδι βηι</foreign>. And knowing, as we do, that the Wasps was <lb/>
            exhibited in the second year of the 89th Olympiad, we can hardly resist <lb/>
            the conclusion that the true reading is <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐν τῇ πθ' Ολυμπιάδι ἔτει</foreign> <hi rend="italic"><foreign xml:lang="grc">β</foreign>'</hi>. <lb/>
            This is Kanngiesser's emendation,b and one more simple and satisfactory <lb/>
            has rarely been made. And it has the additional merit of bringing the <lb/>
            present chronological notice into exact accordance with the form of <lb/>
            similar notices in other Arguments. Thus the chronological notices in <lb/>
            the Arguments of the Agamemnon and the Hippolytus are as <lb/>
            follows :—<lb/>
            <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BELL_10_fig2.jpg"/></figure></p>
          <p>It will be observed that in the latter example the chronological <lb/>
            notice is immediately followed by a statement of the order in which the <lb/>
            three selected competitors were ranged. And such is the ordinary form <lb/>
            of these theatrical Arguments. First comes the chronological notice, <lb/>
            complete in itself. Then follows the List of the Victors, also complete <lb/>
            in itself.</p>
          <p>And this leads us to a second error in the Argument of the Wasps ; <lb/>
            viz. an omission in the List of the Victors. And Paulmier c long ago <lb/>
            suggested that the word <foreign xml:lang="grc">δεύτερος</foreign>, and the name of the second successful <lb/>
            competitor, must have dropped out from between the words <foreign xml:lang="grc">Φιλωνίδης</foreign> <lb/>
            and <foreign xml:lang="grc">Προαγῶνι</foreign>.</p>
          <p>Adopting, at least for the present,d the suggestion of Paulmier, we <lb/>
            shall read the paragraph as follows :—<lb/>
            <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BELL_10_fig3.jpg"/></figure><note type="footnote"> b De scenâ Atticâ, p. 270. So M. Boeckh, Græc. Trag. Princ., p. 36, and <lb/>
              Mr. Fynes Clinton, Fasti Hellenici, Introduction and Anno 422. </note><note type="footnote"> c And so Mr. Fynes Clinton in the Introduction to the Fasti Hellenici. </note><note type="footnote"> d We shall presently see that there is probably a further error in the Argument, <lb/>
              but it does not affect the point now under consideration. </note> <lb/>
               <pb n="v"/>
              in substantial harmony with the usual forme of similar notices in other <lb/>
              Arguments. And, so read, it informs us in ordinary language that the <lb/>
              Wasps carried off the highest prize at the Lenæan festival, B.C. 422.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, in order to obtain a statement that the second <lb/>
            place only was awarded to the Wasps, we must accept Dindorf's <lb/>
            arrangement,f and read the paragraph as follows :— <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BELL_10_fig4.jpg"/></figure><note type="footnote"> <unclear/> To bring the matter more clearly before the reader, I subjoin a list of the <lb/>
              similar notices contained in other theatrical Arguments. </note> <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BELL_10_fig5.jpg"/></figure><note type="footnote"> Hippolytus. This has already been cited in the text. </note><note type="footnote"> ' Dindorf's Aristophanes, ii. 548. On the Proagon of Aristophanes. A similar <lb/>
              suggestion had been already made by Petit. </note></p><pb n="vi"/>
              
          <p>This is an arrangement which, to my mind, carries with it its own <lb/>
            condemnation. For who ever saw a fragment from the List of the <lb/>
            Victors interpolated into the midst of the chronological note ? The <lb/>
            chronological note is uniformly complete in itself, and is succeeded, not <lb/>
            crossed and broken into, by the List of the Victors.</p>
          <p>Again, a writer attempting to fix the exact date of a Play by a reference <lb/>
            to the Olympiad reckoning would in all probability give, not merely <lb/>
            the Olympiad itself, but also the year of the Olympiad; as in the <lb/>
            Arguments of the Agamemnon and Hippolytus, cited above. The only <lb/>
            instance to the contrary is to be found in the Argument of the Medea, <lb/>
            and there the very phraseology (<foreign xml:lang="grc">κατά τὴν</foreign> ’<foreign xml:lang="grc">Ολυμπιάδα</foreign>, not <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐν τῇ</foreign> ’<foreign xml:lang="grc">Ολυμ­ <lb/>
            πιάδι</foreign>) shows that the writer is not seeking to be definite and exact.</p>
          <p>In the present case, therefore, the <foreign xml:lang="grc">βηι</foreign> or <foreign xml:lang="grc">βην</foreign> of the MSS. is rightly <lb/>
            placed for signifying, and is required to signify, the year of the Olympiad <lb/>
            in which the Play was exhibited : it is wrongly placed for signifying the <lb/>
            prize awarded to the Play.</p>
          <p>Such are the grounds on which it seems to me most probable that, <lb/>
            at the Lenæan festival when Ameinias was Archon, the highest prize <lb/>
            of all g was awarded to the Wasps of Aristophanes.</p>
          <p>A further question however remains, viz. to whom was that prize <lb/>
            awarded ? or in other words, in whose name was the Chorus obtained, <lb/>
            and the Play exhibited ? Did Aristophanes bring it out in his own <lb/>
            name, or did he, as the Argument in its present condition alleges, bring <lb/>
            it out in the name of Philonides ?</p>
          <p>Now we know that, at this theatrical contest, one place (either the <lb/>
            first or the second) was awarded to a Comedy called the Rehearsal, <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">Προαγών</foreign>. And as the ancient grammarians, whilst frequently referring <note type="footnote"> If The Peace, which was exhibited the year after the Wasps, bears evident <lb/>
            traces of having been hastily put together to meet a particular emergency: <lb/>
            but Aristophanes would hardly have repeated in it an important part of the <lb/>
            Parabasis of the Wasps, had not the Wasps itself been received with the highest <lb/>
            favour by the Athenian people. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="vii"/>
            to a " Rehearsal" of Aristophanes, recognize no other Comedy bearing <lb/>
            that name, it was long ago suggested by Jungermann,h and the <lb/>
            suggestion has met with universal acceptance, that the Rehearsal which <lb/>
            competed with the Wasps was itself the work of the author of the <lb/>
            Wasps. It appears therefore that, at this one festival, Aristophanes <lb/>
            produced two separate Comedies, the Wasps and the Rehearsal, and <lb/>
            was successful with each.</p>
          <p>According to the MS. statement, highly improbable in itself, but in <lb/>
            this respect followed by Dindorf, both these Comedies were exhibited <lb/>
            in the name of Philonides: whilst according to Paulmier's correction, <lb/>
            it was the Wasps only, and not the Rehearsal, which was so exhibited. <lb/>
            But there are, I think, strong indications to show that Paulmier's <lb/>
            correction, though right in assuming that only one Comedy would have <lb/>
            been exhibited in the name of Philonides, yet does not itself go to the <lb/>
            root of the matter; that in truth Aristophanes brought out the Wasps <lb/>
            in his own name , and that it was the Rehearsal, and not the Wasps, <lb/>
            which he handed over to Philonides.</p>
          <p>In the Parabasis Proper of the Wasps, Aristophanes gives us a sketch <lb/>
            of his own dramatic career. At first, he says, he used to father his <lb/>
            productions on his friends: like some familiar spirit, he loved to dive <lb/>
            into the breasts, and pour his witticisms through the lips of others. <lb/>
            After a while, he threw off his disguise, and came forward openly, in <lb/>
            his own name, to obtain a Chorus for himself, <foreign xml:lang="grc">χορὸν αἰτεῖν καθ</foreign>’ <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἑαυτόν</foreign>.i <lb/>
            So, for the first time, he descended into the arena as an avowed and <lb/>
            recognized Teacher of Comedy, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὁ τοῦ χοροῦ διδάϭκαλος, χοροδιδάϭκαλρς, <lb/>
            κωμῳδοδιδάϭκαλος</foreign>, or as he expresses it in the Wasps, <foreign xml:lang="grc">πρῶτον ῆρξε διδάϭ­ <lb/>
            κειν</foreign>. Thenceforward he set himself in earnest to the task of ridding <lb/>
            the State of its plagues and its nuisances. He became an <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀλεξίκακος</foreign>, <lb/>
            a <foreign xml:lang="grc">τῆς χώρας καθαρτὴς</foreign>, a Heracles the Destroyer of Monsters. Two <lb/>
            Plays had already been so produced : two Labours of Heracles had <lb/>
            already been undertaken. In the KNIGHTS he had grappled with <note type="footnote"> h At Pollux, x. segm. 44. </note><note type="footnote"><unclear/> Parabasis of the Knights. See also the Parabasis of the Clouds. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="viii"/>
            the savage Demagogue, loud of tongue and terrible of form: a <lb/>
            monstrous apparition, formidable for his own strength and ferocity, and <lb/>
            still more so by reason of the cloud of satellites who fluttered about his <lb/>
            person, and bristled up the moment he was attacked. This warfare <lb/>
            he is still waging in the Wasps, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἔτι καὶ νυνὶ πολεμεῖ</foreign>. In the CLOUDS he <lb/>
            had assailed the Spectral Shapes, the Fevers and Agues of the Sophistical <lb/>
            School. This second attempt had proved abortive; although the <lb/>
            Comedy with which it was made was (he contends) the best and <lb/>
            cleverest Comedy that had ever been put upon the stage. It is in <lb/>
            respect of this failure that the Poet in the Parabasis of the Wasps is <lb/>
            personally expostulating with the Athenian people. And I do not <lb/>
            think that any one can thoroughly enter into the spirit of that expos­ <lb/>
            tulation, without feeling that the Play which contains it must of <lb/>
            necessity have been exhibited by the poet himself, as his own work, in. <lb/>
            his own name: that he could not, in this Play, have been acting the <lb/>
            Familiar Spirit, and pouring his expostulation through alien lips, <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπικουρῶν ἑτέροιϭι ποιηταῖς</foreign>. The whole tenor of the expostulation, the <lb/>
            attitude which the Poet assumes towards his own previous Comedies, <lb/>
            both those which had been fathered on Philonides and Callistratus, and <lb/>
            those which he had produced in his own name, seems to me of necessity <lb/>
            to imply that the Wasps, like the Knights and the Clouds, with which <lb/>
            its Parabasis so closely links it, was exhibited on the Athenian stage <lb/>
            as the avowed and recognized production of Aristophanes.</p>
          <p>Moreover, we are told by the author of the third section in the <lb/>
            compilation <foreign xml:lang="grc">περὶ κωμῳδίας καὶ 'Αριϭτο</foreign><hi rend="italic"><foreign xml:lang="grc">Φάνους</foreign></hi> that the Plays brought <lb/>
            out in the name of Philonides j were those in which Euripides and <lb/>
            Socrates were attacked, whilst the Plays in which the Poet treated of <lb/>
            politics and public affairs were handed over to Callistratus. It is true <lb/>
            that the author of the eleventh section in the same compilation k tells <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BELL_10_fig6.jpg"/></figure> <lb/>
               <pb n="ix"/>
              a very different story. But it is generally agreed, and all that is known <lb/>
              on the subject tends to prove, that the former statement is correct. <lb/>
              The Comedies of Aristophanes 1 range themselves under two heads, viz. <lb/>
              (1) criticisms on the Demagogues and public affairs; and these, when <lb/>
              he did not bring them out in his own name, he seems to have handed <lb/>
              over to Callistratus, and (2) criticisms the Sophists and the sophis­ <lb/>
              tical poetry of Euripides; and these were the Comedies which fell to <lb/>
              the lot of Philonides. We have thus another ground for believing that <lb/>
              the Wasps could not have been exhibited in the name of Philonides.m</p>
          <p>But was the Rehearsal a Comedy which the Poet would have been <lb/>
            likely to entrust to Philonides ? We have every reason to believe that <lb/>
            it was. For the Scholiast on the Wasps n expressly informs us that in <lb/>
            this Play Euripides was introduced on the stage as the object of the <lb/>
            Poet's satire, and Englishmen, at all events, can have no difficulty in <lb/>
            imagining how a Comedy on such a subject may have been made sub­ <lb/>
            servient to such a purpose.</p>
          <p>And on the whole, therefore, I am strongly inclined to believe that <lb/>
            Aristophanes, brought out the Comedy of the Wasps in his own name : <lb/>
            and (possibly because no one competitor was at that timo allowed to <note type="footnote"> I No doubt the line of demarcation is not always very clearly defined. Of course <lb/>
            political satire is not wholly excluded from the Comedies which deal mainly with <lb/>
            Euripides and the Sophists: nor, on the other hand, does Aristophanes refrain from <lb/>
            incidentally assailing these last-mentioned objects of his ridicule even in his most <lb/>
            thorough-going political dramas. But I do not understand how certain recent <lb/>
            critics (Ranke, Vita Aristophanis, ed. Meineke, I. xxxix, following Roetseher, <lb/>
            Aristoph. p. 70, and Bernhardy, Griech. Lit. ii. 2. 551) can deny, what seems to me <lb/>
            a self-evident fact, that of the Aristophanic comedies some are specially designed <lb/>
            and constructed for the one purpose, and some for the other. The Clouds, the <lb/>
            Thesmophoriazusæ, and the Frogs naturally fall into one class: the Acharnians, <lb/>
            the Knights, the Wasps, the Peace, the Birds, and the Lysistrata as clearly belong <lb/>
            to the other. </note><note type="footnote"> m Meineke therefore (Quæst. Seen. ii. p. 30) proposes to change the <foreign xml:lang="grc">διὰ φιλωνίδου</foreign> <lb/>

            of the Rehearsal to be exhibited in the name of Philonides. And the <lb/>
            List of Victors should, I think, stand as follows :— <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BELL_10_fig7.jpg"/></figure> <lb/>
              a reading which differs from that of the MSS. merely by the <lb/>
              insertion of a single letter, <foreign xml:lang="grc">β´</foreign> (<foreign xml:lang="grc">δεύτερος</foreign>), and does not require (as <lb/>
              Paulmier’s correction requires) the insertion of the name of another <lb/>
              competitor.</p>
          <p>And in support of this reading I would add two other observations, <lb/>
            which, however trivial they may appear in themselves, are perhaps not <lb/>
            absolutely unimportant in considering what is the most probable emen­ <lb/>
            dation of an admittedly corrupt text. (1) In every Argument which <lb/>
            tells us that the Comedy to which it is prefixed obtained the highest <lb/>
            place, the words are simply <foreign xml:lang="grc">πρῶτος ἦν</foreign>,° or <foreign xml:lang="grc">πρῶτος ἐνίκα</foreign>, without repenting <lb/>
            the victor’s, name. It would therefore be a departure from the ordinary <lb/>
            style of these Arguments to read (as Paulmier reads) <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐδιδάχθη διὰ <lb/>
            φιλωνίδου. καὶ ἐνίκα πρῶτος Φιλωνίδης</foreign>. (2) In the List of Victors, as <lb/>
            a general rule, the ordinals, <foreign xml:lang="grc">πρῶτος, δεύτερος, τρίτος</foreign>, maintain the same <lb/>
            relative position throughout. It is either <foreign xml:lang="grc">πρῶτος</foreign> A, <foreign xml:lang="grc">δεύτερος</foreign> B, <foreign xml:lang="grc">τρίτος</foreign> <lb/>
            C, or A <foreign xml:lang="grc">πρῶτος</foreign>, B <foreign xml:lang="grc">δεύτερος</foreign>, C <foreign xml:lang="grc">τρίτος</foreign>, not <foreign xml:lang="grc">πρῶτος</foreign> A, ... C <foreign xml:lang="grc">τρίτος</foreign>. It <lb/>
            would therefore be a departure from the ordinary style to read (as <lb/>
            Dindorf reads) <foreign xml:lang="grc">πρῶτος Φιλωνίδης Προαγῶνι, Λεύκων Πρέσβεσι τρίτος</foreign>. <lb/>
            On the other hand the reading which I propose is in every point in <lb/>
            minute conformity with the ordinary style of these theatrical Arguments.</p>
          <p>The only difficulty arises from the circumstance that the words <foreign xml:lang="grc">διὰ <lb/>
            Φιλωνίδον</foreign> are found in the preceding chronological note. But inas­ <lb/>
            much as the MS. reading of the List of the Victors, <foreign xml:lang="grc">καὶ ἐνίκα πρῶτος <lb/>
            Φιλωνίδης Προαγῶνι Λεύκων Πρέσβεσι τρίτος</foreign>, can be brought into the <lb/>
            ordinary form in no other way than by inserting <foreign xml:lang="grc">δεύτερος</foreign>, after <foreign xml:lang="grc">Προαγῶνι</foreign>, <lb/>
            so as to make Philonides take the second place with the Rehearsal: <note type="footnote"> ° See the Arguments, cited above, of the Acharnians, the Knights, and the <unclear/> <lb/>

            inasmuch as it is extremely improbable, if not impossible, that both <lb/>
            Plays should have been brought out in his one name: and inasmuch as <lb/>
            the Parabasis of the Wasps assumes throughout that this Play was <lb/>
            exhibited in the name of Aristophanes himself, and indeed the Wasps <lb/>
            did not, as the Rehearsal did, belong to the class of Comedies usually <lb/>
            assigned to Philonides, we may, I think, safely conclude that the words <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">διὰ Φιλωνίδου</foreign> crept into the text after, and as a natural consequence of, <lb/>
            the corruption of the List of the Victors.</p>
          <p>In my opinion therefore Aristophanes gained the first place with the <lb/>
            Wasps: and Philonides (his nominee) the second with the Rehearsal: <lb/>
            and the whole passage should be read as follows :—</p><figure type="illustration">
            <graphic url="ENG_BELL_10_fig8.jpg"/></figure>
          <p>Of the Rehearsal of Aristophanes only ten insignificant fragments <lb/>
            are known to exist: and they afford us no clue to the character or <lb/>
            construction of the plot. Of Leucon's Ambassadors no remains have <lb/>
            been discovered.</p>
          <p>The Wasps was exhibited only ten months later than the Clouds. <lb/>
            And when we consider the long preparations which must inevitably <lb/>
            have been required before a Comedy could be put upon the stage, the <lb/>
            time consumed first in obtaining and then in educating the Chorus, the <lb/>
            numerous rehearsals, and all the various preliminaries essential to the <lb/>
            success of the undertaking, we cannot doubt that the Wasps was not <lb/>
            merely on the stocks, but far advanced'towards completion, before the <lb/>
            defeat of the Clouds occurred. And I think that we trace the effects <lb/>
            of that defeat, not only in the indignant expostulations which the Poet <lb/>
            addresses to his audience, but also in the singular and striking in­ <lb/>
            equality which we find between different portions of this one Comedy <lb/>
            of the Wasps. The victory of the Wine-flagon over the Clouds was <lb/>
            something more than the victory of Cratinus over Aristophanes : it <lb/>
            was the victory of the coarse buffoonery, the <foreign xml:lang="grc">φόρτος</foreign>, of the older <note type="footnote"> <unclear>H</unclear> 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="xii"/>
            drama over the higher, purer, and more intellectual humour with <lb/>
            which the younger Poet was endeavouring to supplant it. The grand <lb/>
            earlier scenes of the Wasps which follow the entrance of the Chorus- <lb/>
            scenes, shown by the great prodigality of metres, and still more clearly <lb/>
            and unmistakeably by the prevalence of the long Aristophanic verses, <lb/>
            to have been especial favourites of their author ;—the noble Poetry of <lb/>
            the Strophe and Antistrophe, of the Epirrhema and Antepirrhema; and <lb/>
            the orchestral contest with which the Play concludes, were written (is <lb/>
            it fanciful to believe ?) when Aristophanes was still in the full tide of <lb/>
            unbroken success, buoyed up by the glory of his past career, sanguine <lb/>
            of a still more splendid triumph with the Clouds, and believing himself <lb/>
            to be the destined regenerator of the Athenian stage. The servile <lb/>
            jokes, the jests cut upon the audience at the commencement of the <lb/>
            Play, the tipsy pugnacity of Philocleon, were added when Aristophanes <lb/>
            had been taught that if he would retain his position as the successful <lb/>
            and popular poet of the day, he must not altogether discard the broad <lb/>
            farce, the laughable personalities, the vulgar scurrility of his immediate <lb/>
            predecessors. Nor is this mere conjecture. The tipsy scenes we can <lb/>
            with something like certainty pronounce to be an extraneous element, <lb/>
            foreign to the original scheme of the Play. It is impossible p that <lb/>
            either the little choral ode (1450—1473) felicitating Bdelycleon on the <lb/>
            probable success of his experiment, or the subsequent harangue of <lb/>
            Xanthias describing the effect of the long untasted wine upon -his old <lb/>
            master, should in their original conception have-been preceded by a <lb/>
            series of farcical scenes, showing that the experiment had already been <lb/>
            tried and had already failed, and that the wine had already been tasted <lb/>
            with the result to be expected rather than desired. Nor again is it <lb/>
            easier to reconcile the introductory dialogue of the slaves with the <lb/>
            behaviour and the statements of the Chorus when they first appear <lb/>
            upon the stage. According to the narrative of Xanthias, the attempts <lb/>

            considerable period of time, and been attended with incidents which <lb/>
            must have become notorious to his fellow-dicasts. On one occasion he <lb/>
            is confined for the night in Ægina, and crosses the straits in early morn <lb/>
            to be present at the opening of the Courts; on another, he actually <lb/>
            enters the Court in the guise and with the timbrel of a Corybant.q But <lb/>
            when the Chorus appear, they speak of a very different state of things. <lb/>
            According to their statements, they call every morning to summon forth <lb/>
            their friend, and he is invariably ready to accompany them to the Court. <lb/>
            Nothing whatever has happened to interrupt the regularity of his <lb/>
            attendance; he had come yesterday ;r they cannot imagine why he does <lb/>
            not come to-day. When they find him detained a prisoner in his own <lb/>
            house, they are in absolute ignorance of the name and motives of his <lb/>
            detainer, and it is with the utmost surprise, not unmingled at first with <lb/>
            incredulity,s that they hear of Bdelycleon's designs. In each case there­ <lb/>
            fore we have solid grounds for believing that the scenes which appeal <lb/>
            to the lower tastes of the audience were added by an after-thought, and <lb/>
            formed no part of the original scheme of the Play.</p>
          <p>Yet notwithstanding the introduction of much that might better <lb/>
            have been omitted, the Wasps is in my judgment inferior' to few of <lb/>
            the Aristophanic comedies in elaboration and artistic excellence : and <lb/>
            had its subject been as generally interesting as those of the Clouds, <lb/>
            the Frogs, and the Thesmophoriazusæ, it would probably have been <lb/>
            reckoned amongst the poet's most successful performances. It abounds <note type="footnote"> q Indeed, even before the persecution commenced he had not, according to <lb/>

W. von Schlegel, as is well known, pronounced the Wasps to be the feeblest <lb/>

            declares it to be the most dexterous of all the Aristophanic comedies; and K. 0. <lb/>
            Müller, in his History of Greek Literature, endorses Air. Mitchell's view, and affirms <lb/>
            the Wasps to be undoubtedly one of the most perfect of the plays of Aristophanes. </note> <lb/>

            with genuine hearty wit and graphic vigorous strokes of satire;u but the <lb/>
            subject with which it deals evokes no wide-spread sympathy in the <lb/>
            modern world, and the Play can therefore find no interest save such as <lb/>
            itself creates. Socrates, Æschylus, Euripides,—these are names which <lb/>
            stir the mind of a modern reader as they stirred the mind of an ancient <lb/>
            spectator : but who cares to hear of dicasts and dicasteries ? Law and <lb/>
            Law-courts, no very fascinating subject even to a professional lawyer, <lb/>
            are something more than dry and uninviting, they are positively <lb/>
            repulsive, to the world at large.</p>
          <p>And it is, no doubt, the universal opinion that the Wasps is a <lb/>
            criticism on the Athenian dicasteries; an exposure of the unrighteous­ <lb/>
            ness of their proceedings; a bitter satire on the dicasts themselves. <lb/>
            Mr. Grote is merely stating the popular view as well as his own, when <lb/>
            he saysv that “the poet's purpose was to make the dicasts appear <lb/>
            monsters of caprice and injustice.”</p>
          <p>Now I venture to think that this is an entire and absolute mis­ <lb/>
            apprehension of the intent and purpose of the Wasps. I do not believe <lb/>
            that the Play was in any sense aimed at, or that the mind of Aris­ <lb/>
            tophanes was in any measure alive to, the manifold defects of the dicastic <lb/>
            system. And as to the old dicasts themselves, they are nothing more <lb/>
            or less than the representatives of his own favourite <foreign xml:lang="grc">Μαραθωνομάχαι</foreign>, <lb/>
            the relics of that heroic Past, which Aristophanes was never weary <lb/>
            of contrasting with the degenerate Present. In the Epirrhema he <lb/>
            describes, in the noblest and most glowing eulogy that ever flowed <lb/>
            from the lips of a Comedian, who and what the dicasts were. I will <lb/>
            not cite the passage here. I refer the reader to the original. Let him <lb/>
            carefully peruse the Strophe, the Epirrhema, and the Antistrophe, and <note type="footnote"> u They find no echo in Les Plaideurs, the feeble and insipid play which <lb/>
            Racine intended as an imitation of the Wasps. There is considerable Aristophanic <lb/>

            on the Wasps), contained in " The Ladies in Parliament, and other Pieces, by G. <lb/>
            0. Trevelyan. Cambridge : Deighton, Bell, and Co., 1867." </note><note type="footnote"> v History of Greece, Part ii. chap. vi. note. </note> <lb/>

            say if the men whose deeds and characters are there depicted are men <lb/>
            whom (to use Mr. Grote's expression) the poet is intending to hold up <lb/>
            to reprobation as " monsters of caprice and injustice !”</p>
          <p>Doubtless he does not exempt them from his strokes of wit and satire; <lb/>
            for, once thoroughly in his comic vein, Aristophanes spares neither <lb/>
            friend nor foe: not even Æschylus in the Frogs; not even Nicias and <lb/>
            Demosthenes in the Knights.</p>
          <p>In truth the young Poet, when he wrote the Wasps, was thinking of <lb/>
            something altogether different from an attack upon dicasts and dicas­ <lb/>
            teries. He was regarding the dicasts, not as a legaL tribunal to -be, <lb/>
            criticized, but as a political power tobe conciliated. From the very <lb/>
            commencement of his career he had believed, and proclaimed, himself to <lb/>
            be the champion of Truth and Justice, going forth in their strength w <lb/>
            to smite and overthrow the Twin Powers of evil which were, in his <lb/>
            judgment, undermining the foundations of the greatness and glory of <lb/>
            Athens. On the one hand he attacks the Sophistical School, as <lb/>
            corrupting by its sceptical philosophy the very well-springs of the <lb/>
            simple piety, the unreasoning instinctive virtue in which the Men of <lb/>
            Marathon had been formed and nurtured ;x on the other, he attacks the <lb/>
            Demagogues, as maintaining their lofty position, not for the purposes <lb/>
            of Panhellenic patriotism, nor yet by force of superior wisdom or <lb/>
            integrity ; but for their own selfish ends, and by flattering the vanity, <lb/>
            consulting the tastes, and pandering to the prejudices of the Athenian <lb/>
            populace.</p>
          <p>And the Wasps is merely one phase y in the combat which the Poet <figure type="illustration">

              Philocleon is the Demus of the Knights in another dress. The observation is a just <lb/>

              andthe, dicasts, who constituted their main support and stay in the <lb/>
              popular assemblies, on the other. And this object Aristophanes <lb/>
              endeavours to compass, by showing that while the Demagogues affected <lb/>
              to flatter and patronize the dicastic system, they in reality reserved to <lb/>
              themselves all the substantial benefits and fruits of the alliance, and left <lb/>
              the dicasts to pine and starve in a state of abject and degraded poverty.</p>

            of the Comedy, the contrast between the public pretensions and the <lb/>
            domestic poverty, the res angusta domi, of the Athenian dicasts is every­ <lb/>
            where painted in the most glaring colours. They are brought on the <lb/>
            stage as feeble old men, groping their way through the mud in the dark <lb/>
            with the aid of a common lanthorn, and ill able to afford the oil required <lb/>
            even for that scanty illumination. Their talk is of pot-herbs: their <lb/>
            reminiscences are of the humblest amusements of camp life : and they <lb/>
            are struck with astonishment and consternation at the inconsiderate <lb/>
            audacity of a child who dares to ask for anything so far beyond the <lb/>
            means of a dicast as a homely treat of common figs.</p>

          <p>Passing over the animated skirmishes which are merely preliminary <lb/>

            really lords of all, or are they in reality mere tools and slaves of the <lb/>
            Demagogues themselves ? The whole of Philocleon's harangue is an <lb/>
            elaborate argument in support of the proposition that the dicastic office <lb/>
            is an <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀρχὴ μεγάλη</foreign> :a whilst Bdelycleon, on the contrary, exerts himself <lb/>
            to prove that it is nothing more or less than a <foreign xml:lang="grc">μεγάλη δουλεία</foreign>.b The very <lb/>
            names of the debaters disclose the true object of the debate : the one <lb/>
            is the admirer, the other the opponent, of the ruling demagogue of the <lb/>
            hour.</p>
          <p>I need not pursue the matter further: some additional observations <lb/>
            upon it will be found amongst the notes : but the Play itself is before <lb/>
            the reader, and he can form his own opinion upon the accuracy or <lb/>
            inaccuracy of the theory here propounded.</p>
          <p>It is therefore merely incidentally, and not for its own sake, that the <lb/>
            Poet deals with the dicastic system ; and an intimate knowledge of its <lb/>
            details is in no way essential to a right understanding of the Play. <lb/>
            However, the reader should of course be acquainted with the general <lb/>
            features and outline of the system, with the general character of the <lb/>

              tion : and it was no doubt originally employed as an appellation of the <lb/>
              general assembly of the People, by or before d which, in the early heroic <lb/>
              ages of Hellas, all matters of importance affecting the community were <lb/>
              publicly discussed and decided. In divers of the Hellenic communities e <lb/>
              the name still lingered on, even in historic times, as descriptive of <lb/>
              the People assembled for their ordinary political purposes. But at <lb/>
              Athens,-at what precise period, and through what precise stages we <lb/>
              cannot tell,-the name acquired a more restricted signification : and we <lb/>
              there find it exclusively applied to the People assembled in their judicial <lb/>
              capacity.</p>
          <p>And of course the judicial affairs of an Imperial city, a great and <lb/>
            enterprising mercantile community, could not long be transacted by a <lb/>
            tribunal so absolutely indefinite and fluctuating as a general assembly of <lb/>
            the People, or indeed by any single tribunal whatever. And accordingly <lb/>
            the right of attending the Heliæa was no longer granted to every <lb/>
            Athenian citizen: whilst on the other hand the Heliæa itself was for <lb/>
            ordinary practical purposes divided into various committees or sections, <lb/>
            each sitting as a separate assembly, but each retaining the name and <lb/>
            wielding the authority of the entire Heliæa. Every registered citizen <lb/>
            might still attend, and vote in, the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐκκληϭία</foreign> or political assembly : but <lb/>

              any one would be elected a member of the Heliastic body without his own consent. <lb/>

              that the Athenians to whom it is addressed are for the time assembled.</p>
          <p>In a similar spirit Xenophon j (assuming him to have been the author <lb/>
            of the treatise de Republicâ Atheniensium) observes that if the Allies <lb/>
            had not been compelled to transact their law-suits at Athens, they would <lb/>
            have paid their court to those only of the Athenians who happened,-in <lb/>
            the character of generals, trierarchs, or ambassadors,-to visit the <lb/>
            provincial cities: whereas now, he says, being under the necessity of <lb/>
            submitting their litigation to a tribunal which is none other than the <lb/>
            Athenian Demus itself (<foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐκ ἐν ἄλλοις τιϭὶν ἀλλ</foreign>’ <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐν τω̜̑ δήμω̜</foreign>), they find it <lb/>
            their interest to flatter and make much of the entire Athenian People.</p>
          <p>To an Aristophanic commentator, however, it is possibly a matter of <lb/>
            greater importance to ascertain in what aspect the question presented <lb/>
            itself to the individual mind of Aristophanes. And this may, I think, <lb/>
            be sufficiently gathered from the functions ascribed by the Poet to the <lb/>
            Demus in his carefully elaborated Comedy of the Knights. The Demus <lb/>
            of the Knights is emphatically the Athenian People in their full political <lb/>
            character: the people who fought at Salamis, who assemble in the <lb/>
            Pnyx, who decide on all questions of Peace and of War. And yet it is <lb/>
            He who sits in the dicasteries and receives his three obols a day. The <lb/>
            surest road to his affections is to lighten his dicastic duties, to allow <lb/>
            him to rise for the day when he has got through, and given his decision <lb/>
            on, a single cause. <foreign xml:lang="grc">Ὠ Δη̑με</foreign>, cries Cleon, <figure type="illustration">

          <p>We may see from these facts how it was that, of all persons <lb/>
            discharging public duties in Athens, the dicasts alone were <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀνυπεύθυνοι</foreign>, <lb/>

            Comic Poets (and which has already been more than once mentioned in <lb/>
            the preceding pages), was the pay which each member of the Heliastic <lb/>
            assembly received for each day of attendance on his dicastic duties. <lb/>
            The system of paying the dicasts was introduced by Pericles :n and <lb/>
            doubtless from its very commencement o the payment for a day's work <lb/>
            had been fixed at the sum of three obols. The payment had naturally <lb/>
            a special attraction for the poorer classes, and it ultimately came to be <lb/>

              And as the Heliastic oath was repeated every year, it is inferred that <lb/>
              the Heliastic office lasted for one year only,t and that at the end of the <lb/>
              year a new general election took place.u</p>
          <p>No doubt this seems hardly consistent with the working of the system <note type="footnote"> <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀκροάσασθαι</foreign>.—De Coronâ ad init. The oration of Demosthenes contra Timocr. 746, <lb/>

              <graphic url="ENG_BELL_10_fig19.jpg"/></figure><note type="footnote"> But we cannot safely assume that this is really the genuine oath : it occurs in a <lb/>
              part of the speech which is on other grounds suspected to be spurious: it contains <lb/>
              some very unlikely provisions : and it actually omits that one special clause so <lb/>
              often mentioned (Demosthenes contra Lept. 492; contra Aristocr. 652 ; contra <lb/>
              Bœotum de nomine, 1006 ; Æsch. in Ctes. cap. 3; Pollux, viii. segm 122), that in all <lb/>
              cases to which the law extended the Heliast would decide according to law : and <lb/>
              that where the law was silent he would decide the right according to the best of <lb/>
              his judgment. To account for this, Wolfe (at Demosth. contra Lept. ubi supra) <lb/>
              and Fritzsche (p. 7) suppose two oaths, one to be taken yearly and one daily; <lb/>
              contrary to all probability. </note><note type="footnote"> ' See Wasps, 400, and the note there. “In eo," says Schömann, p. 201, " plerique <lb/>

              Schömann, p. 201. And the argument is accepted and repeated by Fritzsche (p. 5), <lb/>
              who is not usually over ready to adopt the reasonings of Schömann. “ Nam, ut <lb/>
              recte Schoemannus," he says, "jusjurandum annuum sine annuâ sortitione ne <lb/>

              the annual repetition of the Heliastic oath (which is established by the passage <lb/>

              as pourtrayed in the Wasps. The old dicast fears that the Court may <lb/>
              be closed for the day; but he nowhere apprehends that next year he <lb/>
              may not be a dicast at all: he evidently considers (and the whole tone <lb/>
              of the Play would lead us to suppose) that he can continue to hold the <lb/>
              dicastic office, and draw his dicastic pay, as long as he may think <lb/>
              proper. However, if the purpose of the Poet were what I believe, and <lb/>
              have attempted to prove, it to have been, he may not have held himself <lb/>
              bound to strict technical accuracy of detail. And, besides, the many <lb/>
              exceptional circumstances in operation during the Peloponnesian War— <lb/>
              on the one hand the presence in the city of a vast needy population <lb/>
              herding in from the country round, and dependent in many cases on the <lb/>
              dicastic pay for their daily subsistence: on the other, the call for all <lb/>
              able-bodied men to serve in the fleets and armies of Athens-would <lb/>
              necessarily produce great changes and irregularities in the ordinary <lb/>
              working of all the machinery of the state. And it may well have been <lb/>
              that during the stress of the war a man, once a dicast, might (if so <lb/>
              minded) be always a dicast. At any rate there are many other allusions <lb/>
              in the Wasps which, if they are to be taken as strictly and literally <lb/>
              correct, show that the system at work during the Peloponnesian War <lb/>

              so received a payment to which they were not entitled. Chremylus <lb/>

              practice for a dicast to get his name entered as a member of several of <lb/>
              the sectional assemblies, so that if one did not sit, he might still find a <lb/>

            occupied with an attempt to make out, contrary to all authority and <lb/>
            probability, that there were two series of denoting letters (A to K) <lb/>
            employed in these arrangements ; one for the ten sectional assemblies, <lb/>
            and one for the ten Court-houses or Halls; and that every morning <lb/>
            a ballot was taken for the purpose of determining in which Court-house <lb/>
            each section should meet for the day: so that Section A might have to <note type="footnote"> g Plutus, 970-3. <foreign xml:lang="grc">εἰδέ τις δικαστὴς εἰσῄει μὴ κληρωθεὶς εἰς</foreign> TO <foreign xml:lang="grc">δικαστήριον, κατηγο­ <lb/>

            assemble in Hall B one day, in Hall K the next, and so on. It is difficult <lb/>
            to see what object would be attained by such a proceeding as this : <lb/>
            whilst the time and labour required for notifying the result of this <lb/>
            matutinal ballot to the six thousand members of the Heliastic assembly <lb/>
            would have been simply enormous: and the inconvenience in the case <lb/>
            of an adjourned trial would have formed an insuperable objection. The <lb/>
            plan would have been absolutely unworkable. But this theory, as I <lb/>
            have already observed, is as devoid of authority as it is of probability. <lb/>
            It seems to me clear that the division of the Heliastic assembly into <lb/>
            sections was itself nothing more or less than their allotment to the <lb/>
            several Court-houses. It was the allotment to the Court-house which <lb/>
            created the section ; and the term <foreign xml:lang="grc">δικαστήριονι</foreign> was applied indifferently <lb/>
            to the Court-house and the section. The letter on the dicastic badge, <lb/>
            the sectional letter, was employed for the single purpose of denoting <lb/>
            the Court-house to which the dicast belonged. Each Heliast on his <lb/>
            first election was assigned to some particular Court-house, and such <lb/>
            assignment held good during his term of office.</p>
          <p>It would appear too that it was immediately after his assignment to <lb/>
            the Court-house that he was presented with a staff of office, coloured <lb/>
            with the colouring of that particular Court-house,j and having the <note type="footnote"> i Like our word " Court," it signified as well the Judges as the Building in which <lb/>

              no vestige of any dicastic staff in the tombs wherein the dicastic badges <lb/>
              were found : a circumstance which Mr. Dodwell attributes to the more <lb/>
              perishable material of which the staff was made : but it may be observed <lb/>
              that there was nothing to identify or connect the staff with its owner <lb/>
              for the time being : and therefore even if it were not on his death (as is <lb/>
              most probable) returnable to the public treasury, it would hardly have <lb/>
              been interred with him.</p>
          <p>It seems tolerably certain that an ordinary sectional assembly <lb/>
            consisted of 500 members :k and therefore if all the ten sections were <lb/>
            numerically equal, they would absorb only 5000 men; and there would <lb/>
            still be a thousand Heliasts for whom no occupation has been provided. <lb/>
            And Matthiæ1 supposed that these were reserved as supernumeraries, <lb/>
            to fill up any vacancies that might occur during the year: a suggestion <lb/>
            which rests on no authority; does not commend itself by any intrinsic <lb/>
            probability of its own; and is strikingly at variance with Bdelycleon's <lb/>
            calculation in Wasps, 661-3 ;m for that calculation assumes it to be at <lb/>
            least possible that all the six thousand Heliasts should be engaged in <lb/>
            their dicastic duties, and drawing their dicastic pay, at one and the same <lb/>
            time. If therefore there were, in truth, a thousand supernumeraries, I <lb/>
            should rather suppose that they were drafted off to perform the various <lb/>
            exceptional duties (over and above the work of the ten regular dicasteries) <lb/>
            for which the services of the dicasts were from time to time required. <lb/>
            Some of these are mentioned in the note on AVasps, 1108, and there were <lb/>
            many others which it is unnecessary to enumerate here. But I am not <lb/>

              dicasteries were numerically equal. We are toldn that (whilst the <lb/>
              general name of Heliæa was applicable to all the ten sections) one <lb/>
              section retained, both for itself and its Court-house, the special name of <lb/>
              the Heliæa proper as a distinctive appellation : there is some ground <lb/>
              for believing that this section, was superior to the others in dignity, <lb/>
              importance, and size : and it is not impossible that it may have consisted, <lb/>
              as one grammarian tells us it did consist, of 1500 members. However, <lb/>
              this is a point on which it is impossible to arrive at any satisfactory <lb/>
              conclusion.</p>
          <p>The ten Heliastic sections did not invariably sit as ten separate <lb/>
            assemblies : two or three sections would sometimes assemble and vote <lb/>
            together: and on very rare and special occasions the entire Heliastic <lb/>
            assembly, the Six Thousand, were summoned to form one <foreign xml:lang="grc">δικστήριον</foreign>. <lb/>
            But of course whatever the number entitled to attend any Heliastic <lb/>
            assembly, the number actually present at any one time must have been <lb/>
            liable to great variations. And there would have been as little likeli­ <lb/>
            hood that the whole nominal number would be present and vote on one <lb/>
            and the same trial, as that all the members of our English House of <lb/>
            Commons would vote in person in one and the same division. I am <lb/>
            therefore at a loss to understand what intrinsic improbability there is <lb/>
            in the proposition that the Heliastic assembly which condemned Socrates <lb/>
            to death consisted of 556 or 557 dicasts.p M.

              number of persons.</p>
          <p>It was of course only the dicasts in attendance who received their <lb/>
            pay. Each dicast, as he entered the Court-house, was presented with <lb/>
            a <foreign xml:lang="grc">σύμβολον</foreign>r or ticket of attendance. This ticket, on the rising of the <lb/>
            Court, he handed to the Treasurer (<foreign xml:lang="grc">κωλακρέτης</foreign>), who thereupon paid <lb/>
            him three obols for that day's work.</p>
          <p>The' part of the Court-house reserved for the dicastic assembly was <lb/>
            separated from the rest of the Hall by a low bar or rail (<foreign xml:lang="grc">δρύφακτοι</foreign>), <lb/>
            through which the dicasts were admitted by a little wicket (<foreign xml:lang="grc">κιγκλὶς</foreign> the <lb/>
            original of cancelli, chancel, chancery). Each sectional assembly had for <lb/>
            President one of the nine Archons, or their official Secretary : but his <lb/>
            duties during the trial were purely ministerial : he had to see that the <lb/>
            Court opened at the proper time and with the proper formalities : to <lb/>
            exclude all dicasts who came too late; and to regulate all the formal <lb/>
            proceedings of the trial. But he had himself no vote: not even, it <lb/>
            appears, a casting vote when the Assembly was equally divided in <lb/>
            opinion.</p>
          <p>The President had however the entire conduct of the proceedings <lb/>
            during the earlier stages of the suit, and until the matter was ripe for <lb/>
            the hearing: to him was entrusted the custody of the pleadings and <lb/>
            documentary evidence ; he decided on what days the <foreign xml:lang="grc">δικστήριον</foreign> should <lb/>

            of a sompnour (<foreign xml:lang="grc">κλητήρ</foreign>). The Defendant then put in an appearance to <lb/>
            the action : both the Plaintiff and Defendant made oath as to the truth <lb/>
            of their respective cases (these preliminary affidavits were called <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">α̉ντωμοσίαι</foreign>); the parties were thus at issue : and evidence was pro­ <lb/>
            duced by each of them in support of his contention.</p>
          <p>The pleadings and documentary evidence (at <foreign xml:lang="grc">γραφαὶ</foreign>), when complete, <lb/>
            were put into an official vessel (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ε̉χι̑νος</foreign>) and sealed with the official seal, <lb/>
            to be opened in Court on the day of trial. The cause was then set <lb/>
            down in the cause-lists (<foreign xml:lang="grc">αἱ σανίδες</foreign>), and came on for hearing in its turn.</p>
          <p>The assembled dicasts having heard the evidence (documentary and <lb/>
            oral) and speeches on both sides, were called upon to deliver their <lb/>
            verdict. In criminal cases the issue was of course Guilty or Not <lb/>
            Guilty : and this issue was decided by the votes of the majority. The <lb/>
            votes might be taken in several different ways : but the mode adopted <lb/>
            in the Waspst is as follows. Two urns were placed on a table. The <lb/>
            dicasts who were for finding the prisoner Guilty cast their votes into <lb/>
            the Nearer Urn : those who were for acquitting him cast theirs into <lb/>
            the Further Urn. When all had voted, the urns were emptied, the <lb/>
            numbers counted, and the result declared.</p>
          <p>In the Wasps (as in the Eumenides of Æschylus) the verdict was <lb/>
            Not Guilty. The proceedings therefore terminated with the verdict, <lb/>
            and the prisoner was set free.</p>
          <p>But if the verdict had been the other way, if the prisoner had been <lb/>
            found Guilty, the Court would have had a further duty to perform : it <lb/>
            would have had to pass sentence on the convicted offender.</p>
          <p>In some cases the law itself had annexed a particular punishment to <lb/>
            the particular offence : and the Court had merely to pronounce the <lb/>
            sentence which the law had predetermined. These were called <foreign xml:lang="grc">δίκαι <lb/>
            α̉τίμητοι</foreign>, and in such cases the office of the Court was merely <lb/>
            declaratory and ministerial: The law cloth give it, and the Court <lb/>
            awards it. <note type="footnote"> t See the <unclear>note</unclear> on Wasps, 987. </note></p><pb n="xxxv"/>
            
          <p>In other cases it devolved upon the Court itself to determine the <lb/>
            amount of the penalty: and in these cases the prisoner was allowed to <lb/>
            suggest a milder punishment than that demanded by the prosecution. <lb/>
            All know the notable example of Socrates, who, when found guilty, was <lb/>
            pressed by his friends to name some heavy fine, the exaction of which <lb/>
            might have satisfied the anger of his adversaries; but who, in his <lb/>
            proud consciousness of rectitude, not declining death, named as the <lb/>
            punishment he ought to receive, the highest honours which the State <lb/>
            could confer. The penalty demanded by the prosecution was named <lb/>
            before the trial commenced: the prisoner's alternative was of course <lb/>
            proposed only after he had been found guilty.</p>
          <p>A second division was in these cases required for the purpose of <lb/>
            determining whether the prisoner should be visited with the heavier, <lb/>
            or with the lighter, penalty. But this was taken iu a different way. <lb/>
            The dicasts had <foreign xml:lang="grc">πινάκια τιμητικὰ</foreign>. (damage-cessing tablets), over the <lb/>
            waxen surface of which they drew lines to mark their decision. A long <lb/>
            line signified the heavier, a short the lighter, penalty. The <foreign xml:lang="grc">δυσκολία</foreign> of <lb/>
            the old dicast in the Wasps is displayed by his scratching the long line <lb/>
            in every case.</p>
          <p>So sour he is, the long condemning line <lb/>
            He marks for all: then homeward like a bee, <lb/>
            Laden with wax beneath his finger-nails.</p>
          <p>I do not propose to discuss the general merits or demerits of the dicastic <lb/>
            system. It may or may not have been found to operate advantageously <lb/>
            for the political education of Athenian citizens, or otherwise for the <lb/>
            benefit of the State: but I must record my opinion, as an English <lb/>
            lawyer, that it would be difficult to devise a judicial system less adapted <lb/>
            for the due administration of justice. A large Assembly can rarely, if <lb/>
            ever, form a fit tribunal for ascertaining questions of fact, or deciding <lb/>
            questions of law. Its members lose, to a great extent, their sense of <lb/>
            individual responsibility, and it is apt to degenerate into a mere mob, <lb/>
            open to all the influences, and liable to be swayed by all the passions, <note type="footnote"> d 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="xxxvi"/>
            which stir and agitate popular meetings. A speaker addressing so <lb/>
            numerous a body must of necessity employ great emphasis of tone and <lb/>
            gesture: and even a trained audience would under the circumstances <lb/>
            find it difficult to retain the coolness and composure of mind which are <lb/>
            essential to the investigation of truth. But the members of the <lb/>
            Heliastic assemblies had received no previous training whatever. They <lb/>
            were not even selected with reference to their intellectual capacity or <lb/>
            aptitude for the task. Taken at haphazard from the general community, <lb/>
            and necessarily, as a rule, from the needy and less educated classes, <lb/>
            they were at once elevated into supreme irresponsible judges, <lb/>
            empowered in the name and with the authority of the Athenian People <lb/>
            to decide finally and without appeal every question, whether of law or <lb/>
            of fact, which might be brought before them. The only assistance they <lb/>
            received, if assistance it is to be called, was from the impassioned elo­ <lb/>
            quence of Athenian orators, men of great powers and practised ingenuity, <lb/>
            who did not scruple to appeal in the most energetic terms to prejudices <lb/>
            and passions which, whether honourable or dishonourable in themselves, <lb/>
            have no place in the due administration of justice, and which, as cal­ <lb/>
            culated to warp and bias the judicial mind, are (in theory at least) care­ <lb/>
            fully excluded from modern advocacy. And, of all people, an Athenian <lb/>
            assembly, sensitive, excitable, easily moved, quick to appreciate the <lb/>
            graces of oratory," was least calculated to resist such appeals. What <lb/>
            wonder then if the members of an Heliastic assembly were so constantly <lb/>
            carried away by their feelings, that such a term as <foreign xml:lang="grc">θορυβει̑ν</foreign>,v tumultuari, <note type="footnote"> " " The speeches," says Mr. Sewell, Dialogues of Plato, p. 142, " formed no small <lb/>

            theatre, and no road to their favourable decision was so easy as through their taste <lb/>
            and faucy." Xenophon (Mem. iv. 4. 4), speaking of the defence of Socrates before <lb/>
            the dicastery, says that he might easily have got off, had he stooped to flatter and <lb/>
            conciliate the dicasts, as others did. </note><note type="footnote"> ' <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἦν γου̑ν η̒μει̑ς ΘΟΡΥΒΗΣΩΜΕΝ</foreign>.—Wasps, 622. <foreign xml:lang="grc">μὴ ΘΟΡΥΒΗΣΗΤΕ</foreign>, says Socrates <lb/>

            agitations ?</p>
          <p>It is surprising that so practical and well-informed a writer as Mr. <lb/>
            Grotew should have fallen into the common mistake of confounding two <lb/>
            things so essentially distinct, both in principle and practice, as the <lb/>
            dicastic system at Athens, and the English system of trial by jury. <lb/>
            The two systems have hardly any point in common. It would have <lb/>
            been a complete subversion of the Athenian theory had the dicasts <lb/>
            ceased to be a popular assembly, had their number been reduced to <lb/>
            twelve, had they throughout the proceedings been supported by the <lb/>
            presence, and guided by the advice, of some experienced and impartial <lb/>
            dignitary of the law. Yet even so, their functions would have been <lb/>
            altogether different from the functions of an English Jury. The <lb/>
            distinctive feature of the English jury-system is the absolute separation <lb/>
            between the ascertainers of fact and the judges of law: the distinctive <lb/>
            feature of the Athenian dicastic system is the absolute identification of <lb/>
            the two. English jurymen are not judges. Their province, and the <lb/>
            province of the Judge, are carefully defined and distinguished. They <lb/>
            have no voice in the conduct of the trial. The Judge alone can decide <lb/>
            what evidence is admissible, what line of examination it is proper to <lb/>
            pursue, what questions may and may not be put to a witness. The Jury' <note type="footnote"> from the dicasts, <foreign xml:lang="grc">τοσούτους καὶ τηλικούτους παρὰ</foreign> run <foreign xml:lang="grc">δικαστῶν</foreign> OOPYBOY2, that I shall <lb/>

            cannot interfere. It is for the Judge alone to determine what are the <lb/>
            questions of fact to be submitted to the jury, and to state what are the <lb/>
            real points of evidence (divested of all the irrelevant matter wherewith <lb/>
            the ingenuity of the advocate may have obscured them) which, and which <lb/>
            alone, are to be weighed and considered by the Jury. If there is no <lb/>
            disputed question of fact, if the evidence is all one way, the Judge may <lb/>
            direct the Jury what verdict they must return, and they are bound to <lb/>
            obey. They are bound to take the law from the Judge. They may <lb/>
            have to find what are the facts of the case, but to draw the legal infer­ <lb/>
            ence from those factsx is beyond their power, and is the exclusive pro­ <lb/>
            vince of the Judge. The Jury can decide no question of law. And <lb/>
            even as regards those matters of fact which fall within their peculiar <lb/>
            province, their verdict in civil cases is still liable to revision: for if <lb/>
            after every precaution they come to a conclusion which the Judge con­ <lb/>
            siders unquestionably wrong, the verdict may be set aside, and a new <lb/>
            trial ordered: or the damages awarded by the Jury may be reduced <lb/>
            to a more reasonable amount.</p>
          <p>" Sufficient attention," observes Mr. Forsyth,y " has not been paid to <lb/>
            what is the distinctive characteristic of the system : viz. that the Jury <lb/>
            consists of a body of men taken from the community at large,z and <lb/>
            summoned to find the truth of disputed facts, who are quite distinct <lb/>
            from the Judges or Court. Their office is to decide upon the effect of <lb/>
            evidence, and thus inform the Court truly upon the question at issue, <lb/>
            in order that the latter may be enabled to pronounce a right judg­ <lb/>
            ment. But they are not the Court itself, nor do they form part of <note type="footnote"> x The distinction is embodied in the well-known legal maxim, " Ad quæstionem <lb/>
            juris non respondent juratores: ad quæstionem facti non respondent Judices." </note><note type="footnote"> y History of Trial by Jury, p. 8. The italics are Air. Forsyth's. "In England <lb/>
            the jury never usurped the functions of the Judge. They were originally called in to <lb/>
            aid the Court with information upon questions of fact, in order that the law might <lb/>
            be properly applied: and this has continued to be their province to the present <lb/>
            day."—Id. p. 11. </note><note type="footnote"> z Taken, that is, from their ordinary business pro hac vice. Even in this respect <lb/>
            there is no similarity between them and the Athenian dicasts, whose daily attend­ <lb/>

             <pb n="xxxix"/>
            it, and they have nothing to do with the sentence which follows the <lb/>
            delivery of the verdict."</p>
          <p>" The distinction between the province of the Judge and that of the <lb/>
            jury is in the English law clearly defined, and observed with jealous <lb/>
            accuracy.-The law throws upon the jury the whole responsibility of <lb/>
            ascertaining facts in dispute, and the Judge does not attempt to interfere <lb/>
            with the exercise of their unfettered discretion in this respect. But on <lb/>
            the other hand the Judge has his peculiar duty in the conduct of a trial. <lb/>
            He must determine whether the kind of evidence offered is such as <lb/>
            ought or ought not to be submitted to the jury, and what liabilities it <lb/>
            imposes. When any questions of law arise, he alone determines them, <lb/>
            and their consideration is absolutely withdrawn from the jury, who <lb/>
            must in such cases follow the direction of the judge : or if they <lb/>
            perversely refuse to do so, their verdict (in civil cases) will be set <lb/>
            aside, and a new trial granted.,, a</p>
          <p>Such, and so many, are the limitations and restrictions under which <lb/>
            an English jury must exercise their functions. But these limitations <lb/>
            and restrictions were not only unknown to, they would have been quite <lb/>
            inconsistent with the theory of, the Athenian dicastic assemblies, which <lb/>
            were nothing less than the Sovereign People, unassisted and without <lb/>
            appeal, deciding all questions both of law and of fact. They were <lb/>
            themselves emphatically the Court, exercising from day to day the <lb/>
            highest and most absolute judicial functions. They were Judge and <lb/>
            Jury in one : a Judge and a Jury represented by a stormy tumultuous <lb/>
            crowd of several hundred (sometimes of several thousand) untrained <lb/>
            citizens.</p>
          <p>And these formidable dicasts, Six Thousand in number, were, at the <lb/>
            time when the Wasps was written, the staunchest supporters of the <lb/>
            Athenian Demagogues. The Demagogues b professed themselves to be <lb/>
            the friends of the dicasteries, jealous in maintaining their privileges, <lb/>
            active in shielding them from all assaults of their enemies. And the <note type="footnote"> a Id. p. 282. </note><note type="footnote"> b See this fully drawn out in Wasps, 592—600. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="xl"/>
            dicasts repaid these professionsc by according an unwavering and <lb/>
            ungrudging support to patrons at once so powerful and so well <lb/>
            disposed. And thus (to take the Aristophanic view of the subject), <lb/>
            when Clean is assailed in the Knights,d he at once calls on the dicasts, <lb/>
            as his habitual supporters, to come to the rescue, <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BELL_10_fig32.jpg"/></figure> <lb/>
              while the dicasts, in their turn, when assailed in the Wasps,f at once <lb/>
              send a pressing message to Cleon, entreating him to come to their <lb/>
              immediate assistance.</p><figure type="illustration">
            <graphic url="ENG_BELL_10_fig33.jpg"/></figure>
          <p>The support of the dicasts, even considered in their dicastic capacity <lb/>
            alone, would be of inestimable service to any political leaders: for in <lb/>
            ancient communities,:: when party spirit ran high, and political prosecu­ <lb/>
            tions were common, the dicasteries became the ultimate power in the <lb/>
            state. <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BELL_10_fig34.jpg"/></figure><note type="footnote"> d Knights, 255. In fact there is reason to believe that on receiving the blow <lb/>
              which Aristophanes dealt him in the Knights, Cleon did in very truth call upon <lb/>
              his dicastic supporters to avenge him of his adversary. See the note on Wasps, <lb/>
              1285. This appeal in the Knights shows that Aristophanes was keenly alive to <lb/>
              the fact that the Demagogues mainly relied on the support of the dicasts : and <lb/>
              perhaps he was even then meditating the great effort, which he afterwards made <lb/>
              in the Wasps, to withdraw the dicasts from their misplaced allegiance. </note><note type="footnote"> e <foreign xml:lang="grc">ξυνωμοτῶν</foreign>, a very attractive bait to the <foreign xml:lang="grc">γέροντες ἡλιασταί</foreign>. See Wasps, 345 and <lb/>

          <p>But this was not the only, nor indeed the chief, advantage which the <lb/>
            Demagogues derived from their alliance with the dicasts. It is easy to <lb/>
            perceive that several thousand citizens, animated by one spirit, would <lb/>
            exercise a predominant influence in the general political assemblies of <lb/>
            the People. A cause which they heartily espoused could hardly fail of <lb/>
            success. A statesman, supported by their votes, would have little to <lb/>
            fear from the attacks of his opponents.</p>
          <p>This alliance then formed one main source and element of the power <lb/>
            of the Demagogues. And in endeavouring to break it up, and to <lb/>
            detach the dicasts from their allegiance to the popular leaders, <lb/>
            Aristophanes would in fact be attacking Cleon's position in its most <lb/>
            vital point. And such, as I have already attempted to show, was the <lb/>
            real aim and purpose of the Wasps.</p>
          <p>In addition to the more formal and technical process of an action before <lb/>
            a recognized Court of Law, the practice of referring a dispute to tho <lb/>
            decision of Arbitrators (<foreign xml:lang="grc">διαιτηταὶ</foreign>) was as well known in Athens as it is <lb/>
            in England. And it often escapes observation that we have in the <lb/>
            Wasps a complete specimen of an Arbitration as well as of an Action at <lb/>
            law. The dispute between Philocleon and his son is in set terms <lb/>
            referred to the arbitrement of tho Chorus: the matter is solemnly <lb/>
            debated before them as <foreign xml:lang="grc">διαιτηταί</foreign>: and at the close of the argument, they <lb/>
            formally deliver their Award.</p>
          <p>And even as regards the Action at law, sufficient attention has <lb/>
            hardly, I think, been given to the fact that Philocleon is made to try, in <lb/>
            parody, the very case to which his comrades were calling him at the <lb/>
            commencement of the Play. The trial between the Two Dogs is <lb/>
            the impeachment of Laches by Cleon : and not only docs the fictitious <lb/>
            name Labes sufficiently represent the Accused; but the generic <foreign xml:lang="grc">Κύων</foreign>, <lb/>
            retained for the Accuser, is equally suggestive of the name of <foreign xml:lang="grc">Κλέως</foreign>. <lb/>

            might say, ‘your ribs won't thank you <lb/>
            for this.' The parallel passage in Euri­ <lb/>
            pides (Iph. in Taur, 523), where Iphigenia <lb/>
            says of Helen, <foreign xml:lang="grc">κἀμοὶ γάρ</foreign> TL <foreign xml:lang="grc">προὐφειλει <lb/>
            κακὸν</foreign>, ' to me too she owes an atonement; <lb/>

            favour of the latter interpretation. And <lb/>
            if that Play is earlier in date than the <lb/>
            Wasps (aud there are no good grounds <lb/>
            for placing it later), there can be little <lb/>
            doubt but that Aristophanes is here <lb/>
            mimicking the Euripidean phraseology, <lb/>
            and applying it in the same sense. And <lb/>
            see note on 247 infra. Mr. Mitchell cites <lb/>
            the passage from the Iphigenia, but his <lb/>
            own translation. ‘ yon incur then a large <lb/>
            and painful debt for which your ribs <lb/>
            must pay,' is obviously incorrect; for <lb/>
            the dative signifies the persou to whom, <lb/>
            not the means by which, the payment is <lb/>
            to be made. With the general tenor of <lb/>
            the line compare Plautus, Miles Gloriosus, <lb/>

          <p>8. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀλλ</foreign>’ <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἦ</foreign>.] These words invariably <lb/>
            introduce a doubtful, hesitating question, <lb/>
            indicative of some surprise on the part <lb/>
            of the questioner: 'am I then really to <lb/>
            understand that,’ ‘can it be that you are <lb/>
            a maniae or a man possessed?’ The <lb/>
            Corybants indulged in such wild, delirious <lb/>
            orgies, that their name was identified <lb/>
            throughout Hellas with madness and <lb/>
            frenzy of every description.</p>
          <p>9. <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὕκ, ἀλλά</foreign>.] This is not an absolute <lb/>
            denial; it is rather a qualified admission. <lb/>
            Not exactly so; yet it is in truth a sleep <lb/>
            inspired by Sabazius which possesses me. <lb/>
            So infra 77, <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὕκ, ἀλλὰ φιλο μέν ἐστιν ἀρχὴ</foreign> <lb/>
            TOV <foreign xml:lang="grc">κακου̑</foreign>, and Peace, 850, OVK, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀλλὰ κἀκει̑ <lb/>
            ζω̑σιν ἀπὸ τοί των τινές</foreign>. Cf. Knights, 888. <lb/>
            To admit that he was under the influence <lb/>
            of Sabazius was in truth to admit that <lb/>
            his state was near akin to that of a <lb/>
            Corybant; for Sabazius (the Phrygian <lb/>
            Bacchus) was the son, as the Corybants <lb/>
            werethevotaries, of the Phrygian Cybele. <lb/>
            Hence Sabazius and Corybas are fre­ <lb/>
            quently named in conjunction, as in the <lb/>
            passages cited by Bergler from Lucian, <lb/>
            Deorum Concilium, cap. 9, Icaromenip. <lb/>
            cap. 27.</p>
          <p>12. <foreign xml:lang="grc">Μη̑δός τις</foreign>.] With his thoughts still <lb/>
            turned to the east, Xanthias describes the <lb/>
            overpowering influence of the sleep to <lb/>
            which he has succumbed, in language <lb/>
            borrowed from the great campaigns of <lb/>
            the Persians against Hellas. For a <lb/>
            somewhat similar metaphor see info <lb/>

          <p>XANTH. (Producing another.) Aha ! and I'm your fellow-votary there. <lb/>
            My lids too felt just now the fierce assault <lb/>
            Of a strong Median nod-compelling sleep. <lb/>
            And then I dreamed a dream; such a strange dream !</p>
          <p>Sos. And so did I: the strangest e'er I heard of. <lb/>
            But tell yours first. XANTH. Methought a monstrous eagle <lb/>
            Came flying towards the market-place, and there <lb/>
            Seized in its claws a wriggling brassy shield, <lb/>
            And bore it up in triumph to the sky, <lb/>
            And then—Cleonymus fled off and dropped it.</p>
          <p>Sos. Why then, Cleonymus is quite a riddle.</p>
          <p>nius, says, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ξένος τις ἦνκαὶ οἶοςοὐδεπώ­ <lb/>
            ποτε ἠκούσθη</foreign>.</p>
          <p>15. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐδόκουν ἀετόν</foreign>.] Of the two dreams, <lb/>
            the first is concerned with Cleonymus, <lb/>
            the second with Cleon. In the first, a <lb/>
            remarkably fine eagle is seen bearing off <lb/>
            an <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀσπὶς</foreign> to the sky, when suddenly the <lb/>
            eagle changes into Cleonymus the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀσπιδ­ <lb/>
            αποβλὴς</foreign>, who of course at once <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀποβάλλει <lb/>
            τὴν ἀσπίδα</foreign>, vilely casts away the shield. <lb/>
            There is probably a play (which it is im­ <lb/>
            possible to preserve in an English trans­ <lb/>
            lation) on the double meaning of <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀσπὶς</foreign>, <lb/>
            a shield, and a snake, "nam aquila,” as <lb/>
            Bergler observes,“ serpentes non clypeos <lb/>
            rapit;” but even before the name of <lb/>
            Cleonymus is introduced, the meaning <lb/>
            of <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀσπὶς</foreign> has become restricted to a shield <lb/>
            by the use of the epithet <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπίχαλκον</foreign>.</p>
          <p>16. <foreign xml:lang="grc">μέγαν πάνυ</foreign>.] Cleonymus the <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ῤίψασπις</foreign> was a man of great stature, a <lb/>
            circumstance which rendered his coward­ <lb/>
            ice at once wore conspicuous and more <lb/>
            disgraceful. Aristophanes frequently <lb/>
            alludes to the fact. In the Acharnians <lb/>
            (88), the ambassadors attempt to convey <lb/>
            some notion of the prodigious size of the <lb/>
            bird served up for their dinner, by de­ <lb/>
            claring that it was thrice as big as <lb/>
            Cleonymus. And the Cleonymus-tree <lb/>
            which the Birds (1475) discovered in <lb/>
            their wanderings, the tree which shed <lb/>
            shields Instead of leaves, was a large tree <lb/>
            with no heart, <foreign xml:lang="grc">δειλὸν</foreign> Kai <foreign xml:lang="grc">μέγα</foreign>. And see <lb/>

          <p>22. TL <foreign xml:lang="grc">ταυτόν</foreign>.] Sosias is appropriating <lb/>
            a very ancient and well-known riddle, <lb/>
            preserved in Athenæus, x. 78 (to which <lb/>
            Dobree also refers). The question was <lb/>

            sky.</p>
          <p>26. <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐδὲν ἒσται δεινόν</foreign>.] No harm will <lb/>
            come of it. In Alciphron, iii. 47, a thief, <lb/>
            rejoicing over his lucky escape with his <lb/>

          <p>28. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐστὶν μέγα</foreign>.] The first dream was <lb/>
            a mere private satire; it affected no <lb/>
            great political interest. The second <lb/>
            dream is of high public import; it con­ <lb/>
            cerns the general welfare of the state <lb/>
            and indeed bears closely upon the special <lb/>
            purpose of the Play. It represents the <lb/>
            great demagogue, with his loud, cruel <lb/>
            voice (<foreign xml:lang="grc">φωνὴ μιαρὰ</foreign>), addressing the as­ <lb/>

            ing open-mouthed to his harangue, and <lb/>
            eager to support whatever proposition <lb/>
            he may make.</p>
          <p>30. <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὴν τρόπιν</foreign>.] Possibly, as Bergler <lb/>
            says, there may be a play on the words <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸντρόπον τοῦ πράγματος</foreign>; but more pro­ <lb/>

            humouredly, rose from their seats, and <lb/>
            broke up the assembly. The Scholiast <lb/>
            here explains <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐκκλησιάξειν</foreign> by <foreign xml:lang="grc">εἰςἐκκλη­ <lb/>
            σίαν συνάγειν</foreign>, which, as Bp. Pearson (on <lb/>
            the Creel, Art. ix.) pointed out, is an <lb/>
            obvious error; it means to attend an <lb/>
            assembly.’</p>

            the sheep were clad in the ordinary garb <lb/>
            of Athenian citizens, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐκκληιαξόντων</foreign>, at­ <lb/>
            tending an assembly. For the Athenians <lb/>
            (unlike the Spartans) took their sticks <lb/>
            with them as well as their clokes. And <lb/>
            therefore Praxagora in the Ecclesiazusæ, <lb/>
            whilst dressing up the women to attend <lb/>
            the assembly as men, is careful to see <lb/>
            that they are all provided with sticks <lb/>
            and clokes:— <figure type="illustration">

            x. 14, " Quanto delphinis balæna Britan­ <lb/>
            nica major," the name balæna (the Latin <lb/>
            form of <foreign xml:lang="grc">φάλαινα</foreign>) is generally taken to <lb/>
            signify a grampus; and no doubt the <lb/>
            epithet <foreign xml:lang="grc">πανδοκεύτρια</foreign> is as applicable to <lb/>
            the grampus as to other cetaceans. " It <lb/>
            is a very wolf in its constant hunger," <lb/>
            says a recent writer, "and commits <lb/>
            great havoc among the larger fish, such <lb/>
            as the cod, the skate, and the halibut. <lb/>
            Even the smaller porpoises and dolphins <lb/>
            fall victims to the insatiable appetite of <lb/>
            the grampus" (Wood's Natural History, <lb/>
            i. 544). Nor, if we are to give credit to <lb/>
            the concurrent testimony of ancient wit­ <lb/>
            nesses, was the rapacity of Cleon less <lb/>
            boundless than that of a grampus or an <lb/>
            omnivorous cormorant (Clouds, 591). The <lb/>
            Knights of course is full to overflowing <lb/>
            of imputations of this nature. In the <lb/>
            Acharnians (line 6) a special instance <lb/>
            is mentioned, which is also recorded by <lb/>

              drove men over to the party of Nicias. <lb/>
              And in his Præcepta gerendæ Reipublicæ <lb/>
              xiii., after relating that Cleon, when he <lb/>
              first engaged in politics, dissolved all <lb/>
              his private friendships, he adds, “ it had <lb/>
              been better had he cast out of his soul <lb/>
              his love of wealth and brawling, had he <lb/>
              purged himself from envy and malice, <lb/>
              for states require not the friendless and <lb/>
              companionless, but the wise and good. <lb/>
              And Cleon, though he discarded his <lb/>
              friends, yet kept a hundred flatterers to <lb/>
              beslaver around his head." See also <lb/>

            of a burnt (Lysistrata 322), singed or <lb/>
            scalded sow. This high-pitched truculent <lb/>
            voice is everywhere put prominently <lb/>
            forward in the Aristophanic portrait of <lb/>
            Cleon. In the Knights 218, when setting <lb/>
            up a rival to Cleon, he specifies a <foreign xml:lang="grc">φωνὴ <lb/>
            μιαρὰ</foreign> as the very first qualification for <lb/>

            Your dream smells horribly of putrid hides.</p>
          <p>Sos. Then the vile grampus, scales in hand, weighed out <lb/>
            Bits of fat beef, cut up. XANTH. Woe worth the day ! <lb/>
            He means to cut our city up in bits.</p>
          <p>Play Cleou is described as <foreign xml:lang="grc">κεκράκτης, <lb/>

            304, 487,1018), and his final doom (1403) <lb/>
            is to bawl in rivalry with prostitutes <lb/>
            and watermen. So infra 596, lie is de­ <lb/>
            scribed as <foreign xml:lang="grc">κεκραξιδάμας</foreign>, and infra 1034, <lb/>
            and Peace, 757, as having <foreign xml:lang="grc">φωνὴν χαράδρας <lb/>
            ὄλεθρον τετοκυίας</foreign>. And this loud voice <lb/>
            accorded well with his violent and ex­ <lb/>
            cited manner of speaking. “ He was <lb/>
            the first," says Plutarch (Nicias, cap. 8; <lb/>
            Tiberius Gracchus, cap. 2), who banished <lb/>
            decorum from the bema, rushing to <lb/>
            and fro while he spoke, shouting at the <lb/>
            top of his voice (<foreign xml:lang="grc">πρῶτος ἐν τῷ δημηγορεῖν <lb/>
            ἀνακραγὼν</foreign>), throwing back his cloke, and <lb/>
            slapping his thigh." What an inno­ <lb/>
            vation this was upon the established <lb/>
            mode of oratory may be judged from <lb/>
            the statement of Æschines adv. Timar­ <lb/>
            chum, cap. 6. The Scholiast on Lucian's <lb/>
            Timon, cap. 30, says of Cleon, <foreign xml:lang="grc">πρῶτος <lb/>
            δημηγορῶν ἀνέκραγεν ἐπὶ τοῦ βήματοςκαὶ <lb/>

            τῶν πολιτῶν</foreign>.</p>
          <p>37. <foreign xml:lang="grc">αἰβοῖ</foreign>.] The double hint, from the <lb/>
            boundless rapacity and the vociferous <lb/>
            tones of the portent, has disclosed the <lb/>
            secret; and Xantliias perceives that the <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">φάλαινα πανδοκεύτρια</foreign> can be no other than <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὁβυρσοπώλς ὃςἐκύκα τὴν Ὲλλάδα</foreign>. Berg­ <lb/>
            ler refers to Knights, 892, where Demus <lb/>
            says to Cleon, <foreign xml:lang="grc">αἰβοῖ οὐκἐς κόρακας ἀπο­ <lb/>
            φθερεῖ, βύρσης κάκιστον ὄξων</foreign>; And indeed <lb/>
            Aristophanes is constantly alluding to <lb/>
            Cleon's unsavoury trade. See infra 1035, <lb/>
            and the Knights passim. For the ex­ <lb/>
            pression <foreign xml:lang="grc">παῦε παῦε μὴ λέγε</foreign>, see Peace, 648.</p>
          <p>40. <foreign xml:lang="grc">βόειον δημόν</foreign>.] Bergler refers to <lb/>
            Knights, 954, for a similar play on the <lb/>
            words <foreign xml:lang="grc">δημὸς</foreign>, fut, and <foreign xml:lang="grc">δῆμος</foreign>, the people.</p>
          <p>41. <foreign xml:lang="grc">δμστάναι</foreign>.] To split up, sever into <lb/>
            parts. The expression <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸν δῆμον διιστάναι</foreign> <lb/>
            is here commonly taken in the meta­ <lb/>
            phorical sense of sowing discord aud <lb/>
            division amongst the people. And this <lb/>
            may no doubt be its meaning. It is <lb/>
            however to be observed that in Knights, <lb/>
            818, Cleon is described as <foreign xml:lang="grc">διατειχίξων</foreign> <lb/>
            (see Casaubon's note there) in contrast <lb/>
            to Themistocles, whose long walls had <lb/>
            blended the Piræus and Athens into one <lb/>
            great city. And I cannot help thinking <lb/>
            that here too Aristophanes is alluding <lb/>
            to some scheme of internal fortification <lb/>
            which Clean had proposed, and which <lb/>
            would have had the effect of splitting up <lb/>
            the city into distinct wards, each with <lb/>
            its own separate circumvallation. <note type="footnote"> C </note></p><pb n="10"/>

            hundred flatterers (<foreign xml:lang="grc">κόλακες</foreign>), see infra <lb/>
            1033, who hung and fluttered about the <lb/>
            more powerful demagogue. See infra <lb/>
            418 and 1236. In the present panto­ <lb/>
            mimic vision he is represented with the <lb/>
            head of a crow (<foreign xml:lang="grc">τὴν κεφαλἠν κόρακος ἔχων</foreign>) <lb/>
            keeping close to his great patron (<foreign xml:lang="grc">αὐτη̑ς <lb/>

            foot of the Bema.</p>
          <p>44. <foreign xml:lang="grc">᾽Αλκιβάδης</foreign>.] This passage, as <lb/>
            Brunck observes, is cited by Plutarch <lb/>
            at the commencement of his Life of <lb/>
            Alcibiades. Plutarch says that the lisp <lb/>
            of Alcibiades was very graceful and <lb/>
            winning, and lent a singular charm and <lb/>
            persuasiveness to his speech.</p>
          <p>45. <foreign xml:lang="grc">κόλακος</foreign>.] The happy lisp of Alci­ <lb/>
            biades has affixed to Theorus his true <lb/>
            designation, <foreign xml:lang="grc">κόλαξ</foreign>, a flatterer. The simi­ <lb/>
            larity of the two words <foreign xml:lang="grc">κὐραξ</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">κόλαξ</foreign> <lb/>
            afforded a ready opening for Hellenic wit. <lb/>
            Brunck refers to an epigram of Palladas <lb/>
            (Brunck's Aualecta, ii. 413), <foreign xml:lang="grc">᾽Ρω̑ καὶ <lb/>
            λάμβδα μόνον κόρακας κολάκων διορίζει</foreign>, and <lb/>
            a maxim of Diogenes, recorded by Athe­ <lb/>
            næus, vi. 65. “It is far better," said <lb/>
            Diogenes, "to go to the crows than to the <lb/>

            when dead, but these while you are yet <lb/>
            alive." I may add Lucian's Timon, 48 <lb/>
            (i. p. 116, ed. Bipont), where Philiades <lb/>
            says, <foreign xml:lang="grc">χαῖρε, ὦδέσποτα, καὶ τοὺς <lb/>

            Being a man he straight becomes a crow: <lb/>
            Is it not obvious to conjecture that <lb/>
            He's going to leave us, going to the crows ?</p>
          <p>Sos. Shall I not pay two obols then, and hire <lb/>
            One who so cleverly interprets dreams ?</p>

            to the crows "-the equivalent of our <lb/>
            vulgar phrase “going to the dogs,"­ <lb/>
            supplied the material for innumerable <lb/>

            was no longer Ganymede in gorgeous <lb/>

            terus, as naked as his mother bore him. <lb/>

            the actual plot or story which he is <lb/>
            about to unfold, but the preliminary <lb/>
            circumstances, a knowledge of which <lb/>
            is requisite for the right understanding <lb/>
            of the Play. See Peace, 50 ; where (as <lb/>
            also in the Knights) Aristophanes follows <lb/>
            the same inartificial method, which he <lb/>
            here employs, for putting the audience <lb/>

            tists were fond of contrasting their own <lb/>
            cultivated and highly finished perfor­ <lb/>
            mances, with the rude and homely tricks <lb/>
            wherewith the primitive comedians of <lb/>
            Megara sought to divert their audience. <lb/>
            The Scholiast cites a passage from the <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ΙΙροσπάλτιοι</foreign> of Eupolis, <figure type="illustration">

              which is given more fully by Aspasins <lb/>
              on the Ethics, iv. 2 (to which Person <lb/>
              refers). And Aspasius adds, <foreign xml:lang="grc">διαύρονται <lb/>

            <foreign xml:lang="grc">κάρυα</foreign> as the generic name for every <lb/>
            species of nut. <foreign xml:lang="grc">οἱ 'Αττικοὶ κοινω̂ς πάντα τὰ <lb/>

            Brunck observes that the practice here <lb/>
            disclaimed (though apparently adopted <lb/>
            in the Peace, 962) is expressly censured <lb/>

              For in fact all this scrambling for bon­ <lb/>
              bons, these stock jokes on Heracles, this <lb/>
              Megaric buffoonery, formed part of the <lb/>
              <foreign xml:lang="grc">φόρτος</foreign>, the vulgar rubbish which Aristo­ <lb/>
              phanes had endeavoured to sweep from <lb/>
              the Athenian stage. See the Parabases <lb/>
              of the Clouds, and the Peace, and the <lb/>

          <p>With just these few remarks, by way of preface. <lb/>
            Expect not from us something mighty grand, <lb/>
            Nor yet some mirth purloined from Megara. <lb/>
            We have no brace of servants here, to scatter <lb/>
            Nuts from their basket out among the audience, <lb/>
            No Heracles defrauded of his supper, <lb/>
            Nor yet Euripides besmirched again; <lb/>
            No, nor though Cleon shine, by fortune's favour,</p>
          <p>strong for him however. He was un­ <lb/>
            successful with his favourite comedy of <lb/>
            the Clouds, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὑπ' ἀνδρω̑ν φορτικω̑ν ἡττηθεὶς</foreign>, <lb/>
            and he is now compelled to accommodate <lb/>
            himself in some degree to the lower <lb/>
            tastes of his audience, although his <lb/>
            Play is still, he protests, very far supe­ <lb/>

          <p>61. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀνασελγαινόμενος</foreign>.] This word would <lb/>
            mean, if the passive participle, treated <lb/>
            insolently again, and if the middle, be­ <lb/>
            having insolently again. The former <lb/>
            interpretation is generally adopted ; and <lb/>
            having regard to the passive participle <lb/>
            in the preceding line, and to the charac­ <lb/>
            ter in which Euripides is portrayed as <lb/>
            well in the Acharnians as in the later <lb/>
            plays of Aristophanes, I think that it <lb/>
            is undoubtedly the true one. The Scho­ <lb/>
            liast explains the word by <foreign xml:lang="grc">κατακωμῳδού­ <lb/>

          <p>62. <foreign xml:lang="grc">Κλέων</foreign>.] At the time when the <lb/>
            Wasps was exhibited, there was an un­ <lb/>
            usual stir and activity in the docks and <lb/>
            arsenals of Athens; a great fleet was <lb/>
            being equipped in Piræus; a splendid <lb/>
            army was mustering in the city. They <lb/>
            were bound for the coasts of Thrace; <lb/>
            and the commander-in-chief was to be <lb/>
            none other than Cleon. His success at <lb/>
            Spliacteria had been followed by the <lb/>
            entire defeat of the Athenian troops <lb/>
            under their regular officers at Delium; <lb/>
            and now he was to be once more allowed <lb/>
            to try his fortune in the field of battle. <lb/>
            And had he again returned victorious, he <lb/>
            would no doubt have become the most <lb/>
            considerable personage in Hellas. The <lb/>
            conjunction of Demagogue and General <lb/>
            in one person had at all times been re­ <lb/>
            garded as of evil omen to liberty; for, as <lb/>
            Aristotle says, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπὶ τω̑ν ἀρχαίων, ὄτε γένοιτο</foreign> <lb/>
            6 <foreign xml:lang="grc">αὐτὸς δημαγωγὸς καὶ στρατηγὸς, εὶς τυραν­ <lb/>

            new and brilliant exaltation of Clean that <lb/>
            Aristophanes is in my judgment alluding <lb/>
            in the text, and again in lines 1234, 5. <lb/>
            There is not the slightest ground for <lb/>
            Reiske's notion that ' Cleon' was the <lb/>
            original name of the Knights, and that <lb/>
            Aristophanes is here referring to the <lb/>
            success of his own comedy. As to <foreign xml:lang="grc">μυτ­ <lb/>

            compare the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπὶ του̑ δώματος</foreign>, on the house­ <lb/>
            top, of the LXX. and Evangelists. The <lb/>

            although adopted by every commentator, <lb/>
            is unquestionably erroneous; it is mani­ <lb/>
            fest from 143—148 infra that Bdelycleon <lb/>
            is actually on the roof; and indeed the <lb/>

            to which they themselves were addicted. <lb/>
            Amynias was a gambler, Dercylus a <lb/>

            You see that great big man, the man asleep <lb/>
            Up on the roof, aloft: well that's our master. <lb/>
            He keeps his father here, shut up within, <lb/>
            And bids us guard him that he stir not out. <lb/>
            For he, the father, has a strange disease, <lb/>
            Which none of yon will know, or yet conjecture, <lb/>
            Unless we tell: else, if you think so, guess. <lb/>
            Amynias there, the son of Pronapus, <lb/>

          <p>Sos. Ah,he conjectures from his own disease.</p>
          <p>XANTH. Nay, but the word does really end with -lover. <lb/>
            Then Sosias here observes to Dercylus, <lb/>

            slave; viz. (1) the identity of the name, <lb/>
            (2) the use of the pronoun <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὁδὶ</foreign>, which <lb/>
            could hardly have been intended to de­ <lb/>
            signate another Sosias farther from the <lb/>

            which was in fact the fellow-slave's <lb/>
            disease, so that he too would be <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀφ' <lb/>

            of surpassing grace and beauty, and was <lb/>
            at this time " the toast of all the town." <lb/>

              aptly compares the passage in the Aulula­ <lb/>

              been scratching about in the presence of <lb/>
              the intruding cooks, near the spot where <lb/>
              the crock of gold was hidden, and Euclio <lb/>

            pronounce the sentence. And in many <lb/>
            cases, the prosecutor and the prisoner <lb/>
            were each allowed to propose the penalty <lb/>
            to be inflicted. In such cases the judges <lb/>
            declared their opinions by drawing a line <lb/>
            on the <foreign xml:lang="grc">πινάκιον τιμητικὸν</foreign>, a tablet faced <lb/>

            in favour of the lighter penalty substi­ <lb/>
            tuted by the prisoner, drew a short line. <lb/>
            Philocleon's <foreign xml:lang="grc">δυσκολία</foreign> (see the note on <lb/>
            1356 infra) induced him to award in <lb/>

            Air. Tennyson's Boadicea has for the <lb/>

          <p>Lest he lack votes, he keeps, to judge withal, <lb/>

            Such is his frenzy, and the more you chide him <lb/>
            The more he judges : so with bolts and bars <lb/>
            We guard him straitly that he stir not out. <lb/>
            For ill the young man brooks his sire's disease. <lb/>
            And first he tried by soft emollient words <lb/>
            To win him over, not to don the cloke <lb/>
            Or walk abroad : but never a jot he yielded. <lb/>
            He washed and purged him then: but never a jot. <lb/>
            A Corybant next he made him, but old master, <lb/>
            Timbrel and all, into the New Court bursts <lb/>
            And there sits judging. So when these rites failed, <lb/>
            We cross the Strait, and, in Ægina, place him, <lb/>

          <p>In the Lysistrata (388) Aristophanes <lb/>

            determine the names of the ten courts in <lb/>
            which the Athenian dicasts held their <lb/>

            Τρίγωνον, Μέσον</foreign>. The whole subject is <lb/>

            Fritzsche (De Sortitione Judicum), and <lb/>
            others, with great care, but without, as I <lb/>
            think, any satisfactory result. And it <lb/>
            seems not improbable that there were <lb/>
            never ten specifically apl ropriated courts. <lb/>
            but that the dicasts were from time to <lb/>
            time accommodated in any large halls or <lb/>
            other public buildings available and con­ <lb/>
            venient for the purpose.</p>

            of Æsculapius, to be recovered of their <lb/>
            diseases. In the Plutus the experiment <lb/>
            is tried upon Plutus himself, with very <lb/>
            remarkable success. In the Curculio <lb/>

            to fly back and let his beloved pass <lb/>
            through. The serenade is a singular <lb/>

            of it:-</p><pb n="22"/>

            Curculio is laid in Epidaurus, which <lb/>
            was the headquarters of the worship of <lb/>
            Æsculapius; but Ægina was partly <lb/>
            inhabited by Epidaurian colonists, and <lb/>
            therefore naturally possessed a temple <lb/>
            of the special Epidaurian divinity. See <lb/>

          <p>151. <foreign xml:lang="grc">Καπνιου</foreign>.] Why Bdelycleon should <lb/>

            prospect of being called <foreign xml:lang="grc">υἱὸς Καπνίόυ</foreign> is a <lb/>
            mystery. There was, as the Scholiast <lb/>
            observes, a wine so called; a wine of <lb/>
            Beneventum, so tart and bitter as to <lb/>
            bring tears into the eyes. Again, the <lb/>
            old comedian Ecphantides (mentioned in <lb/>
            the note on 57 supra) received the nick­ <lb/>
            name of <foreign xml:lang="grc">Καπνίας</foreign> from his age and obscu­ <lb/>
            rity; see Hesychius s. v. But I do not <lb/>
            see that these suggestions afford any <lb/>
            solution of the difficulty. And it seems <lb/>
            to me more probable that <foreign xml:lang="grc">Καπνίας</foreign> was the <lb/>
            name of some disreputable Athenian of <lb/>
            the day; a name possibly quite uncon­ <lb/>
            nected with <foreign xml:lang="grc">καπνὸς</foreign>, smoke; and heuce <lb/>
            the first syllable is long.</p>

            through the door. Sosias calls out; <lb/>

            of the word <foreign xml:lang="grc">βάλανος</foreign>, which signifies (1) <lb/>
            an acorn, and (2) a door-pin. It might <lb/>

            'to carry but not to shelter you.' Each <lb/>
            party insisted on his view of the bargain, <lb/>
            neither would give way, and finally they <lb/>
            went to law about it." The orator <lb/>
            ceased, but the judges clamoured to <lb/>
            know the result ofthe dispute. " What!" <lb/>
            said Demosthenes, rcasccnding the bema, <lb/>
            "are ye so interested in a dispute about <lb/>
            a donkey's shadow (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ὑπὲρ ὄνου σκια̑ς</foreign>), and <lb/>
            yet in a matter of life and death (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ὑπὲρ <lb/>
            ψυχη̑ς</foreign>) will not even take the trouble to <lb/>
            listen ? " However, to my mind the <lb/>
            notoriety of the proverb strongly mili­ <lb/>
            tates against the literal accuracy of the <lb/>
            anecdote.</p>
          <p>192. <foreign xml:lang="grc">πόρρω τέχνης</foreign>.] <foreign xml:lang="grc">πόρρω</foreign> involves the <lb/>
            notion of an advance forward; and, when <lb/>
            used with a genitive, may mean either <lb/>
            ' far advanced in,' or' far advance from.' <lb/>
            It is quite possible therefore that <foreign xml:lang="grc">πόρρω <lb/>
            τέχνης</foreign> might signify, as Mitchell says, <lb/>
            far advanced in artifice. But on the <lb/>
            whole I agree with the Scholiast, <lb/>
            and the general body of commentators, <lb/>
            in taking it as equivalent to <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀτεχνω̑ς</foreign>. <lb/>
            The expression is of course applied not <lb/>
            to Philocleon (who is full of tricks, <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">τεχνώμενος</foreign>, supr. 176), but to his <foreign xml:lang="grc">πονηρία</foreign>, <lb/>
            which is not artificial, but natural and <lb/>
            genuine. <foreign xml:lang="grc">Οὐκ ἀπὸ τέχνης τινὸς πονηρὸς εἴ</foreign>, <lb/>

            likened the old man to the foal of an <lb/>
            ass, and called him <foreign xml:lang="grc">πονηρὸς</foreign>, which Philo­ <lb/>
            clcon understands in the sense of corrupt <lb/>
            tainted meat (<foreign xml:lang="grc">λέγουσι τινὲς</foreign> Kat <foreign xml:lang="grc">πονηρὰ κρέα <lb/>
            ἀντὶ του̂ σαπρά</foreign>.—Scholiast), and retorts, <lb/>
            "Wait till you taste my <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὑπογάστριον</foreign>." <lb/>
            For the stuffed paunch of an ass was <lb/>

            as it used to be considered, the accusa­ <lb/>
            tive after <foreign xml:lang="grc">προσθεὶς</foreign>, we should be obliged, <lb/>

            the sudden ejaculation of Sosias ; but <lb/>
            this can 'scarcely be right.</p>

            securing the door, Sosias is startled by <lb/>
            something falling upon his head. Philo­ <lb/>
            cleon has in fact shifted his position, <lb/>

            upon the top of the house.</p>
          <p>206. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὀροφίας</foreign>.] This was the special <lb/>
            epithet of a race of snakes, which in­ <lb/>
            rested the rafters and roofs of Greek <lb/>
            houses. Hesychius s.v.; Pollux, vii. segm. <lb/>
            120; Eustathius on Odyssey, ii. 337. The <lb/>
            Scholiast's idea that the epithet was <lb/>
            applied to mice as well as to snakes <lb/>
            seems to be quite groundless, and is pro­ <lb/>
            bably derived from a faulty interpreta­ <lb/>
            tion of the passage before us. Conz <lb/>
            suggests that there is a pun in the word <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἡλιαστὴς</foreign>, "quod sumi possit de serpente <lb/>

          <p>210. <foreign xml:lang="grc">Σκιώνην</foreign>.] Scione, on the peninsula <lb/>
            of Pallene, was at the time closely be­ <lb/>
            sieged by a large Athenian force. The <pb n="32"/>
            <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BELL_10_fig87.jpg"/></figure> <lb/>
              siege had been commenced in the pre­ <lb/>
              ceding year ; a wall of circumvallation <lb/>
              had been drawn around the doomed <lb/>
              town; and its inhabitants were cut off <lb/>
              from all communication with the outer <lb/>
              world. Yet they held out for two years; <lb/>
              and the summer of B.C. 421 was far ad­ <lb/>
              vanced before they were reduced to sur­ <lb/>
              render. The story of this little town, <lb/>
              its bright hopes and tragical end, is one <lb/>
              of the saddest episodes in the pages of <lb/>
              Thucydides.</p>
          <p>213. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὅσον ὅσον στίλην</foreign>.] The double <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὅσον</foreign> here seems mainly due to the <lb/>
            drowsiness of the speaker, though <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὅσον <lb/>
            ὅσον</foreign>, in time, acquired a distinct mean­ <lb/>
            ing of its own : <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἔτι γὰρ μικρὸν ὅσον ὅσον, <lb/>

            ' a drop of sleep,' compare the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ψακὰς <lb/>
            ἀργυρίου</foreign> of Peace, 121, and the " gutta <lb/>

          <p>216. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὄρθρος βαθύς</foreign>.] The dim twilight <lb/>
            that precedes the dawn. Plato in the <lb/>
            Protagoras reckons it as a part of the <lb/>
            night-season,<foreign xml:lang="grc">τῆς παρελθούσης νυκτὸςταυτη­ <lb/>
            σὶ, ἔτι βαθέος ὄρθρου</foreign>, 310 A. The phrase <lb/>
            is used again by Plato (Crito ad init.: <lb/>
            the two passages from Plato are cited by <lb/>
            Mitchell); by St. Luke (Evang. xxiv. 1); <lb/>
            by Theocritus (Epithalamium Helenæ, <lb/>
            14); and by other writers. Mr. Calverley, <lb/>
            in his pleasant version of Theocritus, is <lb/>
            misled by the ordinary meaning of <foreign xml:lang="grc">βαθὺς</foreign> <lb/>
            into translating <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὄρθρος βαθὺς</foreign> ' deep into <lb/>
            the day.' But the epithet <foreign xml:lang="grc">βαθὺς</foreign> implies <lb/>
            that the thick dulness of night has not <lb/>
            yet yielded to the clear transparency of <lb/>
            day. So when the shades of evening <lb/>
            are closing and deepening into night it <lb/>
            is <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἑσπέρα βαθεῖα</foreign> (Achilles Tatius, ii. 18; <lb/>
            Heliodorus, v.21); night itself is <foreign xml:lang="grc">νὺξ βαθεῖα</foreign> <lb/>
            (Plutarch de Pyth. Orac. ad init.; Helio­ <lb/>
            dorus, viii. 12); and in the depth or dead <lb/>
            of night we are it, <foreign xml:lang="grc">βαθυτάτῃ νυκτί</foreign> (St. <lb/>
            Chrys. Hom. x. in Matt. 146 c). One of <lb/>
            the meanings attributed by Hesychius <lb/>
            to <foreign xml:lang="grc">βαθὺ</foreign> is <foreign xml:lang="grc">μέλαν</foreign>, which may possibly <lb/>
            refer to this very usage. That it was <lb/>

            he was somewhat eclipsed by the rising <lb/>
            splendour of Æsohylus. His tragedies <lb/>
            were of a lyrical character, full of dance <lb/>
            and song. The actor said little, but the <lb/>
            chorus poured forth melody after melody, <lb/>
            strung together like beads on a neck­ <lb/>
            lace: see Frogs, 910—915. "Phrynichus, <lb/>
            says the Scholiast on this place, had a <lb/>
            mighty name for making of songs : and <lb/>

            problem of Aristotle's [Probl. xix. 13] <lb/>
            Why did Phrynichus make more songs <lb/>
            than any tragedian noir-a-days? And <lb/>
            he answers it, Was it because at that <lb/>
            time the songs (sung by the chorus) in <lb/>

            supported by very considerable authority, <lb/>
            but it is not now found in the best <lb/>
            Aristophanic MSS. The Phœnissæ was <lb/>
            probably acted about fifty-four years be­ <lb/>
            fore the Wasps; and was therefore first <lb/>
            witnessed by the chorus in that fresh <lb/>
            early youth (see note on 236 infra) when <lb/>
            the mind is most susceptible, and the <lb/>
            memory most retentive. It was similar <lb/>
            in plot to the Persæ of Æschylus (see <lb/>
            Bp. Blomfield's preface to the latter <lb/>
            Play), and derived its name from a chorus <lb/>
            of Sidonian damsels, who doubtless <lb/>

            and tender threnodies over their sailor <lb/>

            Salamis. Very few fragments of the <lb/>

            They leap, and strike at you, like sparks of fire.</p>

            are dressed up to resemble Wasps, and <lb/>
            are armed with formidable stings. In <lb/>
            their youth they had fought bravely for <lb/>
            Athens, but now they are decrepit <lb/>
            necessitous old men, earning a scanty <lb/>
            subsistence by their dicastic pay. The <lb/>
            Coryphæus is mustering his troop, and <lb/>
            exhorting them, by every argument he <lb/>
            can suggest, to quicken their palsied <lb/>
            footsteps. They pick their way slowly <lb/>
            on, their sons carrying lanterns by their <lb/>
            side; and everywhere the contrast be­ <lb/>
            tween their public self-importance and <lb/>
            domestic penury is sharply and vividly <lb/>
            brought out. And their entrance is <lb/>
            made, not to the brisk trochaic move­ <lb/>
            ment, but to a slow, halting measure, <lb/>
            the iambic tetrameter catalectic. In the <lb/>

            heroic times which culminated in the <lb/>
            victories of Cimon about half a century <lb/>
            before. The capture of Byzantium (Thuc. <lb/>

            Tliuc. i. 98), and the storming of many <lb/>

            phrases as <foreign xml:lang="grc">κατέαγα τοῦ κρανίου</foreign> are perhaps <lb/>

            lawless feats of their youth, as was <lb/>
            Justice Shallow in Shakespeare's King <lb/>
            Henry the Fourth. See infra 354.</p>

            mysterious vagueness of the language <lb/>
            makes it all the more impressive. <lb/>
            Laches, a rude gallant soldier of the <lb/>

            with twenty ships to Sicily, B.C. 427, <lb/>
            nearly five years before the date of the <lb/>
            Wasps. The expedition was sent out in <lb/>
            answer to the memorable embassy from <lb/>
            Leontini, of which the sophist Gorgias <lb/>
            had been the rhetorical spokesman (Dio­ <lb/>
            dorus, xii. 53; Plato, Hippias Major, 282 <lb/>
            B), and to which Aristophanes in the <lb/>
            Parabasis of the Acharnians (636-640) <lb/>
            is supposed to refer (Ranke, Vit. Aristoph. <lb/>
            §33, Thiersch); but the commanders were <lb/>
            instructed to take advantage of any <lb/>
            opening which might increase the in­ <lb/>

          <p>All! here it strains, the poor remains, alas ! alas ! alack the day, <lb/>
            Of that mad set, I mind it yet, when once we paced our nightly round, <lb/>
            In years gone by, both you and I, along Byzantium's wall, and found <lb/>
            And stole away the baker's tray, and sliced it up, and chopped it well, <lb/>
            A merry blaze therewith to raise, and so we cooked our pimpernel. <lb/>
            On, on again, with might and main: for Laches' turn is come to-day: <lb/>
            Quick, look alive, a splendid hive of wealth the fellow's got, they say. <lb/>
            And Cleon too, our patron true, enjoined us each betimes to bring <lb/>
            Of anger sore, an ample store, a good three days' provisioning :</p>
          <p>mate subjugation of Sicily (Thuc. iii. 86). <lb/>
            Laches, however, effected little in this <lb/>
            respect; and two years later he was <lb/>
            superseded by Pythodorus (Thuc. iii. <lb/>
            115): <foreign xml:lang="grc">εἰκὸς οὖν</foreign>, says the Scholiast, <foreign xml:lang="grc">μετα­ <lb/>
            κληθῆναι αὐτὸν ἐπὶ τὴν κρίσιν ἧς νῦν ὁ <lb/>
            Κωμικὸς μνημονεύει</foreign>. Such was certainly <lb/>
            the fate of his successors, who were fined <lb/>
            or banished for accepting bribes (Thuc. <lb/>
            iv. 65). And there can indeed be no <lb/>
            doubt that Aristophanes is here alluding <lb/>
            to a real historical incident, and that <lb/>
            Laches was in fact accused by Cleon of <lb/>
            peculation in his command; his real <lb/>
            offence being, according to our poet, <lb/>
            that although he had made ‘a pot of <lb/>
            money' (<foreign xml:lang="grc">σίμβλον χρηάτων</foreign>), he had not <lb/>
            admitted his accuser to a share of his <lb/>
            gains. Compare Knights 438–140. The <lb/>
            charge, however, appears to have made <lb/>
            but little impression ; for we find Laches, <lb/>
            soon after his recall from Sicily, and <lb/>
            thenceforward to the end of his life, <lb/>
            holding a high and honourable position <lb/>
            in the Athenian Republic. It was he <lb/>
            who, in the spring of B.C. 423, a year <lb/>
            before the date of the Wasps, was put <lb/>
            forward to move the confirmation by the <lb/>
            Assembly of the one year's truce with <lb/>
            the Spartans (Thuc. iv. 118); for whose <lb/>
            military prowess he seems to have enter­ <lb/>
            tained a profound respect (Plato, Laches, <lb/>
            cap. 6); and five years afterwards he <lb/>
            fell fighting against them in the battle of <lb/>
            Mantinea, a battle disastrous, but no way <lb/>
            inglorious, to the Athenian arms (Thuc. <lb/>
            v. 61, 74). We shall have by and by, <lb/>

            and (2) because Aristophanes may well <lb/>

              <graphic url="ENG_BELL_10_fig94.jpg"/></figure> <lb/>
              The change consists merely in the ab­ <lb/>

            Epodes xi. xiii; and Bentley's notes on <lb/>
            the former epode contain an admirable <lb/>
            dissertation on the subject. The MSS. <lb/>
            and early editions, by interpolating a <lb/>
            small particle or other harmless mono­ <lb/>

            filth, on which they find themselves <lb/>
            treading. The <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀλλὰ</foreign> points to this, and at <lb/>
            the same time marls the transition from <lb/>
            their dreams of public self-importance <lb/>
            to the petty needs and discomforts of <lb/>
            their daily life. And there is not the <lb/>

            deserving of serious consideration. It is <lb/>
            from the state of the lamps, and not <lb/>
            from the state of the roads, that the <lb/>

            the condition ofthose streets from day to <lb/>

            A loose stone might cripple one of their <lb/>
            number (supra 247, cf. infra 275); a wet <lb/>
            puddle might cause them discomfort <lb/>
            through the whole sitting of the court. <lb/>
            At present their prospects in this respect <lb/>
            are unusually gloomy. They are already <lb/>
            floundering in the poached filth that <lb/>

            few days. Such genitives as <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἠμερῶν τετ­ <lb/>

            are inferring from the cloggy wicks <lb/>

            these fungi among the signs of rain: <figure type="illustration">

              And Florent Chretien refers to Virgil (Georgics i. 390), whose weather prognostics <lb/>
              are almost entirely borrowed from Aratus : <lb/>

            represented with its mantle full of fmits, <lb/>

            is represented as coming empty-handed, <lb/>
            " because he is," says Sir G. Wheler, <lb/>
            “a barren wind, bringing nothing;” and <lb/>
            although his next neighbour (Kaikias), <lb/>
            the north-east wind, is described by Bp. <lb/>
            Wordsworth as presenting a plateau of <lb/>
            olives, being the production to which <lb/>
            its influence is favourable, yet Sir George <lb/>
            Wheler thinks it is upsetting and de­ <lb/>

            to put in a pot, is said to be derived <lb/>
            from the custom of exposing infants <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐν <lb/>
            χύτραις</foreign>, and hence to mean generally to <lb/>

          <p>200. <foreign xml:lang="grc">̜̜υ̃παγ</foreign>’, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὦπαῖ, ὕπαγε</foreign>.] The song <lb/>
            ended with the word <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐγχυτριεῖς</foreign>, and the <lb/>
            Chorus are ready to proceed on their <lb/>
            journey. On with you, they say to the link­ <lb/>
            boy; we can tarry no longer. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὕπαγ</foreign>’ <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὦ, ὕπαγ</foreign>’ <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὦ</foreign>, is the cry with which, in the Cyclops <lb/>
            of Euripides, 52, the herdsmen urge on <lb/>
            the cows towards the milking-place.</p>
          <p>291—316.] This little dialogue, divided <lb/>
            into a strophe and antistrophe of fourteen <lb/>
            lines each, is introduced for the purpose <lb/>
            of bringing out into stronger relief the <lb/>
            res angusta domi, the narrow and needy <lb/>
            penury of the speaker's domestic life; <lb/>
            and of thus showing, what indeed it was <lb/>
            the main purpose of the Play to show, <lb/>
            that the dicasts gained from their sup­ <lb/>
            port of the demagogues nothing but <lb/>
            empty words, and were left in circum­ <lb/>
            stances of actual destitution, whilst the <lb/>
            demagogues monopolized the real power, <lb/>
            and honour, and wealth, the spoil and <lb/>
            plunder of the Imperial system. See <lb/>
            especially infra 664—685, lines which <lb/>
            constitute the very pith and marrow of <lb/>
            the Play. The prevailing metre of the <lb/>
            present dialogue is the Ionic a minore<lb/>
            <figure type="illustration">

              —<foreign xml:lang="grc">δεῖ καὶ</foreign>, and the corresponding couplet <lb/>
              of the antistrophe (like the first line of <lb/>
              the strophe and antistrophe of the <lb/>
              <foreign xml:lang="grc">μέλος</foreign> which is just completed) may also <lb/>
              be read as anapæstic dimeters, and such <lb/>
              was probably the metre in the passage <lb/>
              of the Theseus parodied below: see on 312 <lb/>

              Pollux, ix. segm. 126. More commonly, <lb/>
              however, they were used as dice, and <lb/>
              were in that character the favourite <lb/>
              amusement of Hellenic boys. In Lucian's <lb/>
              Fourth Dialogue of the Gods, Zeus, seek­ <lb/>
              ing to reconcile Ganymede to the pro­ <lb/>
              spect of a permanent stay in heaven, <lb/>
              answers his natural question, " But who <lb/>
              will play with me in heaven ? I had <lb/>
              plenty of playmates on Ida" (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἤν δὲ <lb/>

              ἐνγὰρ τῃ̂ "Ιδῃ πολλοὶ ικιλἡῶται ἠμεν</foreign>), by <lb/>
              saying, "You shall have Eros to play <lb/>

              μάλα πολλούς</foreign>): as being the most tempt­ <lb/>
              ing idea he could hold out to the boy's <lb/>
              mind. And accordingly Apollonius <lb/>
              Rhodius, in a pretty and well-known <lb/>
              passage (iii. 117), represents Ganymede <lb/>
              and Eros engaged in a game of <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀστάγα­ <lb/>
              λοι</foreign> in heaven.</p>
          <p>299. <foreign xml:lang="grc">μὰ Δί</foreign>’.] The thrice-repeated <foreign xml:lang="grc">μὰ</foreign> <lb/>
            At greatly enhances the simplicity of <lb/>
            the dialogue. In the translation such <lb/>
            a repetition would have appeared con­ <lb/>
            strained, and I have resorted to other <lb/>
            modes of indicating the simplicity of the <lb/>
            original.</p>
          <p>302. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὄψον</foreign>.] In a note to the Pirate, <lb/>
            chap. xi., Sir Walter Scott observes that <lb/>
            " what is eat by way of relish to dry <lb/>
            bread is called kitchen in Scotland, as <lb/>
            cheese, dried fish, or the like relishing <lb/>
            morsels." This is exactly the meaning <lb/>
            of the Greek word <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὄψον</foreign>. In the preced­ <lb/>
            ing line <foreign xml:lang="grc">τρίτον αὐτὸν</foreign>signifies “myself <lb/>

          <p>304. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἅρχων</foreign>.] For, as Pollux observes <lb/>
            (viii. segm. 87), <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἰδία</foreign> (as opposed to <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">κοινῇ</foreign>, the conjoint action of the Board of <lb/>
            Archons) <foreign xml:lang="grc">οἱ θεσμοθέται προγράφουσι πότε <lb/>
            δεῖ δικάζειν τὰ δικαστήρια</foreign>. On the position <lb/>
            which the Archon held in the dicastery, <lb/>
            some remarks will be found in the <lb/>
            Preface.</p>
          <p>308. <foreign xml:lang="grc">πόρον</foreign> ‛<foreign xml:lang="grc">Ελλἅς ἱερόν</foreign>.] The boy <lb/>
            having used the word <foreign xml:lang="grc">πόραν</foreign> (in the <lb/>
            sense of resource, <foreign xml:lang="grc">πόρον τὸν πορισμόν <lb/>
            φησιν</foreign>, Scholiast) goes on humming some <lb/>
            well-known words of Pindar, in which, <lb/>
            however, <foreign xml:lang="grc">πόρον</foreign> means aford, “the sacred <lb/>
            ford of Helle." The words ‛<foreign xml:lang="grc">Ελλὰς ἱερὸν</foreign> <lb/>
            arc added merely to complete the familiar <lb/>
            quotation, and have no connexion with, <lb/>
            but rather make nonsense of, the preced­ <lb/>
            ing sentence. “Positâ primâ voce <foreign xml:lang="grc">πόρον</foreign> <lb/>
            pro <foreign xml:lang="grc">πορισμὸν</foreign>,” says Brunck, “ridiculi <lb/>
            causâ duas insequentes addidit." And <lb/>
            Conz illustrates the passage by an anec­ <lb/>
            dote of a schoolmaster who, stirring up <lb/>
            his boys to do some noble deed, began, <lb/>
            Aude aliquid, aud, without thinking of <lb/>
            what he was saying, added, brevibus <lb/>
            Gyaris et carcere dignum. So, in my <lb/>
            translation, if we suppose the Straits of <lb/>
            Helle to be a popular phrase, we can <lb/>
            understand how the boy, coming to the <lb/>
            word straits, might continue the familiar <lb/>
            words. How absolutely Richter mis­ <lb/>
            understands both the meaning and the <lb/>
            metre of the passage may be judged <lb/>
            from his comment,“‛<foreign xml:lang="grc">Ελλὰς</foreign> dicit, quasi sit <lb/>
            ‛<foreign xml:lang="grc">Ελλάδος</foreign> instar urbs Athenæ”! The pas­ <lb/>
            sage of Pindar to which Aristophanes is <lb/>
            referring is given by the Scholiast, <foreign xml:lang="grc">Παν­ <lb/>

            Boeckh, in whose collection it is Fragm. <lb/>

            occurrence in Euripides, and indeed in <lb/>
            all the Tragedians. The speaker imitates <lb/>
            the wailing of the hapless children who, <lb/>

          <p>BOY. Father, if the Archon say <lb/>
            That the Court won't sit to-day, <lb/>
            Tell me truly, father mine, <lb/>
            Have we wherewithal to dine ? <lb/>
            O my father, should not we <lb/>

              The translation universally adopted of <lb/>
              this line, ut molestias sustineam in alendo <lb/>
              patre, is neither obtainable from the <lb/>
              Greek, nor suitable to the context. Far <lb/>
              better than this is Cobet's suggestion to <lb/>
              transfer the line to the Chorus; a sug­ <lb/>
              gestion which he himself repeatedly <lb/>
              applauds, as being amongst the happiest <lb/>
              of his Aristophanic ventures (Var. Lect. <lb/>
              p. 67; Novæ Lect. Preface vii, pp. 17 and <lb/>
              393). “Raro in Aristophane emendando <lb/>
              mihi videor fuisse fclicior," he says. Yet <lb/>
              in truth Cobet's arrangement would <lb/>
              destroy a piece of genuine Aristophanie <lb/>
              humour, thoroughly in accordance with <lb/>
              the tone and spirit of the Play. <foreign xml:lang="grc">Ηαρέχειν</foreign> <lb/>
              is the strict and proper word to signify <lb/>
              the supplying a person with food; as <lb/>
              infra 722, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐθέλω παρέχειν ὅτι βούλει συι <lb/>
              πίνειν</foreign>, and 736, <foreign xml:lang="grc">παρέχων χόνδρον λείχειν. <lb/>
              Πράγματα</foreign> is of course perpetually used <lb/>
              by Aristophanes in the sense of actions, <lb/>
              lawsuits, as infra 1392,1426. <foreign xml:lang="grc">βόσκειν</foreign> is to <lb/>
              feed, to maintain, as infra 708, 720. Now <lb/>
              the boy has just discovered, to his dis­ <lb/>
              may, that his dinner depends upon the <lb/>
              existence of a lawsuit (cf. infra 674); <lb/>
              and accordingly he breaks into a passion­ <lb/>
              ate lament, " Why didst thou beur me, <lb/>
              Mother, to give me lawsuits for food !” <lb/>
              In the Theseus no doubt the boy had <lb/>
              said, " Why didst thou bear me, Mother, <lb/>
              to give me to the Minotaur for food?" <lb/>
              <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἵνα τῷταύρῳβόσκειν παρέχης</foreign>.</p>

            τυννα</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">δίκτυον</foreign>, the goddess of hunting <lb/>
            would naturally be averse to the destruc­ <lb/>
            tion of hunting-tackle. The name Dic­ <lb/>
            tynna was in some way connected with <lb/>
            Mt. Dicte in Crete, either as having a <lb/>
            common derivation, or as derived the <lb/>
            one from the other. The old legends <lb/>
            referred the appellation to an adventure <lb/>
            of Britomart, who was sometimes none <lb/>
            other than Artemis herself (see Hesy­ <lb/>
            chius s. v. <foreign xml:lang="grc">Βριτόμαρτις</foreign>, which in Cretan <lb/>

            so familiar in Greek mythology, which <lb/>
            was perpetually severing and embodying <lb/>
            into a distinct personality an attribute <lb/>
            or appellation of a divine being. In the <lb/>
            present case the process was probably <lb/>

            Many protested (Diodorus, v. 76) against <lb/>
            the legend on the ground that it was <lb/>
            compatible neither with the dignity of <lb/>
            the goddess, nor with the reputation of <lb/>
            Minos, and contended that the name <lb/>
            Dietynna was bestowed upon her as <lb/>
            the inventor of hunting-nets, <foreign xml:lang="grc">εὑρέτιν <lb/>

          <p>389. <foreign xml:lang="grc">Αύκε</foreign>.] Lycus was in some sense <lb/>
            the patron hero of all the Athenian di­ <lb/>
            casteries; see infra 819. One court-house <lb/>
            was in immediate proximity to his chapel, <lb/>
            and was thence called To <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπὶ Αύκω̩</foreign> (Pol­ <lb/>
            lux, viii. segm. 121). The Scholiast as­ <lb/>
            serts, and several of the old grammarians <lb/>
            support the assertion, that the <foreign xml:lang="grc">κωλακρέ­ <lb/>
            της</foreign>, in paying the dicastic fees, regularly <lb/>
            deposited a triobol in the shrine of Lycus <lb/>
            himself. And Fritzsche, who cites and <lb/>
            discusses all the passages bearing upon <lb/>
            the relation of Lycus to the dicasteries <lb/>
            (De Sortitione Judicum, pp. 34—40), has <lb/>
            no doubt that such was the case. But <lb/>
            to me, I confess, the statement seems <lb/>
            almost incredible, when we consider that <lb/>
            the 'system of paying the dicasts had <lb/>
            itself no existence before the time of <lb/>
            Pericles.</p>

          <p>398. <foreign xml:lang="grc">κατὰ τὴν ἑτέραν</foreign>.] This is usually <lb/>
            understood, in accordance with the Latin <lb/>
            version (which was composed by Bergler <lb/>
            and revised by Brunck), to mean Ascende <lb/>
            ocius in alterum fencstram ; and I <lb/>
            have so translated it. But I do not <lb/>
            suppose that <foreign xml:lang="grc">θυρίδα</foreign> is to be supplied; <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὴν ἑτέραν</foreign> seems used in a more general <lb/>
            sense, 'the other side;' <foreign xml:lang="grc">διὰ του̃ἑτέρου <lb/>

            Compare <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὴν πρώτην, τὴν ταχίστην</foreign>, and <lb/>

          <p>Kuights (729), was an <foreign xml:lang="grc">εἰρεσιώνη</foreign> or <lb/>
            harvest-wreath. Bdelycleon orders the <lb/>
            servant to clamber up on one side of the <lb/>
            door, and as the old man descends by the <lb/>
            other, to seize the <foreign xml:lang="grc">εἰρεσιώνη</foreign>, and beat <lb/>
            him back with it. It would seem, how­ <lb/>
            ever, that on hearing the threat, Philo­ <lb/>
            clean anticipates its execution by drop­ <lb/>
            ping at once to the ground, though only <lb/>
            to find himself in the clutches of his <lb/>
            persecutors, whose attention does not <lb/>
            appear to have been drawn as yet to the <lb/>
            menacing attitude of the Chorus. The <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">εἰρεσιώνη</foreign> was an olive-bough, wreathed <lb/>
            and matted with wool, in which were <lb/>
            stuck divers symbols of the harvest and <lb/>
            vintage, figs, breadcakes, honey, oil, and <lb/>
            wine. The boughs so bedecked were <lb/>
            carried about in the festivals of the <lb/>
            Thargelia and Pyanepsia by boys who <lb/>
            sang <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BELL_10_fig136.jpg"/></figure> <lb/>
              After the festival the boughs were hung <lb/>
              up before the doors, and probably re­ <lb/>
              mained there until the next anniversary. <lb/>
              See Plutarch, Theseus, cap. 22 ; Suidas <lb/>

            Now protruding, now protruding, <lb/>
            Comes the fierce and dreadful sting, <lb/>
            Which we wield for punishing. <lb/>
            Children, hold these garments for us : then away with all your speed, <lb/>
            Shout and run and bawl to Cleon, tell him of this direful deed ; <lb/>

            genuine reading, confirmed by every <lb/>
            MS. The conjectural <foreign xml:lang="grc">βαλόντες</foreign>, which <lb/>
            was first introduced by Brunck, and has <lb/>
            since been retained by every editor <lb/>

            translates <foreign xml:lang="grc">θαἰμάτια λαβόντες</foreign> holding up <lb/>
            your garments), is destitute of authority, <lb/>
            and perverts the sense of the passage. <lb/>
            The Chorus are preparing for the fray, <lb/>
            and they throw their upper mantles to <lb/>
            the linkboys, just as in Thesm. 568 the <lb/>

            her garment to Philista, with the words <lb/>
            AABE <foreign xml:lang="grc">ΘΟΙΜΑΤΙΟΝ, φιλίστη</foreign>, and just as <lb/>

            antistrophe (468—470) the place of <lb/>
            these five lines is occupied by three <lb/>
            common phonic or erotic dimeters: <figure type="illustration">

              It may well be that a line corresponding <lb/>

              respects the error is to be sought In the <lb/>
              passage before us. The last line has <lb/>
              already been reduced into harmony with <lb/>
              the antistrophe by the omission of the <lb/>

            ὄντακἀπολούμενον</foreign> are a mere explanatory <lb/>
            gloss which has crept into the place of <lb/>

              strophe, pæonics and cretics being inter­ <lb/>

              lair, to introduce a resolution.</p>
          <p>416. BA. is <foreign xml:lang="grc">του̃δ</foreign>’.] The entire line is <lb/>
            usually assigned to the Chorus; but <lb/>
            Dobree is, in my judgment, clearly right <lb/>
            in transferring this latter half of it to <lb/>
            Bdelycleon. The words which follow, <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">αυ̑τα δη̑τ</foreign>’<foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐδεινὰ κ.τ.λ</foreign>. are manifestly <lb/>
            an indignant exclamation of the Chorus, <lb/>
            called forth by something which had <lb/>
            immediately preceded. And <foreign xml:lang="grc">μεθήσομαι</foreign> <lb/>
            would be quite out of place on the lips <lb/>
            of the Chorus. Philocleon was in the <lb/>
            hands, not of his fellow-dicasts, but of <lb/>
            Bdelycleon and his servants. And the <lb/>
            appeals to release him are uniformly <lb/>
            addressed not to the Chorus, but by the <lb/>
            Chorus to their opponents. It is the <lb/>
            Chorus who say <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀφίει τὸν ἄνδρα</foreign> (428), <foreign xml:lang="grc">εἰ <lb/>

            the Athenian people, represented, I sup­ <lb/>
            pose, by the audience in the theatre. <lb/>
            They have already sent for aid to Cleon, <lb/>
            the chief <foreign xml:lang="grc">προστάτης</foreign> of the populace, and <lb/>
            they now invoke the assistance of the <lb/>
            subordinate <foreign xml:lang="grc">ποστάται</foreign>, Cleon's minions <lb/>
            and creatures, the hundred <foreign xml:lang="grc">κόλακες</foreign> who <lb/>
            fluttered about him (<foreign xml:lang="grc">εἴ τις προέστηκεν ὑμω̑ν <lb/>
            κόλαξ</foreign>). Of these Theorus seems to have <lb/>
            been one of the most conspicuous, and <lb/>
            the most obnoxious to Aristophanes. <lb/>
            The expression <foreign xml:lang="grc">Θεώρου θοισεχθρία</foreign> is <lb/>
            similar, as Mr. Mitchell observes, to such <lb/>
            phrases as "<foreign xml:lang="grc">Εκτορος βίη</foreign>, and means <lb/>
            merely the " God-detested Theorus." In <lb/>
            Clouds, 400, he is described as <foreign xml:lang="grc">σφόδρ</foreign>’ <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπίορκος</foreign>. See note on 42 supra.</p>
          <p>421. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐν δίκη</foreign>.] Not, as Richter says, <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">δικαίως</foreign>, though that is of course a very <lb/>
            common meaning of the words ; but " on <lb/>
            the field of Jaw " by analogy to <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐνμάχη</foreign>, <lb/>
            “ on the field of battle;" <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀντὶτου̑ δικάζον­ <lb/>
            τες</foreign>, as the Scholiast rightly explains it. <lb/>
            About“ Philip, son of Gorgias ” we have <lb/>
            no certain information. In Birds, 1694— <lb/>
            1705, Aristophanes attributes the cus­ <lb/>
            tom of cutting out the tongue of a <lb/>
            victim (see note on Peace, 1060) to the <lb/>
            disgust inspired by a strange tribe of <lb/>
            barbarians, Gorgiases and Philips, who <lb/>
            gained their livelihood by their tongue. <lb/>
            The Gorgias to whom he refers was in <lb/>
            all probability the celebrated Sophist <lb/>
            (see Süvern, Essay on the Birds, pp. <lb/>
            40, 41, Hamilton's translation), who <lb/>
            being a native of Leontini may possibly <lb/>
            have had, or have been alleged to have, <lb/>
            an intermixture of Sicel blood in his <lb/>
            veins. We have already observed (ou <lb/>
            240 supra) that Aristophanes is sup­ <lb/>
            posed to be alluding in the Parabasis of <lb/>
            the Acharnians to the rhetoric of Gor­ <lb/>
            gias, and I think that he also refers to <lb/>
            him in Thesin. 1103. It may be inferred <lb/>
            from the present passage, coupled with <lb/>
            that in the Birds, that Philip was a <lb/>
            rhetorician, in some way connected with <lb/>
            Gorgias, and that he had lately fallen <lb/>
            under the displeasure of the courts; but <lb/>
            whether he was an actual son, or a <lb/>
            satellite, or (as Bergk apud Meineke, <lb/>
            Fragm. Com. Græe. ii. 992, suggests) <lb/>
            merely a pupil of Gorgias, we have now <lb/>
            no means of ascertaining. <note type="footnote"> K 2 </note></p><pb n="68"/>

            developed infra 1292, where Xanthias, <lb/>

            in terms congratulate tortoises on the <lb/>
            toughness of their shells. These cretic <lb/>

            486, 7) indicate from time to time, in <lb/>

            All three return with line 456 infra.</p>

            Some such word as <foreign xml:lang="grc">δεθη̑ναι</foreign> ought to <lb/>

          <p>Attic hero was appropriately invoked by <lb/>

            According to a legend preserved by <lb/>
            Tzetzes (on Lycophron's Cassandra, 111), <lb/>
            Cecrops, like so many other heroes of <lb/>
            antiquity, sprang from a dragon's teeth ; <lb/>
            and he was popularly represented as a <lb/>
            dragon or serpent from his waist down­ <lb/>
            wards. Hence his epithet <foreign xml:lang="grc">Διφυὴς</foreign>, which <lb/>
            Ovid (ii. Met. 555) translates geminus, <lb/>
            and Justin (ii. 6, 7) biformis. He might <lb/>
            therefore, at all events so far as his <lb/>
            lower extremities, <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὰ πρὸς ποδῶν</foreign>, were <lb/>
            concerned, be justly styled <foreign xml:lang="grc">Δρακοντίδης</foreign>, <lb/>

            Perhaps, as the Scholiast observes, the <lb/>
            saying is a proverbial one; <foreign xml:lang="grc">μήποτε καὶ <lb/>

            Yet now the name of Tyrant was, in <lb/>

          <p>493. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὀρφῶς</foreign>.] This is the Dusky Perch, <lb/>
            or Dusky Serranus, a large fish of good <lb/>
            flavour, weighing ordinarily from ten to <lb/>
            twenty pounds, but occasionally found <lb/>
            of very much greater weight. It is still <lb/>
            called orphos or rophos by the Greeks <lb/>
            (Cuvier and Valenciennes, Hist. Nat. <lb/>
            des Poissons, vi. 4), and is known to <lb/>
            science as the Perca gigas of Brunnich <lb/>
            and Gmelin, the Serranus gigas of Cuvier <lb/>
            and Valenciennes, and the Perca robusta <lb/>
            of Couch. The better-known basse, <lb/>
            which in my translation is substituted <lb/>
            for the orphos, is a very similar fish, <lb/>
            though belonging to a different branch <lb/>
            of the great perch family. Numenius <lb/>
            (apud Ath. vii. 97) characterizes the <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὀρφὸν</foreign> as <foreign xml:lang="grc">περιτρηχέα</foreign>, an epithet clue to <lb/>
            those rough spines which form so <lb/>
            prominent a feature of the Percidæ, and <lb/>
            which have earned for one of our English <lb/>
            river-perch the distinctive appellation of <lb/>
            the Ruffe. The orphos is described by <lb/>
            Aristotle (Hist. Animal., and so Athe­ <lb/>
            naeus ubi supra) as a large carnivorous <lb/>
            (viii. 4. 1) fish of rapid growth (v. 9. 5), <lb/>
            firm of flesh, keeping close to the land <lb/>
            (viii. 15. 1), and fond of getting into <lb/>
            holes (viii. 17, 1). It was found in the <lb/>
            greatest perfection in the Rhodian waters <lb/>
            (Ath. vii. 24). <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀφύαι</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">μεμβράδες</foreign> <lb/>
            (otherwise <foreign xml:lang="grc">βεμβάδες</foreign>) are little fish of <lb/>

            the pilchard, the sprat, the anchovy, <lb/>
            and the sardine are our most familiar <lb/>
            examples. They are frequently men­ <lb/>
            tioned together, as in Alciphron, iii. 53, <lb/>

            popular dish (Knights, 642—682): where­ <lb/>

            poets invariably speak of <foreign xml:lang="grc">μεμβράδες</foreign> we <lb/>
            may safely conclude that they were <lb/>
            reckoned amongst the most worthless <lb/>
            fish in the Athenian market. Timocles, <lb/>
            for example (apud Ath. vi. 39), describes <lb/>
            a needy glutton who roams round the <lb/>
            market contemplating, and asking the <lb/>
            prices of, the most expensive fish, though <lb/>
            after all he can buy nothing better than <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">μεμβράδες</foreign>. And in Alexis (ap. Ath. vii. <lb/>
            28) a parasite vows that he would <lb/>
            actually rather sup off <foreign xml:lang="grc">βεμβράδες</foreign> with <lb/>

            of the culinary art, and means to seethe <lb/>
            a slain animal in its own blood and <lb/>
            steam within a close cauldron. In <lb/>
            Athenæus, ix. cap. 53, one of the guests, <lb/>
            seeing some meat served up richly <lb/>
            steamed and sauced (<foreign xml:lang="grc">συγκεκνισωμένων <lb/>
            τινων κρεῶν ζωμῶ̜</foreign>), says, " Give me some <lb/>
            of that smothered meat (<foreign xml:lang="grc">τῶν πνικτῶν <lb/>
            Κρεαδίων δός</foreign>).” On which Ulpian retorts, <lb/>
            " I shall myself be smothered with <lb/>
            annoyance (<foreign xml:lang="grc">αὐτὸς ἐγὼ ἀποπνιγήσομαι</foreign>) if <lb/>
            you don't tell me where you found meat <lb/>
            so called, for I won't use the name till <lb/>
            I know." Thereupon the guest cites <lb/>
            five passages from the Comedians, and <lb/>
            amongst others the last three words of <lb/>
            the line before us. See also Hdt. ii. 92, <lb/>
            and Nicander of Colophon, apud Ath. <lb/>
            iii. 100. Casaubon (on Athenæus, ii. 70) <lb/>
            says, “ <foreign xml:lang="grc">πνίγειν</foreign> interpreter parare certo <lb/>
            modo veteribus usitato, atque etiam <lb/>
            hodie: quum in proprio succo coquuntur <lb/>

            to have been aware that this was a real <lb/>
            culinary operation, says, <foreign xml:lang="grc">δέον εἰπε</foreign>ȋ<foreign xml:lang="grc">ν</foreign> <figure type="illustration">

          <p>BDEL. Yes, for that's the sort of dainty you, by Zeus, have loved so long. <lb/>
            Yet I think I'll soon convince you that your mode of life is wrong, <lb/>
            If you can but once be silent, and to what I say give heed.</p>
          <p>PHIL. I am wrong to be a dicast! BDEL. Laughed to utter scorn indeed, <lb/>
            Mocked by men you all but worship, for you can't their treachery see, <lb/>
            You're a slave, and yet don't know it. PHIL. Name not slavery to me ! <lb/>
            I am lord of all, I tell you. BDEL. You're the veriest drudge, I vow, <lb/>
            Thinking that you're lord of all. For come, my father, teach us now, <lb/>
            If you reap the fruits of Hellas, what's the benefit to you ?</p>
          <p>PHIL. Willingly. Let these be umpires. BDEL. I'll accept their judgment too. <lb/>
            Now then all at once release him. PHIL. And besides a sword supply,</p>

            the parties is reduced to this issue, Do <lb/>
            the dicasts, or do they not, obtain, any <lb/>
            real substantial benefit from the dicastic <lb/>
            office ? Is that office, as Philocleon <lb/>
            contends, a <foreign xml:lang="grc">μεγάλη ἀρχἡ</foreign>, or is it, indeed, <lb/>
            the slavery which his son pronounces it ? <lb/>
            To show the dicasts that they were in <lb/>
            truth mere <foreign xml:lang="grc">δου̑λοι</foreign>, working for the benefit <lb/>
            of the demagogues, and not for their own <lb/>
            advantage, was (as is more largely <lb/>
            explained in the Preface) the great and <lb/>
            paramount object of the Play.</p>
          <p>521. <foreign xml:lang="grc">τοὐτοισί γ̓ἐπιτρἐψαι</foreign>.] To submit <lb/>
            the question to the arbitrement of the <lb/>
            Chorus. Philocleon, versed in legal <lb/>
            terms and legal practices, at once accepts <lb/>
            the issue proposed, and offers to refer <lb/>
            the matters in difference to Arbitration, <lb/>
            a method of settling disputes which is <lb/>
            recognized in every country, and is <lb/>
            frequently commended by the Athenian <lb/>
            orators. The first sentence in the first <lb/>
            speech of Demosthenes (Demosth. adv. <lb/>
            Aphobum) is, El <foreign xml:lang="grc">μὲν ἠβούλετ' ῎ΑΦοβος, ὦ <lb/>
            ἄνδρες δικασταὶ, τὰδίκαια ποιει̑ν, ἢ περὶ ὦν <lb/>

            ἐκείνων γνωσθει̑σιν</foreign> EMMENEIN (infra 524).</p>
          <p>522. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ΦΙ. καὶ ξίΦος</foreign>.] The determination <lb/>
            to kill himself if defeated is far more <lb/>
            consonant to Philocleon's character and <lb/>
            circumstances than to those of Bdely­ <lb/>
            clean; and in fact the sword will presently <lb/>
            (infra 714) be found in Philocleon's hand. <lb/>
            Philocleon might, indeed, be holding it <lb/>
            out for Bdelycleon to fall upon its point, <lb/>
            but the person to whom the sword is <lb/>
            here given is plainly intended to use it <lb/>
            against himself, and there is no trace of <lb/>
            his having handed it over to his anta­ <lb/>
            gonist. I have, therefore, though with <lb/>
            some hesitation, followed the modern <lb/>
            editors in transferring to Philocleon the <lb/>
            words <foreign xml:lang="grc">καὶ ξίΦος . . . τω̨̑ ξίΦει</foreign>, which were <lb/>
            formerly continued to his son. And see <lb/>

            the note on Peace, 268, is the ejaculation <lb/>
            of a hesitating speaker, forgetting, or <lb/>
            pretending to forget, what he was about <lb/>
            to say. It is used with great propriety <lb/>
            here, since Bdelycleon, wishing to bind <lb/>
            his father in the strictest and most <lb/>
            technical manner, but not being so <lb/>
            familiar as the old dicast with legal <lb/>
            terms and phraseology, is naturally <lb/>
            obliged to hum and haw before he can <lb/>
            bring out the exact formula required. <lb/>
            That <foreign xml:lang="grc">τῇ διαίτῃ ἐμμένειν</foreign>, to abide by the <lb/>
            award, is the correct legal phrase is <lb/>
            abundantly plain from many passages <lb/>
            of the Athenian orators. Mitchell refers <lb/>
            to Demosthenes adv. Bœotum, ii. p. 1011 <lb/>
            (cap. 11), <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀναγκασθεὶς ἐμμει̑ναι̑νι</foreign> Tn <foreign xml:lang="grc">διαίτῃ</foreign>, <lb/>
            and a little later in the same speech, p. <lb/>

            a cup of pure wine unmingled with <lb/>
            water. See the note on Peace, 300. <lb/>
            But the wine-cup conveyed no idea of <lb/>
            pleasure to Philocleon's mind; and for <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">κύλικα</foreign>, therefore, he substitutes <foreign xml:lang="grc">μισθὸν</foreign>, <lb/>

            choral portion of each system consists of <lb/>

            that you may be shown to be, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὅπως <lb/>

            the sentence Bdelycleon strikes in, saying, <lb/>
            "You shall be shown, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ΦΑΝΕΙ</foreign>, in your true <lb/>

            or diverting it by way of retort to <lb/>

            be a speaker of a different stamp to this <lb/>

            the result one sentence, though it is <lb/>
            possible that but for Bdelycleon's inter­ <lb/>

            For first when rising from bed in the morn, to the criminal Court betimes I trudge, <lb/>
            Great six-foot fellows are there at the rails, in anxious haste to salute their Judge. <lb/>
            ADd the delicate hand, which has dipped so deep in the public purse, he claps into mine, <lb/>
            And he bows before me, and makes his prayer, and softens his voice to a pitiful whine : <lb/>
            O pity me, pity me, Sire, he cries, if you ever indulged your longing for pelf, <lb/>
            When you managed the mess on a far campaign, or served some office of state yourself. <lb/>

          <p><foreign xml:lang="grc">Χει̑ρα</foreign>); the only excuse for this piece of <lb/>
            barbarity being the abrupt transition <lb/>
            from the plural to the singular verb, <lb/>
            without the introduction of a new nomi­ <lb/>

            in Aristophanes. Mitchell quotes ex­ <lb/>
            amples from Peace, 639, Eccl. 672, and <lb/>
            Plato : but in truth it is unnecessary to <lb/>
            go beyond this very speech of Philocleon: <lb/>
            its first two sections exhibit one per­ <lb/>
            petual interchange of the plural and <lb/>
            singular numbers, of the class and the <lb/>
            individual who represents the class. <lb/>
            " High personages watch for me, <foreign xml:lang="grc">τηρου̑σι</foreign>, <lb/>

            (553); " he slips, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐμβάλλει</foreign> his hand into <lb/>

            than any argument of Bdelycleon could <lb/>
            have done, the contrast (on which the <lb/>
            whole play hinges) between the public <lb/>
            pretensions of the dicasts, and the <lb/>
            necessitous circumstances of their daily <lb/>

          <p>I hear them utter all sorts of cries designed expressly to win my grace, <lb/>
            What won't they utter, what don't they urge, to coax a Justice who tries their case ? <lb/>
            Some vow they are needy and friendless men, and over their poverty wail and whine, <lb/>
            And reckon up hardships, false with true, till he makes them out to be equal to mine. <lb/>
            Some tell us a legend of days gone by, or a joke from Æsop witty and sage, <lb/>
            Or jest and banter, to make me laugh, that so I may doff my terrible rage. <lb/>
            And if all this fails, and I stand unmoved, he leads by the hand his little ones near, <lb/>
            He brings his girls and he brings his boys; and I, the Judge, am composed to hear. <lb/>
            They huddle together with piteous bleats: while trembling above them he prays to me, <lb/>
            Prays as to a God his accounts to pass, to give him a quittance, and leave him free.</p>
          <p>in which the practice is mentioned by <lb/>
            ancient writers. Thus in the Oration <lb/>
            against Meidias (sees. 186—188) Demos­ <lb/>
            thenes says, "I know that Meidias will <lb/>
            come with tears and supplications, bring­ <lb/>
            ing forward his children, and making <lb/>
            himself out the most miserable of men. <lb/>
            I have no children to bring forward, <lb/>
            but am I therefore to suffer wrong? <lb/>
            Nay but when you see him bringing <lb/>
            forward his children, think that you see <lb/>
            me on the other side, bringing forward <lb/>
            the laws which he has violated, and the <lb/>
            oaths which ye have sworn." "If a <lb/>
            prisoner," says Lysias (pro Polystrato, <lb/>
            161) "bring forward his children with <lb/>
            wailing and weeping, ye pardon the <lb/>
            father for the sake of the children; <lb/>
            children, of whom ye know not yet <lb/>
            whether they will themselves grow up <lb/>
            good. citizens or bad." In the Apology <lb/>
            of Plato, cap. 23, Socrates is represented <lb/>
            as saying to his judges, " It may be <lb/>
            that some amongst you are vexed and <lb/>
            indignant, because I do not, as others <lb/>
            do, bring forward my children in the <lb/>
            court, and seek to win your favour and <lb/>
            move your pity by unmanly and ignoble <lb/>
            supplications." That is a course, he <lb/>
            says, which no Athenian (above all, no <lb/>
            Athenian philosopher) should adopt to <lb/>
            save himself from any penalty which he <lb/>
            may righteously have deserved, though <lb/>
            it be the extreme penalty of death; and <lb/>
            judges too, he adds, should be swayed <lb/>
            not by motives of pity and favour, but <lb/>
            by the truth and justice of the case.</p>

          <p>571. <foreign xml:lang="grc">τη̑ς εὐθύνης</foreign>.] All Athenian officials <lb/>
            at the close of their term of office were <lb/>
            compelled to render an account. These <lb/>
            accounts were first laid before the public <lb/>
            auditors, who invited all persons to come <lb/>
            in and make their objections. If no <lb/>

            If, however, any difficulty arose, the <lb/>
            matter was submitted to the dicasteries, <lb/>
            and with them the ultimate decision <lb/>
            rested. The subject is treated at some <lb/>
            length by Æschines at the commence­ <lb/>
            ment of his speech against Ctesiphon, <lb/>
            who had proposed that Demosthenes, <lb/>
            before he had passed his audit and <lb/>
            obtained his discharge, should receive a <lb/>
            crown of gold for his services. AEschines <lb/>

          <p>578. <foreign xml:lang="grc">δοκιμαζομένων</foreign>.] Every Athenian, <lb/>
            on attaining the age of manhood, had <lb/>
            his name entered in the register, <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸ <lb/>
            ληξιαρχικὸν γραμματει̑ο</foreign>, of his deme, and <lb/>
            was thenceforth entitled to the full <lb/>
            privileges of an Athenian citizen. In <lb/>
            ordinary cases this registration took <lb/>
            place at the age of twenty years : bnt it <lb/>
            seems probable that orphan heirs (such <lb/>
            as Demosthenes: see the speeches <lb/>
            against Aphobus and Onetor) were <lb/>
            allowed to be registered at an earlier <lb/>
            period, if on a personal examination, <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">δοιμαμασία</foreign>, they were able to satisfy the <lb/>
            judges that they had already arrived at <lb/>
            their full physical strength and maturity. <lb/>
            See Schömann, Do Comitiis, pp. 76—79.</p>
          <p>579. <foreign xml:lang="grc">Οἲγρος</foreign>.] Œagrus was a popular <lb/>
            actor of the day. Whether the tragedy <lb/>
            which furnished his favourite character <lb/>
            was the Niobe of Æschylus, or the Niobe <lb/>
            of Sophocles, we have now no means of <lb/>
            deciding. The latter was probably the <lb/>
            more recent Play of the two : but, on <lb/>
            the other hand, Aristophanes frequently <lb/>
            (Birds,1247 ; Frogs, 912—20,1392) refers <lb/>
            to, or quotes from, the Niobe of <lb/>
            Æschylus, and nowhere, unless in the <lb/>
            present passage, makes any allusion to <lb/>
            the Niobe of Sophocles. Richter says <lb/>
            "propter verba <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὴν καλλίστην ἀπολέξας</foreign> <lb/>
            Sophoclem subauditum esse dixerim," <lb/>
            but of course <foreign xml:lang="grc">καλλίστην</foreign> refers not to the <lb/>
            Play, but to the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ρ̒η̑σις</foreign>; nor indeed (were <lb/>
            it otherwise) have we the slightest ground <lb/>
            for supposing that the Niobe of Sophocles <lb/>
            was, in the estimation of Aristophanes, <lb/>
            or in fact, superior to the Niobe of <lb/>
            Æschylus. See Wagner, Trag. Græc <lb/>
            Fragm. vol. i. pp. 73, 335. With the <lb/>

            the pipe. It was intended to make the <lb/>
            breath flow more evenly through the <lb/>
            instrument, and so to produce a sweeter <lb/>

            reason to believe that an Athenian <lb/>
            citizen was legally competent to dispose <lb/>
            by will of the hand and fortune of <lb/>
            his heiress-daughter: and Aristophanes <lb/>
            must, therefore, I imagine, be here refer­ <lb/>
            ring to some recent case in which the <lb/>
            Courts had, on too light grounds, super­ <lb/>
            seded a father's testamentary dispositions, <lb/>
            and awarded the heiress and her property <lb/>
            to some favoured claimant, who probably <lb/>
            came forward as her nearest of lin. <lb/>
            And this will account for the tone of <lb/>
            Bdelycleon's rejoinder, and his use of <lb/>
            the word <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀδικει̑ς</foreign> in reference to the <lb/>

            We bid them begone, and be hanged, and ourselves take charge of the girl and her worthy estate ; <lb/>
            And we give her away to whoever we choose, to whoever may chance to persuade us: yet we, <lb/>
            Whilst other officials must pass an account, alone from control and accounting are free.</p>
          <p>BD. Ay that, and that only, of all you have said, I own is a privilege lucky and rare, <lb/>

            People sitting in their judicial capacity. <lb/>
            To them all officials were responsible: <lb/>
            see the note on 571 supra. And they <lb/>
            themselves were not, and could not be, <lb/>

            if they act in the manner which his <lb/>

            offences, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἂγραΦα ἀδικήματα</foreign>, which had <lb/>
            been overlooked in the written code, and <lb/>
            to which, therefore, no punishment was <lb/>
            by law annexed. In such cases it was <lb/>
            necessary to appeal to the Senate or the <lb/>

            were other cases, too, in which a com­ <lb/>
            plainant was required to apply to the <lb/>
            Assembly for leave to institute proceed­ <lb/>

            the bulky person (see note on 16 supra) <lb/>
            of Cleonymus is again brought forward. <lb/>
            Evathlus, Cleonymus, and Theorus (and <lb/>
            possibly Euphemius also) were all <lb/>
            minor demagogues, the satellites and <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">κόλακες</foreign> of Cleon. And so, like Theorus <lb/>
            in the dream supra 42, Cleonymus is <lb/>
            here (though in another fashion) repre­ <lb/>
            seNted as <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὴν κεφαὴν κόλακος ἔχων</foreign>. <lb/>
            Evathlus, who was probably the well- <lb/>
            known scholar of Protagoras, is described <lb/>
            by Aristophanes in the Holcades as a <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">πονηρὸς συνήγρος</foreign>? and with this the <lb/>
            notice in Acharnians, 710, would seem <lb/>
            to agree. And we may perhaps conclude <lb/>
            from the present passage that Cleonymus <lb/>
            figured in the same character.</p>

            Scholiast, the early editions; and is <lb/>
            positively demanded by the context. <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὑμα̑ς</foreign>, which crept into Kuster's text <lb/>
            apparently by an error of the printer, <lb/>
            and which is retained by all recent <lb/>
            editors, is altogether inconsistent with <lb/>
            the tenor of Philocleon's argument. <lb/>
            "We are recognized," he says, "as the <lb/>
            Sovereign Power in the state: the <lb/>
            Senate and the Assembly send us cases, <lb/>
            which they are unable to determine: <lb/>
            the orators and advocates vow that they <lb/>
            will protect its from wrong: none can <lb/>
            succeed in the Assembly except by our <lb/>
            vote and influence: Cleon himself, the <lb/>
            common assailant of all else, comes <lb/>
            forward as our staunch friend and <lb/>
            patron; whilst his satellites descend to <lb/>
            the lowest and most servile offices to <lb/>
            curry favour with us." Modern editors <lb/>
            seem to imagine that <foreign xml:lang="grc">πλήθους</foreign> in the <lb/>
            second limb of the sentence requires <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὑμα̑ς</foreign> in the first: forgetting that the <lb/>
            Heliasts considered themselves, and in <lb/>
            fact were, the <foreign xml:lang="grc">πλῆθος</foreign>, the <foreign xml:lang="grc">δῆμος</foreign>, the <lb/>
            Athenian People. In the orators the <lb/>
            expression <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸὑμέτερον πλῆθος</foreign> is fre­ <lb/>
            quently applied to the dicastic body, as <lb/>
            in Lysias adv. Agoratum, passim. And <lb/>
            so supra 267. And see the following <lb/>
            note.</p>

          <p>They pass a decree for the culprits to go to the able and popular Courts to be tried: <lb/>
            Evathlus, and He ! the loser of shields, the fawning, the great Cowardonymus say <lb/>
            " They'll always be fighting away for the mob," " the people of Athens they'll never betray." <lb/>
            And none in the People a measure can pass, unless he propose that the Courts shall be free, <lb/>
            Dismissed and discharged for the rest of the day when once we have settled a single decree. <lb/>
            Yea, Cleon the Bawler and Brawler himself, at us, and us only, to nibble forbears, <lb/>
            And sweeps off the flies that annoy us, and still with a vigilant hand for our dignity cares. <lb/>
            You never have shown such attention as this, or displayed such a zeal in your father's affairs. <lb/>
            Yet Theorus, a statesman as noble and grand as lordly Euphemius, runs at our call</p>
          <p>would naturally form so very large a <lb/>
            proportion of the ordinary Athenian <lb/>
            Assembly that their united votes could <lb/>
            determine the fate of any measure <lb/>
            brought forward there. It was this <lb/>
            which makes Aristophanes so anxious, <lb/>
            in the present Play, to detach them from <lb/>
            their alliance with the demagogues: and <lb/>
            it was for the same reason that the <lb/>
            demagogues were so anxious to maintain <lb/>
            and strengthen that alliance. It seems <lb/>
            that one method of earning the gratitude <lb/>
            and securing the votes of the dicasts was <lb/>
            to get them released after one cause was <lb/>
            heard, and to give them a full day's pay <lb/>
            for a short day's service. In a graphic <lb/>
            passage of the Knights (50-60), to which <lb/>
            Bergler refers, this form of bribery is <lb/>
            directly attributed to Cleon. He is there <lb/>
            depicted as a Paphlagoniam slave, who <lb/>
            ingratiates himself with the Demus, his <lb/>
            master, at the expense of his fellow- <lb/>
            servants: and wins the old man's favour <lb/>

              is here represented as sitting in the <lb/>

            by Florent Chretien here, and Jens on <lb/>
            Hesychius (who both take <foreign xml:lang="grc">λουτρὸν</foreign> in the <lb/>

            gets the better of its bath, which defeats <lb/>
            all efforts to cleanse it, may be said to <lb/>
            gain a victory indeed, but a victory <lb/>
            which it were better to lose than to gain. <lb/>
            And Philocleou's triumphs, it is implied, <lb/>
            are triumphs which bring him no benefit <lb/>
            whatever, but turn to his own disadvan­ <lb/>

            with more or less precision to the proverb <lb/>

            when alarmed by a thunderstorm was <lb/>

            called a poppy sma (a name formed to <lb/>

            as an inarticulate deprecation, or charm <lb/>
            to avert the danger. It seems that this <lb/>
            superstitious habit was very prevalent <lb/>
            in the ancient world: "fulgetras," says <lb/>
            Pliny (xxviii. 5, cited by Bergler), <lb/>

            great anxiety, and even Philocleon had <lb/>
            spoken in a faltering tone, as regarded <lb/>
            the probable issue of the contest. The <lb/>

            his case before the Arbitrators, and it is <lb/>
            now Bdelycleon's turn. His argument <lb/>
            consists, not of any criticism upon the <lb/>
            law or upon the practice of the Athenian <lb/>
            dicasteries, but of proof that the power <lb/>
            obtained by the alliance of the dema­ <lb/>
            gogues and the dicasts is wielded <lb/>
            exclusively for the benefit of the dema­ <lb/>
            gogues, and not in any way for the <lb/>
            benefit of the dicasts. The two speeches <lb/>
            may in fact be summed up in a very <lb/>
            few words. "Ours is a <foreign xml:lang="grc">μεγάλη ἀρχὴ</foreign>)," says <lb/>
            Philocleon, " for all men, even the great <lb/>
            demagogues themselves, are ready to <lb/>
            court and to flatter us." " Yours is a <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">μεγάλη δουλεία</foreign>," retorts Bdelycleon, " for <lb/>
            the demagogues retain to themselves every <lb/>
            substantial advantage, and leave you to <lb/>
            penury and starvation."</p>

            cleon had concluded his panegyrical <lb/>
            oration by arrogating to himself the <lb/>
            dignity and the attributes of Zeus. See <lb/>
            the note on 621 supra. Bdelycleon <lb/>
            therefore in opening his reply addresses <lb/>
            him in the language with which Zeus is <lb/>
            addressed by Athene in the Homeric <lb/>
            poems, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὠ̑ πάτερ ἡμέτερε Κρονίδη, ὕπατε <lb/>
            κρειόντων</foreign>, Iliad viii. 31, Odyssey i.45, 81. <lb/>
            But Philocleon interrupts him at once. <lb/>
            " <foreign xml:lang="grc">Μὴ πατέριζε</foreign>," he says, " don't befather <lb/>
            me: that will not avail you: what you <lb/>
            have to do is to prove your case, and <lb/>
            convince me that I am a slave." Bdely­ <lb/>
            clean accordingly drops the heroic style, <lb/>
            and addresses his father as <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὠ̑ παππίδιον</foreign>. <lb/>
            This is better than the Scholiast's <lb/>

          <p>BD. Hard were the task, and shrewd the intent, for a Comedy-poet all too great <lb/>

            Yet, 0 dread Cronides, Father and Lord, PHIL. Stop, stop, don't talk in that father-me way, <lb/>
            Convince me at once that I'm only a slave, or else I protest you shall die this day, <lb/>

            And not with pebbles precisely ranged, but roughly thus on your fingers count <lb/>

            Κρόνιππος, Κρονίων ὄζων</foreign>, is singularly <lb/>
            unfortunate, since it was precisely by <lb/>

            the <foreign xml:lang="grc">νεώτεροι θεοὶ</foreign> that <foreign xml:lang="grc">Κρόνος</foreign> and its <lb/>
            derivatives acquired that signification. <lb/>
            Mitchell follows Conz, but Richter takes <lb/>
            the correct view. <foreign xml:lang="grc">πατέριζε</foreign> is a word <lb/>
            formed by way of response to the pre­ <lb/>
            ceding <foreign xml:lang="grc">πάτερ</foreign>, just as in Thesm. 617 <lb/>

            largely augmented before B.C. 422. Many <lb/>
            causes co-operated to this rapid increase. <lb/>
            Allies who had formerly furnished only <lb/>
            ships and men, had been brought, <lb/>
            willingly or unwillingly, to contribute <lb/>
            money instead: fresh tribute was exacted <lb/>
            from conquered states, such for example <lb/>
            as Cythera, which was required to pay <lb/>
            four talents a year (Thuc. iv. 57); and <lb/>
            even the money payments which Aris­ <lb/>
            tides had assessed appear to have been <lb/>
            subsequently increased. It is said that <lb/>
            the aggregate contributions ultimately <lb/>
            amounted to a sum of 1300 talents, or <lb/>
            upwards of 300,000l. a year (Plutarch, <lb/>

            (De Comitiis, Book ii. chap. 9). I <lb/>

            items of revenue, co-ordinate with those <lb/>
            enumerated in the following line. The <lb/>

            endeavouring to dissuade the Ten Thou­ <lb/>
            sand from provoking the vengeance of <lb/>
            Sparta. " For Athens," he says, " en­ <lb/>
            tered upon the Peloponnesian War with <lb/>
            numerous fleets, and ample treasures, <lb/>
            and a yearly revenue <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀπό τε τω̑ν ἐνδήμων</foreign> <lb/>
            Kat <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐκ τη̑ς ὑπερορίας</foreign> of not less than 1000 <lb/>
            talents: moreover, she was mistress of <lb/>
            all the isles, and possessed many cities <lb/>
            in Asia, and many more in Europe, and <lb/>
            this very Byzantium where now we are : <lb/>
            and yet she was vanquished by the <lb/>
            Spartan confederacy, which was then <lb/>
            less powerful than now." If Xenophon <lb/>
            means to include, in his estimate of 1000 <lb/>
            talents, the tribute from the Allies and <lb/>
            subject cities (a point which does not <lb/>
            seem to me quite certain), we must sup­ <lb/>
            pose either (1) that he is understating <lb/>
            the amount, or (2) that Aristophanes is <lb/>
            overstating it, or (3) that the revenue <lb/>
            had doubled between B.C. 431 and B.C. <lb/>
            422. The first hypothesis may be con­ <lb/>
            sidered out of the question, since Xeno­ <lb/>
            phon would have been on that particular <lb/>
            occasion inclined to exaggerate rather <lb/>
            than to understate the resources of <lb/>
            Athens. Boeckh (iii. 19) is of opinion <lb/>
            that the revenue had in fact very largely <lb/>
            increased before the date of the Wasps. <lb/>
            And see the note on 657 supra. Yet <lb/>
            even so it is extremely probable that <lb/>
            Aristophanes is to some extent over­ <lb/>

            the demagogues and their parasites <lb/>
            (such as Theorus and his fellows), who <lb/>
            contributed nothing to its acquisition.</p>
          <p>685. <foreign xml:lang="grc">πεςομαΧῶν</foreign>.] Observe the allite­ <lb/>
            ration in this verse. It is, however, no <lb/>
            doubt unintentional. The trick so com­ <lb/>
            mon in the Roman dramatists of appeal­ <lb/>
            ing to the ear by the jingle of words, <lb/>
            either commencing with the same letter <lb/>
            (" non potuit paucis plum plane pro­ <lb/>
            loqui," Plautus, Men. ii. 1. 27) or having <lb/>
            similar terminations, belongs to a much <lb/>
            later date, and is quite foreign to the <lb/>
            vigorous thought and energetic rhythm <lb/>
            of Aristophanic comedy.</p>
          <p>686. <foreign xml:lang="grc">εισεθύν</foreign>.] Not, I think, domum <lb/>
            tuam ingressus, as Brunck translates it, <lb/>
            and as it is universally rendered. I take <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">εἰσελθὸν</foreign> to mean “ came forward in the <lb/>
            Assembly," and <foreign xml:lang="grc">εἴπη</foreign>, “ moved a resolu­ <lb/>
            tion," as supra 595, and passim. I <lb/>
            imagine that by some recent order of <lb/>
            the Assembly, the court-doors, <foreign xml:lang="grc">κιγκλίδες</foreign>, <lb/>
            were to be closed so soon as proceedings <lb/>
            commenced, and no dicast to be admitted <lb/>
            afterwards. See infra 775 and 892. And <lb/>
            thus we see the full meaning of <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπιταττό­ <lb/>
            μενος</foreign> in the preceding verse. " You are <lb/>
            not even your own masters,” says Bdely­ <lb/>
            cleon, “ free to attend at what hour you <lb/>
            choose: you are under orders: you must <lb/>
            go before proceedings commence, or lose <lb/>
            even your miserable pittance." Of the <lb/>
            person here described as <foreign xml:lang="grc">Χαιμέον νἰὸς</foreign>, <lb/>
            nothing is known. The Scholiast says,<figure type="illustration">

          <p>a signal, <foreign xml:lang="grc">σημεῖον</foreign>, was hoisted over the <lb/>
            place of meeting. Its exact form is un. <lb/>
            known, but it is generally supposed to <lb/>
            have been a lofty pole or standard of <lb/>
            some sort. See Schömann, De Comitiis, <lb/>
            i. 13. Probably loiterers would delay <lb/>
            their coming until they actually saw the <lb/>
            signal up; and hence the necessity for <lb/>
            some such regulation as that mentioned <lb/>
            in the preceding note, to secure a more <lb/>
            punctual attendance. In Thesmoph. <lb/>
            277 (to which Bergler refers), Mnesilo­ <lb/>

            Brunck refers to Theocritus, vi. 29, <foreign xml:lang="grc">σίξα</foreign> <lb/>
            (so Ruhnken for <foreign xml:lang="grc">σῖγα</foreign>) 8' <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὑλακτεῖν νιν καὶ <lb/>

            her." <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπιρρύξας</foreign> has the like meaning, <lb/>
            as Brunck also observes, citing Hesychius, <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπιρρύζεν κύνας, ἐπαφιέναι</foreign> /<foreign xml:lang="grc">καὶ παρορμᾷν</foreign>. <lb/>
            So also the Scholiast here, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀπὸ τη̑ς</foreign> <figure type="illustration">

              ever, is formed not from the sibilant S, <lb/>
              but from the canina litera R. Our old <lb/>
              writers called it " to tarre a dog on," <lb/>
              whence possibly the name " terrier." <lb/>
              Shakespeare's King John, iv. 1, <lb/>
              [The fire] perchance will sparkle in your eyes, <lb/>
              And like a dog that is compelled to fight, <lb/>
              Snatch at the master that doth tarre him on.</p>
          <p>Bergler refers to Olynth. iii. p. 37, a <lb/>
            passage which bears a very striking <lb/>
            resemblance to this speech of Bdelycleon. <lb/>
            " 'Tis those who transact the affairs of <lb/>
            state," Demosthenes says, " that get the <lb/>
            whole advantage, while yon the Demus <lb/>
            fill but a servant's position, content, <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">άγαπω̑ντες</foreign>, and gratified if they do but <lb/>
            allow yon free entrance to the spectacles <lb/>

              get rid of these miserable doles, which are <lb/>
              like the driblets of food allowed to the <lb/>
              sick, enough to keep them from dying, <lb/>
              but not enough to give them strength."</p>
          <p>707. <foreign xml:lang="grc">Χιλιαι</foreign>.] This is probably not <lb/>
            intended as an exact computation: the <lb/>
            poet is speaking in round numbers, <foreign xml:lang="grc">Τῷ <lb/>
            ὰπηρτισμένῳ ἀριθμῷ ἐΧρήσατο</foreign>, as the <lb/>
            Scholiast says: but nevertheless the <lb/>
            statement is believed to come very near <lb/>
            the mark. See Boeckh, iii. 16. The <lb/>
            20,000 Athenians for whom provision is <lb/>
            thus to be made, are by Colonel Leake <lb/>
            (Attica, App. 21), Boeckh (i. 7), and <lb/>
            others supposed to include the entire <lb/>
            number of Athenian citizens. I cannot <lb/>
            agree in this view, or think it likely that <lb/>
            Aristophanes would comprehend the <lb/>
            wealthy and ruling classes in his gigantic <lb/>
            system of outdoor relief. He himself <lb/>
            in Eccl. 1132 reckons the number of <lb/>
            Athenian citizens as "over 30,000;" <lb/>
            agreeing with Hdt. v. 97, and (appa-</p><pb n="111"/>
            
          <p>They want you to know your keeper's hand ; and then if he hiss you on to fly <lb/>
            At some helpless foe, away you go, with eager vehemence ready and rough. <lb/>
            Since if they wished to maintain you well, the way to do it were plain enough. <lb/>
            A thousand cities our rule obey, a thousand cities their tribute pay, <lb/>
            Allot them twenty Athenians each, to feed and nourish from day to day, - <lb/>
            And twice ten thousand citizens there, are living immersed in dishes of hare, <lb/>
            With creams and beestings and sumptuous fare, and garlands and coronals everywhere, <lb/>
            Enjoying a fate that is worthy the state, and worthy the trophy on Marathon plain.</p>
          <p>rently) with Plato, Symposium, cap. 3; <lb/>
            Axiochus, 369 A. Other writers, it is <lb/>
            true, put the number at 20,000 (Demos­ <lb/>
            thenes contra Aristogit. Or. i. 785; <lb/>
            Plutarch, Lycurg. Orat. vit. 34; Ath. vi. <lb/>
            cap. 103): but these are all referring to <lb/>
            a later period, when the population of <lb/>
            Athens was no longer at its height. <lb/>
            And I cannot doubt that at the date of <lb/>
            the Wasps the number of Athenian <lb/>
            citizens (in the estimation of Aristophanes <lb/>
            at least) considerably exceeded 20,000. <lb/>
            And see the note on 718 infra.</p>
          <p>709. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐν πα̑σι λαγῴοις</foreign>.] We should <lb/>
            certainly have expected <foreign xml:lang="grc">α̑ν</foreign> here, and <lb/>
            Dawes (Misc. Crit. 275) accordingly sub­ <lb/>
            stitutes that particle for <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐν</foreign>. But this <lb/>
            alteration, though supported by some of <lb/>
            the inferior MSS., seems quite inadmis­ <lb/>
            sible. The phrase <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐν πα̑σι λαγῴοις</foreign> <lb/>
            is essentially different from that with <lb/>
            which Dawes compares it, <foreign xml:lang="grc">τῷ ζω̑σι;ΣΙΔ. <lb/>
            Γάλοκτι καὶ τυροῖσι καὶμήλων βορᾳ̑</foreign> (Eurip. <lb/>
            Cyclops, 121). Like <foreign xml:lang="grc">̀́̑̒̓ἐν πα̑σι βολίτος</foreign> in <lb/>
            Ach. 1026, it is a parody on the common <lb/>
            phrase <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐν πα̑σιν ἀγαθοι̑ς</foreign>, and signifies, not <lb/>
            the food by which life is sustained, but <lb/>
            the luxury in the midst of which it is <lb/>
            passed. Dobree's suggestion, to change <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">μυριμ́δες</foreign> into <foreign xml:lang="grc">μυριμ́δ</foreign>’ <foreign xml:lang="grc">α̑ν</foreign>, is less open to <lb/>
            objection: but I am myself inclined to <lb/>
            think that the <foreign xml:lang="grc">α̑ν</foreign> is purposely omitted, <lb/>
            in order to present a more vivid picture, <lb/>
            as of an actual reality, and not a mere <lb/>
            possible contingency. As to <foreign xml:lang="grc">λαγῷα</foreign> and <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">πυὸς</foreign>, see the note on Peace, 1150.</p>
          <p>711. <foreign xml:lang="grc">του̑ Μαραθω̑νι τροπαίου</foreign>.] The <lb/>
            plains of Marathon were covered with <lb/>
            memorials of the great battle (Pausanias, <lb/>
            Attica, 32). There were two mounds or <lb/>
            barrows erected over the dead, one for <lb/>
            the citizens, another for the Platæans <lb/>
            and for the slaves. The barrow over the <lb/>
            Athenian citizens still stands, a con­ <lb/>
            spicuous and solemn object, upon the <lb/>
            solitary plain (Wordsworth's Athens and <lb/>
            Attica, chap. vi.): it is about thirty feet <lb/>

              ing note ( see Wagner on Hippol. Fragm. <lb/>
              19): the words <foreign xml:lang="grc">μὴ μοι τούτωνμηδὲν ὑπ­ <lb/>
              ισχνοῦ</foreign> are clearly of tragic origin ; while <lb/>
              the present line is found not in the <lb/>
              Hippolytus, but in the Alcestis. Valck­ <lb/>
              naer's suggestion that the words <foreign xml:lang="grc">κείνων <lb/>
              ἒραμαι, κεῖθι γενοίμαν</foreign> were the original <lb/>
              form of Hipp. 230, and Porson's that <lb/>
              they have dropped out from between <lb/>
              Hipp. 216 and 217, are alike unnecessary <lb/>

          <p>756. <foreign xml:lang="grc">σπεῦδ᾽, ὦ ψυχή</foreign>.] Philocleon is <lb/>
            carried away by his vivid recollection of <lb/>
            the familiar scene in the dicastery, and <lb/>
            acts it over again in imagination. The <lb/>
            line is apparently a parody of some <lb/>
            passage wherein a Tragic hero is apos­ <lb/>
            trophizing his own soul, and inciting it <lb/>
            to deeds of daring. " Where hast thou <lb/>
            been, my heart? ”—Shakespeare’s Ant. <lb/>
            and Cleo. iii. 11. Compare Acharnians, <lb/>
            483—9. But I take the expression, as <lb/>
            adopted by Philocleon, to be addressed <lb/>
            not to his soul, but to his vote, which he <lb/>
            calls by that endearing appellation, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ξωὴ</foreign> <lb/>
            Kal anima mea. He pictures him­ <lb/>
            self standing over the verdict-box, and <lb/>
            about to deposit his vote. He has pro­ <lb/>
            longed the enjoyment until all the rest <lb/>
            have voted, and he still toys with his <lb/>
            vote, as reluctant to part with it. First <lb/>
            he exhorts it to make haste, as the <foreign xml:lang="grc">κήρυξ</foreign> <lb/>
            is about to close the voting : then he <lb/>
            pretends to lose it, and fumbles for it: <lb/>
            finally he throws it in, with resolute <lb/>
            energy. The words <foreign xml:lang="grc">ποῦ μοι ψυχὴ</foreign> imply <lb/>
            that the action of Philocleon is arrested <lb/>
            by his momentary inability to find the <lb/>
            object required: the epithet <foreign xml:lang="grc">σκιερὰ</foreign>,* as <lb/>
            applied to the vote, means that it is lost <lb/>
            in some obscure place.</p>
          <p>757. <foreign xml:lang="grc">πάρες, ὦ σκιερά</foreign>.] The Scholiast <lb/>
            observes that these words are taken <lb/>
            from the Bellerophon, and they are <lb/>
            plainly part of the anapæstic system <lb/>
            which is spoken by Bellerophon as he <lb/>
            gradually rises from the earth, and <lb/>
            which is parodied at some length in the <lb/>
            Peace. See the note on Peace, 73. The <lb/>
            passage here cited is</p><pb n="119"/>
            
          <p>On, on, my soul! why, where is she gone ? <lb/>
            Hah ! by your leave, my shadowy one ! <lb/>
            Zounds, if I catch when in Court Pin sitting <lb/>
            Cleon again a theft committing!</p>

            Hades shall settle ere my soul comply.</p>
          <p>BDEL. Well but if these are really your delights, <lb/>
            Yet why go There ? why not remain at home <lb/>
            And sit and judge among your household here ?</p>
          <p>PHIL. Folly ! judge what ? BDEL. The same as There you do. <lb/>
            Suppose you catch your housemaid on the sly <lb/>
            Opening the door : fine her for that, one drachma. <lb/>
            That's what you did at every sitting There. <lb/>

          <p>758. <foreign xml:lang="grc">μὴ νῦν</foreign>.] The time for delay is <lb/>
            over, and Philocleon throws in his vote <lb/>
            of condemnation with energy and de­ <lb/>
            cision. He is not yet weaned from his <lb/>
            love of the dicasteries, but he is, at all <lb/>
            events, alienated from Cleon, and avows <lb/>
            his determination to show him no <lb/>
            mercy when next he is brought before <lb/>
            them on a charge of peculation. The <lb/>
            words <foreign xml:lang="grc">μὴ λάβοιμι</foreign> (like our " don't let me <lb/>
            catch ”) imply a menace. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀπειλε</foreign>î <foreign xml:lang="grc">κατα­ <lb/>

            in the present passage the meaning seems <lb/>

            phanes is paving the way for the double <lb/>
            pun which he is about to introduce. In <lb/>
            fine weather, he says, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἡλιάσει πρὸς ἣλιον</foreign>, <lb/>
            in wet weather <foreign xml:lang="grc">εἴσει</foreign>, which is really <lb/>
            from <foreign xml:lang="grc">εἴσομαι</foreign> (Plutus, 647), and is ex­ <lb/>
            plained by the Scholiasts as equivalent <lb/>
            to <foreign xml:lang="grc">δικάσεις, γνώσῃ</foreign>, but upon which Aris­ <lb/>
            tophanes plays as if it were from <foreign xml:lang="grc">εἲσειμι</foreign>, <lb/>

            or connected with, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὰλίξεσθαι</foreign> to assemble, <lb/>

            For once Lysistratus, the funny fool, <lb/>
            Played me the scurviest trick. We'd got one drachma <lb/>
            Betwixt us two: he changed it at the fish-stall;</p>
          <p>piece, to be divided between the two. <lb/>
            It would have been hardly possible for <lb/>
            the Colacretæ to provide every day the <lb/>
            enormous number of obols required for <lb/>
            the daily payment of the dicastic fees: <lb/>
            and it must have been the rule, rather <lb/>
            than the exception, for two or more <lb/>
            dicasts to receive a larger coin, which <lb/>
            they were themselves to change, and <lb/>
            share between them.</p>

            vegetable-market, the flower-market, and <lb/>
            the like, the Athenians preferred to say <lb/>

            their proximity to the public thorough- <lb/>

            during the day, the house was entrusted <lb/>
            to the guardianship of Apollo, whose <lb/>
            obelisk, surrounded by his own favourite <unclear/> <lb/>
            aurel (Thesm. 489), also stood in a pro­ <lb/>
            minent position near the vestibule, <foreign xml:lang="grc">τοὐ <lb/>
            μου̑ προθύρου προπύλαιος</foreign> (infra 875, where <lb/>
            see the note). Yet, after all these pre­ <lb/>
            cautions, it was thought prudent to <lb/>
            propitiate Hermes by placing his sym­ <lb/>
            bol also before the door, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπὶ άποτροπη̨̂ <lb/>

            Plutus, 1153. It is to this third symbol <lb/>
            that Strepsiades appeals in Clouds, 1478. <lb/>
            The insults to which the Hermæ were <lb/>
            subjected on a notable occasion (Thue. <lb/>
            vi. 27), and the grave results which <lb/>
            followed, arc matters of history. To the <lb/>

          <p>813. <foreign xml:lang="grc">κἄν</foreign> yap <foreign xml:lang="grc">πυρέττω</foreign>.] Philocleon, <lb/>
            when ill and feverish, was accustomed to <lb/>
            remain at home and nurse himself, sit­ <lb/>
            ting by the fire, and sipping his gruel, <lb/>
            after the fashion of invalids. Hitherto <lb/>
            this indulgence had entailed the loss of <lb/>
            his three obols : but under the new sys­ <lb/>
            tem it will no longer prevent his per­ <lb/>
            forming his dicastic duties, and earning <lb/>
            his dicastic fee. The Scholiast says, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὡς <lb/>

            line 797 (in neither of which situations <lb/>
            does it make any sense at all), I cannot <lb/>

          <p>PHIL. 0 hero lord, how stern you are to see!</p>

          <p>BDEL. If you got seated sooner, I should sooner</p>
          <p>quite complete, Philocleon would fain <lb/>
            have it too placcd under the protection <lb/>
            of Lycus. He prefers the request in <lb/>
            this coaxing indirect manner, because <lb/>
            he can hardly venture to hope for so <lb/>
            great a privilege. Bdelycleon, however, <lb/>
            is equal to the occasion, and has already <lb/>
            provided not only a little shrine, but also <lb/>
            a representation of Lycus himself. The <lb/>

            sion of admiration on Philocleon's part <lb/>
            at the stern and terrible aspect of his <lb/>
            favourite : whilst in the next line Bdely­ <lb/>

            the opportunity of pointing out the true <lb/>
            feature of resemblance between them, <lb/>
            viz. the absence of the shield. We are <lb/>
            informed by several writers that Lycus <lb/>

            <foreign xml:lang="grc">θεσμοέτης</foreign>, in which character he is <lb/>
            addressed infra 935.</p>
          <p>828. <foreign xml:lang="grc">Θρᾳ̑ττα</foreign>.] This was the commonest <lb/>
            name for a maid-servant at Athens. It <lb/>
            occurs in the Acharnians, the Peace, and <lb/>
            the Thesmophoriazusæ. In the Theæte­ <lb/>
            tus (chap. 24) it is the name of the <lb/>
            smart and natty handmaiden, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐμμελὴς <lb/>
            καὶ χαρίεσσα θεραπαινὶς</foreign>, who rallied Thales <lb/>

            gazing upwards at the stars, had en­ <lb/>
            tirely overlooked the peril which was <lb/>
            lying at his feet. And in truth, ob­ <lb/>
            serves Socrates, a philosopher when he <lb/>
            comes down to the world is an object of <lb/>
            derision, not merely to Thrattas, but to <lb/>
            the general populace as well, <foreign xml:lang="grc">γέλωτα <lb/>

            That careless Thratta now, she charred the pitcher.</p>
          <p>PHIL. 0 stop, for goodness sake ! you've all but killed me. <lb/>
            What! call a suit on with no railing here, <lb/>
            Always the first of all our sacred things ?</p>
          <p>BDEL. No more there is, by Zeus. PHIL. I'll run myself <lb/>
            And forage out whatever comes to hand.</p>
          <p>BDEL. Heyday! where now ? The strange infatuation !</p>
          <p>XANTH. Psha ! rot the dog ! To keep a cur like this !</p>
          <p>BDEL. What's happened now ? XANTH. Why, has not Labes hero <lb/>

            A rich Sicilian cheese, and bolted it ?</p>

          <p>men feel for their old haunts and as­ <lb/>
            sociations. Whilst Philocleon is gone <lb/>
            in quest of a railing, a sudden scuffle <lb/>
            takes place within, and immediately <lb/>
            afterwards the voice of Xanthias is <lb/>
            heard, exclaiming at the dog.</p>

            <foreign xml:lang="grc">Κύων</foreign> in 841, 895, 902, should be written <lb/>
            with a capital K. And as Laches was <lb/>
            accused of embezzling the Sicilian spoil, <lb/>
            so Labes is to be accused of devouring <lb/>

            where Hermes says to Cario (to cite <lb/>

            Run, fetch your master out, <lb/>
            And then his wife and children, then the slaves and dog, <lb/>
            And after them yourself, and after you the hog.</p>
          <p>But we have already seen (see note on <lb/>
            179 supra) that the stables themselves <lb/>
            were within the hall door: and we need <lb/>
            not suppose that the pigs dwelt with <lb/>
            the human inhabitants as they do in <lb/>
            Irish cabins, or as, it is said (Hallam's <lb/>
            Middle Ages, iii. 355, note), oxen for­ <lb/>
            merly did in Cheshire cottages. And see <lb/>
            the description which Xenophon (Anab. <lb/>
            iv. 5) gives of the underground dwellings <lb/>
            in Armenia B.C. 401, a description which <lb/>
            exactly tallies with that given by Mr. Cur­ <lb/>
            zon (Armenia, chap. iii.)A.D. 1838. In the <lb/>
            present passage <foreign xml:lang="grc">Ἑστία</foreign> means Hestia, the <lb/>
            goddess of the hearth, and not, as the <lb/>
            Scholiast takes it, and as I, to preserve <lb/>
            the play of words, have thought it best <lb/>
            to translate it, the actual hearth itself.</p>
          <p>846. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀφ' Ἑστίας ὰρχόμενος</foreign>.] In solemn <lb/>
            festivals, the first libation was poured, <lb/>
            the firstlings of the sacrifice were offered, <lb/>

            And hence the expression <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀφ' Ἑστίας <lb/>
            ἄρχεσθαι</foreign> became a common phrase, <lb/>

            to perform an operation thoroughly, <lb/>
            in regular order, omitting nothing. The <lb/>
            Scholiast refers to Plato, Euthyphron <lb/>

            made in the note on 804. supra. The <lb/>

          <p>departure, the first which he greeted on <lb/>
            his return. Thus in Plantus, Bacch. ii. <lb/>

            coming home after two years' absence, <lb/>

            whilst in Eurip. Phœn. 634 (to which <lb/>
            Bergler refers) Polynices, leaving his <lb/>
            fatherland, takes a last farewell of the <lb/>

              the symbol of Apollo assumed the form <lb/>
              of an obelisk: and it may be worth <lb/>
              observing that in Egypt also an obelisk <lb/>
              represented the worship of the Sun: <lb/>

            trasted with <foreign xml:lang="grc">μέλι</foreign>, and it was therefore <lb/>
            natural to suppose that it was intended <lb/>
            as an emblem of sourness. But <foreign xml:lang="grc">σίριον</foreign> <lb/>
            is in truth new wine, boiled and <lb/>
            sweetened; and is uniformly described by <lb/>

            passages, mentioned by Florent Chretien <lb/>
            and Bergler, I may add the definition <lb/>
            given by Photius, TOV <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἑψημένον οἰνονκαὶ <lb/>
            γλυκύν</foreign>. To get rid of this obvious diffi­ <lb/>
            culty the Scholiast suggests that <foreign xml:lang="grc">σίραιον</foreign>, <lb/>
            when boiled, may have a touch of acidity: <lb/>
            Reiske says, " si mihi de melle Anti­ <lb/>
            cyrano constaret '<foreign xml:lang="grc">Αντικυρίου</foreign> legerem : " <lb/>
            whilst Rudd translates as. if <foreign xml:lang="grc">σίραιον</foreign> <lb/>
            were the offering of Bdelycleon to the <lb/>
            god, in return for which he was to infuse <lb/>
            honcy into the mind of Philocleon. <lb/>
            None of these suggestions is in my <lb/>
            judgment satisfactory : and I think that <lb/>
            a play of words is intended (cf. infra <lb/>
            1082) between <foreign xml:lang="grc">θῡμίδιον</foreign> the diminutive of <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">θυμὸς</foreign>, and <foreign xml:lang="grc">θῠμίδιον</foreign> (or <foreign xml:lang="grc">θύμιον</foreign>) the dimi­ <lb/>
            nutive of <foreign xml:lang="grc">θὐμος</foreign>, the wild herb or vege­ <lb/>
            table which was so much eaten by the <lb/>
            Athenian poor (Plutus, 253), and there­ <lb/>
            fore, no doubt, by the needy dicasts. If, <lb/>
            as is probable enough, this food was <lb/>
            sauced and flavoured with <foreign xml:lang="grc">σίριον</foreign>, the <lb/>
            meaning of the passage becomes clear. <lb/>
            " Mix," prays Bdelycleon, " honey with <lb/>
            his temper, <foreign xml:lang="grc">θῡμίδιον</foreign>, as he is wont to <lb/>
            mix mulled wine with his salad, <foreign xml:lang="grc">θῠμίδιον</foreign>." <lb/>
            It is thus, not as the representative of <lb/>
            sourness, but as the recognized sauce <lb/>
            for <foreign xml:lang="grc">θυμίδιον</foreign>, that <foreign xml:lang="grc">σίραιον</foreign> is contracted <lb/>

            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπά̜δομεν νέαισιν ἀρχαι̑ς</foreign> has the flavour of <lb/>

            Bdelycleon, to be applied by the audience <lb/>

            '<foreign xml:lang="grc">Ιήιε Παιάν</foreign>. But such an invocation, <lb/>
            though a very suitable close to that <lb/>
            solemn address to Apollo, would here be <lb/>
            totally out of place; and it is clearly in <lb/>
            874 a mere ejaculation extra metrum <lb/>

          <p>popular saying; such (it may be) as that <lb/>

            νεῖν γὰρ οὐκἐπίσταμαι</foreign>. Here the speaker <lb/>
            appears to mean that Laches is a blunt <lb/>
            rude soldier, who knows a soldier's duty, <lb/>
            and knows no more. And this is exactly <lb/>
            his character in the Platonic dialogue <lb/>
            which bears his name. He and Nicias <lb/>
            are there consulted about the education <lb/>
            of two boys (Thucydides, son of Melesias <lb/>
            and grandson of the Thucydides men­ <lb/>
            tioned in the note on 944 supra, and <lb/>
            Aristides, son of Lysimaclius and grand­ <lb/>
            son of Aristides the Just), the immediate <lb/>
            question being whether it is advisable <lb/>
            for boys to learn the science of arms <lb/>
            from a professional teacher. Nicias <lb/>
            thinks it is. Laches thinks it is not. <lb/>
            He has seen, he says, that sort of gentry <lb/>
            in actual battle, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐναὐτῷ τῷ ἔργῳ</foreign>, and <lb/>
            remarked the ridiculous figure they cut : <lb/>
            Nicias may be quite right, but such at <lb/>
            all events is his experience. Doctors <lb/>
            differing, the question is referred to <lb/>
            Socrates. Of course Socratcs must needs <lb/>
            go to the root of the matter; the object <lb/>
            of education, the nature of the soul, the <lb/>
            definition of virtue in general, and of <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀνδρία</foreign> in particular. Laches is now in <lb/>
            his element. 0, I know what <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀνδρία</foreign> is, <lb/>
            he says: when a man stands to his post, <lb/>
            and beats off his enemy, that is <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀνδρία</foreign>. <lb/>
            Socrates explains that this is no defini­ <lb/>
            tion at all, but merely an instance, and <lb/>
            not even a well-chosen instance, of <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀνδρία</foreign>: <lb/>
            and by dint of cross-questioning he fairly <lb/>
            puzzles Laches, who says, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀήθης εἰμὶ τῶν</foreign> <figure type="illustration">

            own definition <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπιστήμη τῶν δεινῶν καὶ <lb/>
            θαρραλέων</foreign> is presently demolished by <lb/>
            Socrates, and Nicias himself is obliged <lb/>
            to confess that the true definition has <lb/>
            yet to be found. Laches is delighted to <lb/>
            see that Nicias fares no better than him­ <lb/>
            self. What not got the true definition, <lb/>
            Nicias ? says he; why, when you were <lb/>
            laughing at my answers to Socrates I <lb/>
            made sure you had got the true defini­ <lb/>
            tion yourself. And ultimately he delivers <lb/>
            his opinion thus: I'll tell you what, <lb/>
            Nicias, I advise our friends here not to <lb/>
            consult you and me about the education <lb/>
            of their boys, but to go to Socrates and <lb/>
            to keep fast hold of him. Throughout <lb/>
            the whole dialogue Laches is the plain <lb/>

            There were, as the Scholiast observes, <lb/>
            two Voting Urns: the Nearer, 6 <foreign xml:lang="grc">πρότερος</foreign>, <lb/>
            was the urn of condemnation; the <lb/>
            Further, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὁὕστερος</foreign>, was the urn of ac­ <lb/>
            quittal. Each dicast had one vote, and <lb/>
            only one. If he thought the prisoner <lb/>
            guilty, he dropped it into Urn No. 1; <lb/>
            if not guilty, into Urn No. 2. When all <lb/>
            had voted (supra 752-4) the votes were <lb/>
            cast out, and counted on a stone slab <lb/>
            (supra 332): and the majority was thus <lb/>

            And compare Lysias contra Agoratum, <lb/>
            p. 133. There was, as the Scholiasts <lb/>
            observe, another mode of voting: where <lb/>
            there was but one voting urn, and each <lb/>
            dicast had two votes, a solid onefor <lb/>
            condemnation, and a perforated one for <lb/>
            lacquittal. In this case the dicast <lb/>
            dropped one vote into the voting urn, <lb/>
            and threw aside the unused vote into a <lb/>
            surplus urn. But this is manifestly not <lb/>
            the plan adopted here. See Schömann, <lb/>
            De Judiciorum suffragiis occultis, Opus­ <lb/>
            cula Academica, i. 267. There is here <lb/>
            no trace of two votes : and Bdelycleon <lb/>
            plainly wishes his father to drop an <lb/>
            effective vote of acquittal into the Fur­ <lb/>
            ther Urn, and not merely to throw the <lb/>
            " guilty" vote, as unused, into the <lb/>
            surplus urn, before he has voted at <lb/>
            all.</p>
          <p>988. <foreign xml:lang="grc">μύσας παρᾷξον</foreign>.] The old dicast <lb/>
            is still wavering, and Bdelycleon still <lb/>
            hopes that he may be induced to deposit <lb/>
            his vote in the urn of acquittal. But <lb/>
            knowing how difficult it will be for his <lb/>
            father to pass by the old familiar urn of <lb/>
            condemnation, he begs him to shut his <lb/>
            eyes, and make a dash for it. Philo­ <lb/>
            cleon's repartee <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐ δῆτα κ.τ.λ</foreign>. is treated <lb/>
            as a mere jest ; and the old man does in <lb/>
            truth consent to be led blindfold towards <lb/>
            the urns. Bdelycleon leads him round <lb/>
            (compare the expression <foreign xml:lang="grc">μετὰ χοιρίνης <lb/>
            περιελθεῖν</foreign>, supra 349) so as to miss Urn <lb/>
            No. 1 altogether: and the first urn Philo­ <lb/>
            cleon meets is really Urn No. 2. By the <lb/>
            manoeuvre and ambiguous language of <lb/>
            his son, he is made to suppose that this <lb/>
            is Urn No. 1; and whether he all along <lb/>
            intended to do so, or is at the last <lb/>
            moment unable to resist the temptation, <lb/>
            he puts his vote iuto the ura of acquittal, <lb/>
            believing that he is outwitting his son, <lb/>
            and condemning Labes. <note type="footnote"> U 2 </note></p><pb n="148"/>

            (1009—1014) is a short prelude, intro­ <lb/>
            ductory to the Parabasis proper. The <lb/>
            Para basis proper (1015—1050) consists <lb/>
            of thirty-six Aristophanic lines, con­ <lb/>
            cluding with the Pnigos or Macron <lb/>
            (1051—1059), which is defined by Pollux, <lb/>
            ubi supra, as <foreign xml:lang="grc">βραχὺ μελύδριον ἐπὶ τῇ <lb/>

            is here composed of ten short anapæstic <lb/>
            lines. These sections comprise the <lb/>
            Address of the Poet in his own character <lb/>
            to the audience. The four remaining <lb/>
            sections are concerned with the Chorus <lb/>
            in their dramatic character. The Epir­ <lb/>
            rhema (1071—1090) and Antepirrhema <lb/>
            (1102—1121), each of twenty trochaic <lb/>
            tetrameters, explain the reasons why the <lb/>
            members of the Chorus are represented <lb/>
            under the guise of Wasps. The Epir­ <lb/>
            rhema shows that the wasp is a fit <lb/>
            symbol of their active and martial <lb/>
            youth: the Antepirrhema, that it ac­ <lb/>
            cords equally well with the altered <lb/>
            habits of their dicastic old age. The <lb/>
            battle-scene of the Epirrhema comes <lb/>
            appropriately between the Strophe (1060 <lb/>
            —1070) and Antistrophe (1091—1101), <lb/>
            which are two stirring strains, enume­ <lb/>
            rating the glorious exploits of those <lb/>
            early years.</p>

            per of the Wasps has much in common <lb/>
            with those of the Knights and the <lb/>
            Clouds: and a considerable portion of it <lb/>
            was subsequently repeated in the Para­ <lb/>
            basis of the Peace. The poet reviews <lb/>
            his dramatic career, claiming credit for <lb/>
            the honesty of his purpose, and the <lb/>
            virtue of his Muse,—as well during the <lb/>
            preliminary period when his productions <lb/>
            were fathered on other poets,—as after­ <lb/>
            wards, when with the two great Comedies <lb/>
            already exhibited in his own name, the <lb/>
            Knights and the Clouds, he had gone <lb/>
            out like another Heracles to do battle <lb/>
            with the Monsters which were laying <lb/>
            waste the land; first the giant Dema­ <lb/>
            gogue, powerful and death-dealing as <lb/>
            the fabled Typhoons, and secondly, a foe <lb/>
            more insidious but not less dangerous, <lb/>
            the crafty and cold-blooded school of <lb/>
            Sophists. That in the latter combat he <lb/>
            was ill-supported by the popular voice, <lb/>
            is a proof, he contends, that the people <lb/>
            have not yet fully appreciated either the <lb/>
            deserts of the author, or the singular <lb/>

              other of these two names. It is common­ <lb/>

              brought out in the name of Philouides; <lb/>
              but to my mind the entire tenor of <lb/>
              the Parabasis is absolutely conclusive <lb/>

            again mentioned (as Dindorf observes) <lb/>
            in Plato's Sophista, cap. 37, was one of <lb/>
            those wizards who were called <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐγγαστρί­ <lb/>
            μυθοι</foreign>, ventriloqui, because they made <lb/>
            their voice appear to issue, not from <lb/>
            their organs of speech, but from the <lb/>
            lower parts of their body, as if from an <lb/>
            indwelling spirit there. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐγγαστρίμυθος</foreign> <lb/>
            is the name commonly applied through­ <lb/>
            out the Septuagint, and by the Greek <lb/>
            Fathers, to persons who had familiar <lb/>
            spirits, such as the Witch of Endor. <lb/>
            The art of Eurycles was ventriloquism <lb/>
            in its ancient and etymological significa­ <lb/>
            tion of making your voice proceed from <lb/>
            the depths of your own body, and not <lb/>
            in its modern sense of making your <lb/>
            voice proceed from the lips of others. <lb/>
            Aristophanes poured his ideas through <lb/>
            the lips of Philonides or Callistratus, as <lb/>
            the spirit poured his through the lips of <lb/>
            Eurycles.</p>

            which he himself entered the lists were <lb/>
            all his own genuine unassisted pro­ <lb/>
            ductions ; no other poets exhibited their <lb/>
            comedies under the name of Aristo­ <lb/>
            phanes. In <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἡνιοχήσας</foreign> he is using the <lb/>
            metaphor which is more fully developed</p><pb n="153"/>
            
          <p>Ye have wronged him much, he protests, a bard who had served you often and well before ; <lb/>
            Partly, indeed, himself unseen, assisting others to please you more ; <lb/>
            With the art of a Eurycles, weird and wild, he loved to dive in a stranger's breast, <lb/>
            And pour from thence through a strangers lips full many a sparkling comical jest. <lb/>
            And partly at length in his own true form, as he challenged his fate by himself alone, <lb/>
            And the Muses whose bridled mouths he drave, were never another's, were all his own. <lb/>
            And thus he came to a height of fame which none had ever achieved before, <lb/>
            Yet waxed not high in his own conceit, nor ever an arrogant mind he bore. <lb/>
            He never was found in the exercise-ground, corrupting the boys: he never complied <lb/>
            With the suit of some dissolute knave, who loathed that the vigilant lash of the bard should chide <lb/>
            His vile effeminate boylove. No ! he kept to his purpose pure and high, <lb/>
            That never the Muse, whom he loved to use, the villainous trade of a bawd should ply.</p>
          <p>in 1050 infra. Addison might have <lb/>
            appealed to this passage as a precedent <lb/>
            for part of the imagery employed in his <lb/>
            famous lines, famous for the criticism <lb/>
            of Dr. Johnson in the Lives of the <lb/>
            Poets, <lb/>
            I bridle in my struggling Muse with pain, <lb/>
            That longs to hunch into a nobler strain.</p>
          <p>“To bridle a goddess," says Dr. Johnson, <lb/>
            “is no very delicate idea: but why must <lb/>
            she be bridled ? because she longs to <lb/>
            launch; an act which was never <lb/>
            hindered by a bridle ; and whither will <lb/>
            she launch? Into a nobler strain. She <lb/>
            is in the first line a horse, in the second <lb/>
            a boat, and the care of the poet is to <lb/>
            keep his horse or his boat from singing.”</p>

            His elevation did not result or issue in <lb/>

            ARISTOPHANES. He had not applied be­ <lb/>

            τατον ἔργον ἁπάντων</foreign>, Knights, 516. Now <lb/>

            name, were the Knights, B.C. 424; the <lb/>
            Clouds, B.C. 423; and the Wasps (see <lb/>
            the Preface), B.C. 422. And with this <lb/>
            change in the nominal authorship, there <lb/>
            came a striking change over the spirit <lb/>
            and tone of the Aristophanic drama. <lb/>
            Clean and the demagogues, Euripides <lb/>
            and the Sophists, he had already <lb/>
            satirized, but only in a light and <lb/>
            desultory manner. His earlier comedies <lb/>
            had no trace of the concentrated energy <lb/>
            which he now displayed, wrestling (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ξυσ­ <lb/>

            which were in his judgment threatening <lb/>
            to overpower the pure and wholesome <lb/>
            instincts of the Hellenic mind. The <lb/>
            Knights has been truly described as " a <lb/>
            struggle for life or death ” between the <lb/>
            Poet and the Demagogue. The effect of <lb/>
            the Clouds was as permanent as it was <lb/>
            overwhelming, and years afterwards <lb/>
            exercised a perceptible influence (Plato's <lb/>
            Apology, cap. 3) in bringing about a <lb/>
            catastrophe which the author little in­ <lb/>
            tended, and doubtless deeply regretted.</p>

            Though out of its fierce eyes flashed and flamed the glare of Cynna's detestable light, <lb/>
            And a hundred horrible sycophants' tongues were twining and flickering over its head, <lb/>

            Bergler, Brunck, and Mitchell are al­ <lb/>
            together wrong in translating <foreign xml:lang="grc">καταδωρο­ <lb/>

            one which is certainly not supported <lb/>
            either by verse 675 supra, to which <lb/>
            Bergler refers, for there the proper <lb/>
            reading is <foreign xml:lang="grc">δωροφοροῦσιν</foreign>: nor by Hdt. vi. <lb/>

            in Hdt. vi. 82, <foreign xml:lang="grc">δωροδοκεῖν</foreign> obviously means <lb/>
            not dona dare, but dona accipere. See <lb/>

            Without leaving Cleon (see the Epirrhema <lb/>
            of the Clouds), he attacked a second <lb/>
            foe: he had both on his hands at once. <lb/>
            Bentley's suggestion <foreign xml:lang="grc">μετ᾽ αὐτὰν</foreign>, post illum, <lb/>
            is founded on a misconception of the <lb/>
            poet's position. He had not done with <lb/>
            Cleon when he wrote the Clouds: he <lb/>
            has not even yet done with him, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἔτι καὶ <lb/>
            νυνὶ πολεμεῖ</foreign>. And few will, I think, <lb/>

            Yeterum Comicorum, Quæst. Aristoph. <lb/>

            taken the year after the Knights, and <lb/>
            the year before the Wasps (<foreign xml:lang="grc">πέρυσιν</foreign>), viz. <lb/>
            his encounter with the Sophists in the <lb/>
            comedy of the CLOUDS. And in his own <lb/>
            estimation, if the Knights was the most <lb/>
            gallant, the Clouds was the loftiest and <lb/>
            most brilliant of all his dramatic perform­ <lb/>
            ances, Clouds, 522; infra 1046. Here <lb/>
            he is dealing no longer with a towering <lb/>
            earth-born Giant, but with a more <lb/>
            ghastly Portent, with subtle and invisible <lb/>
            agencies, attacking and enslaving the <lb/>
            minds of men. He likens them to in­ <lb/>
            sidious and unhealthy influences, to <lb/>
            Fevers and Agues, which cramp the <lb/>
            nerves and sap the wholesome energies <lb/>

            But He, when the monstrous form he saw, no bribe he took and no fear he felt, <lb/>
            For you he fought, and for you he fights : and then last year with adventurous hand <lb/>
            He grappled besides with the Spectral Shapes, the Agues and Fevers that plagued our land; <lb/>
            That loved in the darksome hours of night to throttle fathers, and grandsires choke,</p>
          <p>ings which are premonitory symptoms <lb/>
            of fever. See Seiler on Alciphron, iii. 72 ; <lb/>
            Ruhnken's Timæus sub voc. '<foreign xml:lang="grc">Ηπίαλος</foreign>, <lb/>

              <foreign xml:lang="grc">δρομος</foreign>." The line is not found in either <lb/>
              Play as now extant, and is probably <lb/>
              taken from the second Thesmophoriazusæ. <lb/>
              There is perhaps also an allusion here, <lb/>
              as Didymus, cited by the Scholiast, sug­ <lb/>
              gests, to the spectre '<foreign xml:lang="grc">Ηπιάλης</foreign>, the Night­ <lb/>
              mare fiend, with whom long afterwards <lb/>
              in medieval legend Saint Withold <lb/>
              waged successful war (King Lear, in. 4). <lb/>
              Fritzsche (De Socrate Veterum Comi­ <lb/>
              corum ubi supra) and Bergk (on the <lb/>
              Holcades, in Meineke, Fragm. Coin. ii. <lb/>
              1113) both imagine that Aristophanes <lb/>
              must here be recalling and reproducing <lb/>
              the identical language of the earlier <lb/>
              Play. The former therefore argues that <lb/>
              the first edition of the Clouds must have <lb/>
              been widely different from that which <lb/>
              we now possess; whilst Bergk contends <lb/>
              that Aristophanes cannot be alluding to <lb/>
              the Clouds at all, but is speaking of <lb/>
              some lost comedy, possibly the Holcades. <lb/>
              Both these theories betray a complete <lb/>
              misapprehension of the poct's design in <lb/>
              the passage before us. He is giving, as <lb/>
              it were, an allegorical representation of <lb/>
              the combats he has waged, and the deeds <lb/>
              he has done, as Heracles the Destroyer <lb/>
              of Monsters. And he depicts his an­ <lb/>
              tagonists, not in language borrowed from <lb/>
              his former Plays (which would have been <lb/>
              quite inappropriate), but with entirely <lb/>
              new imagery, specially adapted to his <lb/>
              present purpose. Cleon is no longer the <lb/>
              "Paphlagonian slave" of the Knights; <lb/>
              he is now a powerful and angry demon, <lb/>
              a Monster whom it requires no less <lb/>
              than the might of a Heracles to subdue. <lb/>
              The Sophists are no longer the pallid <lb/>
              disputants of the Clouds : they are now <lb/>
              malevolent Plagues and Pestilences, from <lb/>
              whom it is a task not unworthy of a <lb/>
              Heracles to purge and deliver the land. <lb/>
              On <foreign xml:lang="grc">πέρυσιν</foreign> the Scholiast says, <foreign xml:lang="grc">πέρυσι τὰς</foreign> <figure type="illustration">

          <p>1039. <foreign xml:lang="grc">πατέρας ἦγχον</foreign>.] The Scholiast <lb/>
            refers to Clouds, 911; Bergler to Clouds, <lb/>
            1376; and Mitchell to Birds, 13-18,1352, <lb/>
            and Eccl. 638—640. To these references <lb/>
            may be added Clouds, 1385, 1389. We <lb/>
            shall perhaps best follow the train of <lb/>
            thought which was passing through the <lb/>
            mind of Aristophanes by comparing <lb/>
            Clouds, 1428, with Birds, 1348—52. <lb/>
            In the former passage, the young Logi­ <lb/>
            cian, fresh from the school of the <lb/>
            Sophists, argues that the old-fashioned <lb/>
            notions of filial duty will not stand the <lb/>
            test of free inquiry: that gamecocks and <lb/>
            the like fight with their parents; and <lb/>

            bed-scene in the Clouds where Strepsiades <lb/>
            is made to lie down upon the Socratic <lb/>
            pallet, in order to put himself in the <lb/>

            name is in strictness confined to the <lb/>
            Defendant's affidavit, is manifestly er­ <lb/>
            roneous. It is found much more <lb/>
            frequently applied to the Plaintiff's, <lb/>
            which was of course the more important <lb/>
            of the two, as enunciating the charge <lb/>
            which the Defendant merely traversed. <lb/>
            Hence it is commonly used, simpliciter, <lb/>

              old and inveterate assailants, comic <lb/>

              past have been misrepresenting his prin­ <lb/>

            Scholiast refers it to his special jurisdic­ <lb/>

            most thought and labour, he declares <lb/>
            with great emphasis in Clouds, 522. <lb/>
            More especially does he insist on the <lb/>
            fact that in it he was introducing a <lb/>
            novel style of comedy, an entirely origi­ <lb/>

          <p>1071. The Epirrhema contains a de­ <lb/>
            scription of the battle of Marathon, a <lb/>
            scene which was always present to the <lb/>
            mind of Aristophanes, as exemplifying <lb/>
            the generous self-devotion, the I'an­ <lb/>
            hellenic heroism, of Athens in days gone <lb/>
            by. Nor is the description unworthy of <lb/>
            the theme. Even AEschylus, the soldier­ <lb/>
            poet, as M. Villemain truly observes in <lb/>
            his Essai sur la poésie lyrique, has left <lb/>
            us no nobler reminiscence of the Persian <lb/>
            wars than the battle scene before us, a <lb/>
            strain instinct with the spirit and fire <lb/>
            of Tyrtæus. It is probable that the <lb/>
            History of Herodotus had just been <lb/>
            given to the public; and Aristophanes <lb/>
            has caught not only the tone, but the <lb/>
            very phraseology, in which the story of <lb/>
            the two Persian invasions is told iu that <lb/>
            great prose epic. The dicasts are. through­ <lb/>

            them actually present at the battle of <lb/>
            Marathon, sixty-eight years before the <lb/>
            date of the Wasps, Aristophanes (as is <lb/>
            frequently elsewhere his practice) is <lb/>
            treating his Chorus as types rather than <lb/>
            as individuals, and attributing to them <lb/>
            actions in which they could personally <lb/>
            have taken no part. "Soletenim comicus," <lb/>
            as Bergler remarks at Lys. 665, " choro <lb/>
            senum tribuere qum longe antecesserunt <lb/>

            The generals are in consultation about <lb/>
            stealing a march, and occupying by <lb/>
            stealth the side of a mountain pass, and <lb/>
            Xenophon is explaining how he thinks <lb/>
            it can best be done, when he suddenly <lb/>

            First, if any rash assailant dare provoke us, can there be <lb/>
            Any creature more vindictive, more irascible than we ? <lb/>
            Then we manage all our business in a waspish sort of way, <lb/>

            without being caught and beaten." <lb/>
            "Ay, ay," replies Cheirisophus, " but <lb/>

            as they have now become, there is yet <lb/>
            much in their dicastic life and habits to <lb/>

            their way along the streets of Athens <lb/>
            in the direction of their several places of <lb/>
            business. Four snch places are specified <lb/>
            here: (1) Where the Archon is, supra <lb/>
            304. Unless this refers exclusively to <lb/>
            the Archon Eponymus (which is hardly <lb/>
            probable), it would seem to comprehend <lb/>
            all the ten ordinary dicasteries ; each of <lb/>
            which had for its president one of the <lb/>
            Nine Archons, or their official secretary. <lb/>
            The remaining localities appear to be­ <lb/>
            long to special tribunals, summoned for <lb/>
            special purposes. (2) To the Eleven. <lb/>
            These officers were at the head of the <lb/>
            police arrangements at Athens. To <lb/>
            them, as to our sheriffs, belonged the <lb/>
            custody and execution of condemned <lb/>
            criminals. (Plato's Apology, cap. 27. <lb/>
            Phædo, cap. 65, etc.) And- cases of <lb/>
            theft, highway robbery, kidnapping, and <lb/>
            the like were under their peculiar juris­ <lb/>

            Andocide, cap. viii. (apud Reiske's Ora­ <lb/>

            to a Theseum near the Long Walls; but <lb/>
            we have in fact no materials for deciding <lb/>

            at the extremity of the city; for the <lb/>

            the view propounded by the Scholiast, <lb/>
            and adopted by every commentator, that <lb/>

            dicasts : see infra 1121. The comparison <lb/>

            the Play is now concluded: and what <lb/>

            persuade his father to discard the mean <lb/>
            unfashionable <foreign xml:lang="grc">τρίβων</foreign>, the garb of austerity <lb/>
            or poverty, and to assume in exchange <lb/>
            a flowing and luxurious robe of Persian <lb/>

            all entreaties <foreign xml:lang="grc">μὴ φορει̑ν τριβώνιον</foreign> (supra <lb/>

            Pan-Hellenic games, and on other solemn <lb/>
            occasions. Here the more immediate <lb/>
            allusion is to the <foreign xml:lang="grc">θεωίαι</foreign> sent from time <lb/>
            to time to Olympia. See infra 1382, <lb/>
            1387. These missions were composed <lb/>
            of the wealthiest, noblest, and most <lb/>
            respected citizens, who strained every <lb/>
            nerve to make an appearance creditable <lb/>
            both to themselves and to the state, in <lb/>
            the presence of assembled Hellas. See <lb/>
            the account of the <foreign xml:lang="grc">θεωρίαι</foreign> conducted by <lb/>

            and by Alcibiades to Olympia (Thuc. vi. <lb/>
            16). It is therefore merely by way of <lb/>
            irony, or <foreign xml:lang="grc">παρὰ προσδοκίαν</foreign>, that for the <lb/>
            other members of the <foreign xml:lang="grc">θεωρία</foreign> Aristophanes <lb/>

            most constant butts for his degraded <lb/>
            effeminacy: the latter (according to the <lb/>
            Scholiast) satirized by the comedians as <lb/>

          <p>to guess at its meaning. Three deriva­ <lb/>
            tions have been suggested: (1) <foreign xml:lang="grc">κρέξ</foreign>. <lb/>
            The Scholiast says, <foreign xml:lang="grc">κρὲξ, ὄρνεον παραπλή­ <lb/>
            σιον γεράνῳ</foreign>, and Dindorf supposes <foreign xml:lang="grc">κρεκά­ <lb/>
            δια</foreign> to mean " ornamenti genus quoddam <lb/>
            avi illi simile." (2) <foreign xml:lang="grc">κρέκειν</foreign> in the sense <lb/>
            of striking out a sharp sound. Bergler <lb/>
            translates it crepitacula, Voss tintina­ <lb/>
            bula, others instrumenta musica and the <lb/>
            like. (3) <foreign xml:lang="grc">κρἐκειν</foreign> in the sense of weaving. <lb/>
            Cf. <foreign xml:lang="grc">κρόκης χόλιξ</foreign> supra 1144. Brunck <lb/>
            understands it " de aulæis sen velis, <lb/>
            quibus aula tarn ornatûs gratiâ, quam <lb/>
            arcendo vento, pulveri, aut si quid aliud <lb/>
            nocere poterat, obtendebatur." And this <lb/>
            is the simplest, most probable, and most <lb/>
            generally accepted interpretation.</p>
          <p>1216 <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὕδωρ κατὰ χειρός</foreign>.] Bdelycleon <lb/>
            is going in pantomime through the cere­ <lb/>
            monies of a dinner party. A very simi­ <lb/>
            lar, but much lengthier, description is <lb/>
            quoted by Athenæus (xv. 1) from the <lb/>
            Laconians of Plato Comicus. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὕδωρ κατὰ <lb/>
            χειρὸς</foreign> was the ordinary Attic expression <lb/>
            for the wash before meals, as <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀπονίψασθαι</foreign> <lb/>
            for the wash after meals. Aristophanes <lb/>
            the grammarian, says Athenæus ix. 76, <lb/>
            is very severe upon those who are igno­ <lb/>
            rant of this distinction, <foreign xml:lang="grc">παρὰ γὰρ τυῖς</foreign> <figure type="illustration">

          <p>1218. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐνύπνιον</foreign>.] Philocleon fears that <lb/>
            the banquet on which he has been rec­ <lb/>
            koning is to be a mere make-believe <lb/>
            feast, like that of the Barmecides in the <lb/>
            Arabian Nights, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐνύπνιον</foreign>, in a dream; cf. <lb/>
            Plato, Theætetus, cap. 43, (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ὄναρ ἐπλουτή­ <lb/>
            σαμεν</foreign>.The tables are now removed, the <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">δεῖπνον</foreign> is over, and the <foreign xml:lang="grc">συμπόσιον</foreign> begins. <lb/>
            Cf. supra 1005. At these drinking <lb/>
            parties, <foreign xml:lang="grc">αὐλητρίδες</foreign> were invariably pre­ <lb/>
            sent; and they are constantly so de­ <lb/>
            picted in ancient vase paintings. See <lb/>
            Becker's Charicles, Excursus on Sym­ <lb/>
            posia. We shall have an example of this <lb/>
            custom farther on: infra 1368.</p>
          <p>1219. <foreign xml:lang="grc">οἱ συμπόται</foreign>.] There are four <lb/>
            couches; Cleon aud Theorus on one; <lb/>
            the unnamed guest and Acestor on a <lb/>
            second: whilst Æschines, Phanus, and <lb/>
            the two speakers occupy the others. Of <lb/>
            Clean and his faithful Theorus, and of <lb/>
            Æschines 'the son of Sellus; we have <lb/>
            already heard in the earlier scenes of the <lb/>
            Play. Phanus is mentioned, as Bergler <lb/>
            observes, in Knights, 1256 ; but here he <lb/>
            is a mere lay figure to whom no further</p><pb n="187"/>

            Could you with these cap verses properly ?</p>
          <p>PHIL. Could I ? Ay, truly; no Diacrian better.</p>
          <p>allusion is made. The words <foreign xml:lang="grc">ξένος τις <lb/>
            ἕτερος</foreign> are perhaps intended to convey an <lb/>
            imputation upon Acestor as being him­ <lb/>
            self of foreign extraction. Bergler refers <lb/>
            to Birds, 31, <foreign xml:lang="grc">νόσον νοσοῦμεν τὴν ἐναντίαν</foreign> <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BELL_10_fig312.jpg"/></figure></p>
          <p>1222. <foreign xml:lang="grc">σκόλια</foreign>.] We now come to a <lb/>
            little scene which possesses considerable <lb/>
            interest as illustrating the principle on <lb/>
            which scolia were sung at an Athenian <lb/>
            symposium; a subject on which much <lb/>
            light has been thrown by Colonel Mure, <lb/>
            Greek Literature, Book iii. 2. 13. The <lb/>
            singer who led off took in his hand a <lb/>
            lyre, a sprig of myrtle or of laurel, or <lb/>
            other badge of minstrelsy, sang his <lb/>
            scolium, and then passed on the badge <lb/>
            to any guest he might choose. The guest <lb/>
            so selected had to cap the first scolium, <lb/>
            that is to say, he had to sing a second <lb/>
            scolium which he could link on to the <lb/>
            first by some catchword, similarity of <lb/>
            thought, aptness of repartee, or the like. <lb/>
            Then he handed on the badge to a third, <lb/>
            who in like manner was bound to produce <lb/>
            a scolium which would fit on to the <lb/>
            second: and so on, so that ultimately <lb/>
            the whole series of scolia was strung to­ <lb/>
            gether on some principle of continuity. <lb/>
            Hence <foreign xml:lang="grc">σκόλιον δέχεσθαι</foreign> means to cap a <lb/>
            scolium, to carry it on by fitting it with <lb/>
            an appropriate sequel. The nature of <lb/>
            the entertainment is well illustrated by <lb/>
            Colonel Mure from the various scolia <lb/>
            preserved by Athenæus, xv. 50. In such <lb/>
            a scene as the present, the connecting <lb/>
            links would for obvious reasons be less <lb/>
            complete: but even here they are not <lb/>
            altogether imperceptible. In the first <lb/>
            pair of scolia the exact adaptation to <lb/>
            Cleon of the repartee <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐχ οὖτω</foreign> ye <foreign xml:lang="grc">πανοῦρ­ <lb/>
            γος ὡς σὺ κλέπτης</foreign> dispenses with the <lb/>
            necessity of any further link ; but in the <lb/>
            second couple <foreign xml:lang="grc">φίλον</foreign> takes up the catch­ <lb/>
            word <foreign xml:lang="grc">λει</foreign>,and in the third <foreign xml:lang="grc">κἀγὼ</foreign> follows <lb/>
            upon <foreign xml:lang="grc">κἀμοί</foreign>.</p>
          <p>1223. <foreign xml:lang="grc">Διακρίων</foreign>.] If this reading is <lb/>
            correct, the meaning must bo that <lb/>
            Philocleon was a noted scolium-singer <lb/>
            among the Diacrians or Highlanders, <lb/>
            the poorer of the three parties into which <lb/>
            Attica was divided in the days of Solon <lb/>
            and Peisistratus : the others being the <lb/>
            Pedieis or wealthy Lowlanders, and the <lb/>
            Parali or Coastinen. The Scholiast, <note type="footnote"> a b 2 </note> <pb n="188"/>

          <p>both here and on Lysist. 58, says that <lb/>
            Pandion, in distributing Attica amongst <lb/>
            his three sons, gave <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὴν χώραν τὴν Διακρίαν</foreign> <lb/>
            to Lycus, the hero of the law-courts ; see <lb/>
            supra 389, 819. And Fritzsche (De <lb/>
            Sortitione Judicum, p. 35) considers that <lb/>
            it is for this reason that Philocleon <lb/>
            ranges himself amongst the Diacrians.</p>
          <p>1225. '<foreign xml:lang="grc">Αρμοδίου</foreign>.] So. <foreign xml:lang="grc">μέλος</foreign> or <foreign xml:lang="grc">σκύλιον</foreign>. <lb/>
            Aristophanes frequently alludes to this <lb/>
            famous scolium, "the sword in myrtles <lb/>
            drest;" see Acharnians, 980, 1093 ; Lysist. <lb/>
            632, and the fragment of the Pelargi <lb/>
            cited by the Scholiast on 1239 infra (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ὁ <lb/>
            μὲν ᾖδεν 'Αδμήτου λόγον πρὸς μυρρίνην, ὸ</foreign> 8' <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">αὐτὸν ἠνάγκαζεν 'Αρμοδίου μέλος</foreign>). Four <lb/>
            stanzas belonging to it are given by <lb/>
            Athenæus in his great collection of scolia <lb/>
            (xv. 50): <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BELL_10_fig314.jpg"/></figure> <lb/>
              See Tlgen's Scolia, p. 47; Kidd's Dawes, <lb/>
              p. 664; Fritzsche de Pelargis (Quæst. <lb/>
              Aristoph.),p. 50; Colonel Mure, ubi supra. <lb/>
              It is observable that the line sung by <lb/>
              Cleon, <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐδεὶς πώοτ' ἀνὴρ ἔγεντ' 'Αθήναις</foreign>, <lb/>
              which is undoubtedly a genuine quota­ <lb/>
              tion from the scolium, is not found in <lb/>
              the stanzas preserved by Athenæus; <lb/>
              but it is plain that the scolium was not <lb/>
              one consecutive poem, bnt a loose collec­ <lb/>
              tion of stanzas, any one of which might <lb/>
              be taken or omitted at pleasure; like</p><pb n="189"/>
              
          <p>BDEL. I'll put you to the proof. Suppose I'm Cleon. <lb/>
            I'll start the catch Harmodius. You're to cap it. <lb/>
            (Singing) “ Truly Athens never knew "</p>
          <p>PHIL. (Singing) “ Such a rascally thief as you.”</p>
          <p>BDEL. Will you do that ? You'll perish in your noise. <lb/>
            He'll swear he'll fell you, quell you, and expel yon</p>
          <p>Vivien's rhyme in the Idylls of the King, <lb/>
            which " lived dispersedly in many hands, <lb/>
            And every minstrel sang it differently." <lb/>
            Even the four stanzas given by Athenians <lb/>
            are clearly not intended to be sung con­ <lb/>
            secutively; they are in reality separate <lb/>
            scolia on the same subject, and are so <lb/>
            treated by Ilgen, Kidd, and Mure, ubi <lb/>
            supra. The metrical system <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BELL_10_fig315.jpg"/></figure> <lb/>
              is one in which scolia were very fre­ <lb/>
              quently composed. No less than seven <lb/>
              of the scolia collected by Athenæus (in <lb/>
              addition to the four stanzas of Harmo­ <lb/>
              dius) are in this identical metre; and <lb/>
              one of them, as Tyrwhitt observed, is <lb/>
              imitated by Aristophanes in Eeclesia­ <lb/>
              zusæ, 938—945. It was in order to <lb/>
              bring the lines in the text into their real <lb/>
              metre that Bentley in the first line <lb/>
              changed <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὲγένετ</foreign>’ <foreign xml:lang="grc">Αθηνα</foreign>ȋ<foreign xml:lang="grc">ος</foreign> into <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἒγετ</foreign>’ ’<foreign xml:lang="grc">Αθή­ <lb/>
              ναις</foreign>, and in the second inserted the words <lb/>
              <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὡς ϭύ</foreign>.Fritzsche (de l'elargis, p. 51) <lb/>
              thinks that in the actual scolium the <lb/>
              second line may probably have run <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐχ <lb/>
              οὕτωγτπόλει καλὸςπολίτης</foreign>,but I doubt <lb/>
              if we can safely found any inference of <lb/>
              the kind on the blunt repartee of Philo­ <lb/>
              eleon : and the Scholiast says, <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐδὲν</foreign> </p><figure type="illustration">

          <p>6<foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐδείς</foreign>.] Clean, surrounded by <lb/>
            his friends and flatterers, leads off with <lb/>
            a scolium which he expects to be turned <lb/>
            into a graceful compliment to himself.</p>
          <p>1228. <foreign xml:lang="grc">βοώμενος</foreign>.] The old dicast, in <lb/>
            lifting up his voice to give a specimen <lb/>
            of his musical powers, has produced a <lb/>
            series of harsh and discordant sounds, <lb/>
            which his son describes as “ bellowing " <lb/>
            rather than singing, and which, however <lb/>
            suitable to a meeting of Diacrians, would <lb/>
            hardly befit the fashionable company <lb/>
            into which Bdelycleon is proposing to <lb/>
            introduce him. Such, in my opinion, is <lb/>
            the true explanation of <foreign xml:lang="grc">βοώμενος</foreign>. But <lb/>
            many commentators, thinking the term <lb/>
            more applicable to the <foreign xml:lang="grc">μιαρὰφωνὴ</foreign> of <lb/>
            Cleon (see the note on 36 supra), have <lb/>
            had recourse to divers expedients to <lb/>
            make it apply to him. Some put a <lb/>
            colon after <foreign xml:lang="grc">παραπολε</foreign>ȋand connect <foreign xml:lang="grc">βοώ­ <lb/>
            μενος</foreign> with the succeeding line; whilst <lb/>
            Fritzsche and Enger (at Thesm. 995) <lb/>
            suppose <foreign xml:lang="grc">βοώμενος</foreign> to be used in a passivo <lb/>
            sense, and to mean “you will be roared <lb/>
            down." In my judgment neither of <lb/>
            these suggestions is admissible. And <lb/>
            the vehement invective of Cleon is suf­ <lb/>
            ficiently indicated by the reiterated <lb/>
            menaces of the next two lines.</p><pb n="190"/>

            that these lines are borrowed from <lb/>
            Alcæus, where, however, the first word <lb/>

            the more complimentary <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὧνερ</foreign>. See also <lb/>
            the Scholiast on Thesm. 162. The lines <lb/>
            are Æolic pentameters, which commence <lb/>

              is in this metre. As applied to Cleon, <lb/>
              the lines, I suppose, must mean that <lb/>
              Athens is already reeling from the blow <lb/>
              which was dealt her at Delium, and that <lb/>
              Cleon's ambition in aspiring to the great <lb/>
              and important command of the expedi­ <lb/>
              tion despatched to recover Amphipolis <lb/>
              (see the note on 62 supra) might, as in <lb/>

            while still retaining his foppish appear­ <lb/>
            ance, was reduced to actual penury. For­ <lb/>
            merly he had lived an epicure among epi­ <lb/>
            cures;now he must put up with such <lb/>
            meagre and insufficient fare as an apple <lb/>
            and pomegranate: formerly he was rich <lb/>

            of the Cities. At a later period we hear <lb/>
            of political intrigues carried on with the <lb/>
            Penestæ, who were the villein race of <lb/>

            of Laconia. But in the present pas­ <lb/>

            merely for the sake of the joke, and for <lb/>

            He who of his native wit, with rare originality, <lb/>
            Hit upon an undiscovered trick of bestiality : <lb/>

            (if the verses relating to Automenes and <lb/>
            his sons can properly be styled an Epir­ <lb/>
            rhema at all) consisted of nine lines, <lb/>
            eight pæonic lines, and one trochaic <lb/>
            tetrameter : the so-called Antepirrhema <lb/>
            consists of eight lines only, seven pæonic <lb/>
            and one trochaic tetrameter. One <lb/>
            pæonic line is therefore missing. Nor is <lb/>
            this all. The Scholiast suggests, and <lb/>
            the suggestion has met with general <lb/>
            acceptance, that no fewer than eleven <lb/>
            lines (comprising the entire Antistrophe <lb/>

          <p>would seem that in the days of the old <lb/>
            Greek grammarians, the MSS. marked <lb/>
            a lacuna here. Bergk (in Meineke's <lb/>
            Fragm. Corn. ii. 938) conjectures that <lb/>
            the lost Antistrophe contained an attack <lb/>
            upon Cleon, and so was introductory to, <lb/>
            and softened the abruptness of, the <lb/>
            Antepirrhema: but this would hardly <lb/>
            be in accordance with the usual charac­ <lb/>
            ter of these systems.</p>
          <p>1285. <foreign xml:lang="grc">Κλέων</foreign>.] The general nature of <lb/>
            the incident to which these lines refer is <lb/>
            plain enough. Some attack had been <lb/>
            made by Cleon upon Aristophanes, who, <lb/>
            finding that he did not receive from the <lb/>
            people the support which he had ex­ <lb/>
            pected, deemed it necessary to wriggle <lb/>
            out of the scrape, in a somewhat undig­ <lb/>
            nified manner, by patching up a hollow <lb/>
            truce with his powerful and dangerous <lb/>
            opponent. Beyond this we are quite in <lb/>
            the dark :we know nothing ofthe details of <lb/>
            the transaction, nor even at what period <lb/>
            or under what circumstances it occurred; <lb/>
            and the Scholiasts admit themselves to <lb/>
            be equally destitute of all information <lb/>
            on the subject. One of Fritzsche’s <lb/>
            Aristophanic tracts, He injuriis Aria­ <lb/>
            tophuni a Cleone illatis commentatio <lb/>
            (Quæst. Aristoph. i. 301), is devoted to <lb/>
            the task of proving that Aristophanes is <lb/>
            here speaking of his old trouble with <lb/>
            Cleon some four years previously, ante­ <lb/>
            rior to the date of the Acharnians. I do <lb/>
            not see that he at all makes out his case; <lb/>
            and it is, I believe, the almost universal <lb/>
            opinion that the poet is referring to <lb/>
            some fresh onslaught made upon him by <lb/>
            Cleon after, and in consequence of, the <lb/>
            performance of the Knights. And <lb/>
            although this view is equally incapable <lb/>
            of proof, it seems to me on the whole <lb/>
            more likely to be correct.</p>

            both in this word and in <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἔκνισε</foreign>, there is <lb/>
            a special reference intended to the tan­ <lb/>

            apply to Cleon, qui vociferatione et cla­ <lb/>

            generally, and I think more reasonably, <lb/>

            a recent German editor (Richter) should <lb/>

            of the Knights, from Cleon to Socrates, <lb/>
            but in the wiles and trickcries with <lb/>
            which, at the time of the dispute, he <lb/>

            in the hour of need. But who is here <lb/>
            the Vine-pole, and who the Vine ? Ac­ <lb/>
            cording to the common interpretation of <lb/>
            the passage, Cleon is the Vine; he had <lb/>
            relied upon the feigned submission of <lb/>
            Aristophanes, which was but a broken <lb/>
            reed. But to me it seems more probable <lb/>
            that Aristophanes means to represent <lb/>
            himself as the Vine, deceived by the <lb/>
            faithless Vine-pole, that is, by the Athe­ <lb/>
            nian people. The popular sympathy, to <lb/>
            which he had trusted for support against <lb/>
            the machinations of Cleon, had played <lb/>
            him false when the actual danger came. <lb/>
            He is alluding not, as Dindorf seems to <lb/>
            think, to the defeat of the Clouds, but to <lb/>
            the careless indifference, or rather the <lb/>
            undisguised amusement, with which the <lb/>

            Soon as he'd gorged his fill of the good cheer, <lb/>
            He skipped, he leapt, and laughed, and frisked, and whinnied, <lb/>

              <lb/>
              is based on an insufficient consideration <lb/>
              of the passage before us. We have <lb/>
              already met with Lysistratus and his <lb/>
              jests, supra 787. That he was as desti­ <lb/>
              tute of means as of character is intimated <lb/>
              in Acharnians, 855; Knights, 1266 ; and <lb/>
              infra 1312. Phrynichus cannot be iden­ <lb/>
              tified with any known personage of that <lb/>
              name: and Hippyllus and Theophrastus <lb/>
              do not seem to be mentioned elsewhere. <lb/>
              It was not to “ scurvy companions" <lb/>

            notes on lines 189 and 1408. Both <lb/>
            similes imply that Philocleon was (as <lb/>
            we say) above himself, carried away by <lb/>
            his excitement into all manner of ex­ <lb/>
            cesses.</p>
          <p>1311. <foreign xml:lang="grc">πάρνοπι</foreign>.] Philocleon's counter- <lb/>
            similes are aimed at the shabby and <lb/>
            threadbare appearance of the hungry <lb/>
            jester. In the first, three incongruous <lb/>
            images appear to be blended together: <lb/>
            (1) a locust (no inapt representative of a <lb/>
            parasite), a pest common throughout <lb/>
            Hellas, and which though smaller than <lb/>
            the Eastern locust was almost equally <lb/>
            destructive (Dodwell's Tour, i. 215); (2) <lb/>
            a fig-tree, shedding its leaves; and (3) <lb/>
            the worn and tattered remnant of a <lb/>
            scanty cloak. Sthenelus, the object of <lb/>
            comparison in the second simile, was a <lb/>
            tragic actor, who had recently been com­ <lb/>
            pelled by his poverty to sell the very <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">σκευὴν τραγικὴν</foreign> by which he earned his <lb/>
            livelihood.</p>
          <p>1315. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὡς δὴ δεξιός</foreign>.] The phraseology <lb/>
            implies a sarcasm on the affectation of <lb/>
            Theophrastus in seeking to pass himself <lb/>
            off as “a superior person." Nothing is <lb/>
            known of him save from this passage; <lb/>
            but it is evident that Aristophanes is <lb/>
            giving his own opinion of the guests, <lb/>
            through the lips of Philocleon. The <lb/>
            Scholiast explains <foreign xml:lang="grc">διεμύλλαινεν</foreign> to mean <figure type="illustration">

          <p>But lie shrieked back, And you, you're like a locust <lb/>
            That has just shed the lappets of its cloak, <lb/>
            Or Sthenehis, shorn of his goods and chattels. <lb/>
            At this all clapped, save Theophrast; but he <lb/>
            Made a wry face, being forsooth a wit. <lb/>
            And pray, the old man asked him, what makes YOU <lb/>
            Give yourself airs, and think yourself so grand, <lb/>
            You grinning flatterer of the well-to-do? <lb/>
            Thus he kept bantering every guest in turn, <lb/>
            Making rude jokes, and telling idle tales, <lb/>
            In clownish fashion, relevant to nothing. <lb/>
            At last, well drunk, homeward lie turns once more, <lb/>
            Aiming a blow at every one he meets. <lb/>

          <p>1326. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἄνεχε, πάρεχε</foreign>.] Philocleon comes <lb/>
            in, tipsy and mischievous, with a torch <lb/>
            in his hand (<foreign xml:lang="grc">τῃ̑ δα̣δ</foreign>ì, 1331, 1390), or, it <lb/>
            may be, a torch in each hand (<foreign xml:lang="grc">μετὰ λαμ­ <lb/>

            composed wholly or partially of the <lb/>

            find whose <foreign xml:lang="grc">αὐλητρίδα</foreign>, Dardanis, he has <lb/>
            stolen away. As he enters, he utters <lb/>
            certain short ejaculations of dubious <lb/>
            import, which seem to have been the <lb/>
            customary cries at the torch races of the <lb/>
            Gerameicus: see the Scholiast on Enrip. <lb/>
            Troades, 308. In the Troades, ubi supra, <lb/>
            Euripides introduces Cassandra with a <lb/>
            torch in her hand, uttering similar <lb/>
            ejaculations. And the Scholiast here <lb/>
            remarks that everybody considered the <lb/>
            entrance of Philocleon in the Wasps to <lb/>
            be a parody on the entrance of Cassan­ <lb/>
            dra in the Troades; but that in reality <lb/>
            the Troades was not exhibited until <lb/>
            seven years after the Wasps; that is, <lb/>
            iu B.C. 415. And this is no doubt true: <lb/>
            see Clinton's Fasti Hellenici on that <lb/>
            year, and Ælian’s Var. Hist. ii. 8, there <lb/>
            cited. Both poets seem to have adopted. <lb/>

            Gerameicus. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἄνεχε</foreign>, Trapeze may be ad­ <lb/>

            or to the torch, in the sense of “shiue <lb/>

            in which case <foreign xml:lang="grc">πάρεχε</foreign> may mean “make <lb/>

            are commonly given to Bdelycleon, which <lb/>
            is absurd, for Bdelycleon manifestly <lb/>
            makes his first appearance at line 1360 <lb/>
            infra; and litigation is the last thing <lb/>
            with which he would have threatened <lb/>
            his father. See infra 1392, 1418, and <lb/>
            passim. Beer therefore transfers the <lb/>
            speech to the Chorus, which is worse; <lb/>
            for the Chorus are animated with the <lb/>
            most friendly feelings towards Philo­ <lb/>
            cleon, who had indeed done them no <lb/>
            wrong. Dobree truly says that the lines <lb/>
            must belong to one <foreign xml:lang="grc">τῶν ἐπακολουθούντων</foreign>. <lb/>
            But no one seems even to have observed <lb/>
            that the two great Aristophanic manu­ <lb/>

            a term, which a short while ago he <lb/>
            regarded as a title of honour and dig­ <lb/>
            nity, but which, in his altered mood, is <lb/>
            expressive of nothing but contempt and <lb/>
            disgust. The crowd now retire, and <lb/>
            Philocleon (with the <foreign xml:lang="grc">αὐλητρ</foreign>ì<foreign xml:lang="grc">ς</foreign>) is left in <lb/>
            possession of the field.</p>
          <p>1341. The next five and thirty lines con­ <lb/>
            tain much that had been better omitted : <lb/>
            and the English on the right-hand page <lb/>
            is in many places necessarily a substitu­ <lb/>
            tion for, rather than a translation of, <lb/>
            the original text. These drunken scenes, <lb/>
            and indeed the entire two hundred lines <lb/>
            from 1250 to 1449, were, in my opinion, <lb/>
            a mere afterthought on the part of the <lb/>
            poet, introduced when the defeat of the <lb/>
            Clouds had taught him that he could <lb/>
            not with impunity discard the broad <lb/>
            farce, the coarse buffoonery, of other <lb/>
            comedians. The dancing scene at the <lb/>
            close of the Play was manifestly intended <lb/>
            (when it was written) to exhibit the first <lb/>
            outburst of Philocleon after drinking <lb/>
            " the long untasted wine." We have <lb/>
            now two outbursts under precisely <lb/>
            similar circumstances, and quite incon­ <lb/>
            sistent with each other. I imagine that <lb/>
            according to the original scheme of the <lb/>
            Play, Philocleon re-entered the house <lb/>
            soon after he had learned to dress and <lb/>
            behave with propriety; that the Chorus <lb/>
            in the little song <foreign xml:lang="grc">ζηλῶ γε τη̑ς εὐτυχίας</foreign> <lb/>
            at once give vent to their hopes for the <lb/>
            success of the experiment; that then for <lb/>

            producing on his old master; and that <lb/>
            Philocleon forthwith follows with those <lb/>
            imitations of Phrynichus for which we <lb/>
            have been in some measure prepared by <lb/>
            the observations of his fellow-dicasts, <lb/>

            mitted that this enlargement has given <lb/>
            us some capital scenes between Philocleon <lb/>
            and his victims, and some very interest­ <lb/>

            See now, how cleverly I filched you off, <lb/>

            You owe me, child, some gratitude for that. <lb/>

            And when my son is dead, I'll ransom you, <lb/>

            I'm not yet master of my own affairs. <lb/>

            Bdelycleon himself, supra 1192, as to <lb/>

            as, in England, is enjoyed by the fish­ <lb/>
            women of Billingsgate. In the Frogs <lb/>

              It is not right that mighty poets should <lb/>

            Up with his fist, and knock the youngster down. <lb/>
            So mind your eye, or you'll be pummelled too.</p>
          <p>BDEL. Troth, you have learned Olympia to some purpose.</p>
          <p>BAKING GIRL. Oh, there he is ! Oh, pray stand by me now ! <lb/>
            There's the old rascal who misused me so, <lb/>
            Banged with his torch, and toppled down from here <lb/>
            Bread worth ten obols, and four loaves to boot.</p>
          <p>BDEL. There now, you see; troubles and suits once more <lb/>
            Your wine will bring us. PHIL. Troubles ? Not at all. <lb/>
            A merry tale or two sets these things right. <lb/>
            I'll soon set matters right with this young woman.</p>
          <p>1391. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπιθήκην</foreign>.] If the reading of this <lb/>

            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπιθήκη</foreign>, are correct, the words must refer <lb/>
            to some custom of the trade with which <lb/>
            we are now unacquainted. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἄρτους δέκ' <lb/>
            ὀβολω̑ν</foreign>can mean nothing else than " ten <lb/>
            obols' worth of bread;" like the two <lb/>
            hundred penny worth of bread, <foreign xml:lang="grc">διακοσίων <lb/>
            δηναρίων ἄρτοι</foreign>, of the Gospels (St. Mark, <lb/>
            vi. 37; St. John, vi. 7). It cannot mean, <lb/>
            as commonly translated, " decem panes <lb/>
            singulos unius assis." Ten obols' worth <lb/>
            of loaves seems to have constituted a <lb/>
            complete packet, to be delivered at some <lb/>
            single destination; but in addition to <lb/>
            these, the baking-girl was carrying four <lb/>
            extra loaves, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἔξωθεν</foreign> TOV <foreign xml:lang="grc">φορτίουὄντας</foreign>, as <lb/>
            the Scholiast says. The word <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπιθήκη</foreign> is <lb/>
            taken to mean something thrown in, <lb/>
            over and above the ordinary burden. <lb/>
            And such, I may observe, is exactly the <lb/>
            sense in which it is employed by Plautus <lb/>
            (Trinummus iv. 3. 18, probably from Phi­ <lb/>
            lemon; Id. Prologue 19), "Nisi etiam <lb/>
            laborem ad damnum apponam epithecam <lb/>
            insuper," " lose my goods and my labour <lb/>
            to boot." However, I do not feel sure <lb/>
            that <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπιθήκη</foreign> may not (by analogy to <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">θήκη, ἀποθήκη</foreign>, and the like) mean the tray <lb/>
            whereon the loaves were carried; in <lb/>
            which case we might either read <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἄρτους <lb/>
            δέκ'ὀβολω̑ν κατ' ἐπιθήκην τεττάρων</foreign>, " ten <lb/>
            loaves worth four obols which I had <lb/>
            upon my tray," or retaining <foreign xml:lang="grc">κἀπιθήκην</foreign> <lb/>
            (with <foreign xml:lang="grc">τεττάρων</foreign>) translate " loaves worth <lb/>
            ten obols and a tray worth four."</p>

            Doing such damage to the goods of Myrtia, <lb/>
            Sostrata's daughter, and Anchylion's, sir !</p>
          <p>PHIL. Listen, good woman : I am going to tell you <lb/>
            A pleasant tale. BAKING GIRL. Not me, by Zeus, sir, no !</p>
          <p>PHIL. At Æsop, as he walked one eye from supper, <lb/>
            There yapped an impudent and drunken bitch. <lb/>
            Then Æsop answered, 0 VOlt bitch ! you bitch ! <lb/>
            If in the stead of that ungodly tongue <lb/>
            You'd buy some wheat, methinks you'd have more sense.</p>
          <p>BAKING GIRL. Insult me too ? I summon you before <lb/>
            The Market Court for damage done my goods,</p>
          <p>She heaped abuse on every one slie saw, <lb/>
            And therefore rightly was she called a bitch.</p>
          <p>In the present passage the application <lb/>
            of the tale, which had doubtless been <lb/>
            enforced throughout by Philocleon's <lb/>
            tone and gesture, is finally clinched by <lb/>
            the expression <foreign xml:lang="grc">πυροὺς πρίαιο</foreign>, an expres­ <lb/>
            sion which is appropriate not to the dog, <lb/>
            but to a baking-girl who has lost her <lb/>
            loaves. <foreign xml:lang="grc">πυροὺς</foreign>, says the Scholiast, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὥστε <lb/>

            dition to the damage you have caused <lb/>
            me. Do you add insult to injury ?— <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">προσκαλου̑μαι κ.τ.λ</foreign>. Myrtia has got hold <lb/>
            of the correct legal formula. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὁ γὰρ διδοὺς <lb/>

            refers to the <foreign xml:lang="grc">κλητὴρ</foreign>, through whom the <lb/>
            process was to be served; see note on <lb/>
            1408 infra. The words <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὅστις εἶ</foreign> are used <lb/>
            because Myrtia did not know Philocleon's <lb/>

            ing in the Athenian Courts.</p>
          <p>1407. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀγορανόμους</foreign>.] Just as to Eng­ <lb/>
            lish markets there is incident a court <lb/>
            which possesses a summary jurisdiction <lb/>
            to keep order, and punish petty offences <lb/>
            committed in the market: so the <foreign xml:lang="grc">άγοραὶ</foreign> <lb/>
            of Athens and Piratis were under the <lb/>
            jurisdiction of <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀγορανόμοι</foreign> who exercised <lb/>
            a similar authority. I u the Acharnians, <lb/>

          <p>1408. <foreign xml:lang="grc">κλητη̑ρα</foreign>.] Upon this officer de­ <lb/>
            volved the duty of seeing that the defend­ <lb/>
            ant was duly served with the citation to <lb/>
            appear in court and answer the plaintiff's <lb/>
            claim. The summons was served either <lb/>
            by the <foreign xml:lang="grc">κλητὴρ</foreign>himself or in his presence. <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">κλητη̑ρες οἱ ἄνδρες, δι' ών εἰς τὰςδίκας προσ­ <lb/>

            elsewhere. In England this duty was at <lb/>
            one time performed by certain special <lb/>
            officers called Summoners or Sompnours. <lb/>
            A Sompnour is one of the Pilgrims in <lb/>
            Chaucer's Canterbury Tales, and is un­ <lb/>
            mercifully reviled by the Friar for his <lb/>
            odious and unpopular office. The Friar <lb/>
            volunteers to tell a tale about a Somp­ <lb/>
            nour. <lb/>
            But if it like unto this compagnie, <lb/>
            I wol you of a Sompnour tell a game : <lb/>
            Parde, ye may wel knowen by the name, <lb/>
            That of a Sompnour may no good be said (6860.3).</p>
          <p>Accordingly he tells a tale of a Somp­ <lb/>
            nour who plundered the innocent by pre­ <lb/>
            tending to have citations against them, <lb/>
            and then exacting bribes to arrange the <lb/>
            matter. <lb/>
            Withouten mandement, a lewed man <lb/>
            He coude sompne up peine (sub pœnâ) of Cristes curse, <lb/>
            And they were inly glad to fill his purse; .... <lb/>
            He was (if I sbal yeven him his laud) <lb/>
            A theef, and eke a sompnour, and a baud (6928-30, 6935-6). <lb/>
            Riding out one day under a forest side, he meets the devil, who questions him as to <lb/>
            his office. <lb/>
            A, art tbou than a bailiff? Ye, quod be. <lb/>
            He dorste not for veray filth and shame <lb/>
            Say that he was a sompnour for the name (6974-6). <lb/>
            After some joint adventures the devil carries him off.</p><pb n="215"/>

          <p>PHIL. Nay, nay, but listen if I speak not fair. <lb/>
            Simonides and Lasus once were rivals. <lb/>
            Then Lasus says, PisA, I don't care, says he.</p>
          <p>BAKING GIRL. You will, sir, will you ? PHIL. And you, Chærephon, <lb/>

            peting with, rival choruses. Lasus of <lb/>
            Hermione was a contemporary and rival <lb/>
            of the great Simonides of Ceos, who was <lb/>
            famous for the number of victories ob­ <lb/>
            tained by his dithyrambic choruses : <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἔξ <lb/>

            Bentley's Phalaris, Dissert. xi. Of these <lb/>
            two eminent dithyrambists an admirable <lb/>
            account is given in Müller's Literature <lb/>
            of Greece, chapter xiv.</p>
          <p>1411. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὀλίγονμοιΤ</foreign>he speech <lb/>
            of Lasus is emphasized in such a manner <lb/>
            as to make it the reply of Philocleon <lb/>
            himself to his female adversary, and to <lb/>
            show his insolent contempt for her <lb/>
            threats. It is adopted by Bdelycleon, <lb/>
            infra 1446. And cf. Clouds, 1142 ; Frogs, <lb/>
            1136. No doubt the affected indifference <lb/>
            of Lasus to the prize was owing to the <lb/>
            consciousness that he had but slight <lb/>
            chance of obtaining it, with the ever­ <lb/>
            victorious Simonides for his antagonist.</p>

            and the ordinary punctuation of the <lb/>
            passage. The comparison of Chærephon <lb/>
            with <foreign xml:lang="grc">θαψίνη</foreign> Ino is of a piece with the <lb/>
            epithet <foreign xml:lang="grc">πύξινον</foreign> which Eupolis in the <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">Πόλεις</foreign> bestowed on the same cadaverous <lb/>
            student. Schol. on Plato's Apology. <lb/>
            And see Schol. on 1408 supra. The <lb/>
            Thapsus or Thapsia (for though some­ <lb/>
            what different qualities arc ascribed to <lb/>
            them, they are said to be really the same <lb/>
            plant), which is largely described by <lb/>
            Dioscorides, Theophrastus, and Pliny, is <lb/>
            unknown in England, and is by modern <lb/>
            botanists called Thapsia Garganica. It <lb/>
            appears from the old grammarians that <lb/>
            it was a plant used by dyers : and that <lb/>
            it imparted a yellow cadaverous hue <lb/>
            which was associated by the ancients <lb/>
            with the pallor of sickness and death; <lb/>
            an association heightened by the fortui­ <lb/>
            tous similarity of the name to derivatives <lb/>
            of <foreign xml:lang="grc">θάπτω</foreign>. Thus Plutarch (Phocion, cap. <lb/>
            28) speaks of <foreign xml:lang="grc">θάψινον χρω̑μα</foreign> Kal <foreign xml:lang="grc">νεκρω̑δες</foreign>. <lb/>
            And Thcocritus (ii. 85—88, cited by the <lb/>
            Scholiast) says, <figure type="illustration">

            chius, Photius, and other grammarians, <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">θάψινον</foreign> is explained by <foreign xml:lang="grc">ξανθὸν</foreign>, and the <lb/>
            plant is described as in use for dyeing <lb/>
            wool and hair. In Roman poetry the <lb/>
            lutum, our dyer's weed (Reseda luteola) <lb/>
            holds much the same position as the <lb/>
            Thapsus held among the Greeks. Thus <lb/>
            Horace (Epode x. 16) describes the colour <lb/>
            of checks blanched by fear as pallor <lb/>
            LUTEUS, and Tibullus (i. 8. 52) says of <lb/>
            the sickness of love, <lb/>
            non illi sontica causa est, <lb/>
            Sed nimius LUTO corpora tangit amor.</p>

            threw herself, with her youngest child <lb/>
            Melicertes, into the sea, formed one of <lb/>
            the most moving tragedies of Euripides. <lb/>
            See Acharnians, 434. And the line <lb/>
            before us no doubt refers to some scene <lb/>
            in that Play where Ino in her desolation <lb/>
            and misery throws herself at the feet <lb/>
            sive imaginis Deæ cujusdam, as Conz <lb/>

            (<foreign xml:lang="grc">παρὰ προσδοκίαν</foreign>) out of sheer mischief <lb/>
            for the purpose of connecting the solemn <lb/>

          <p>tion (supra 1259), and tries the effect of <lb/>
            a Sybaritic apologue.</p>
          <p>1431. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἔρδοιτις</foreign>.] The three Latin ver­ <lb/>
            sions of this well-known proverb,— <lb/>
            Cicero's iambic, Quam quisque nôrit artem <lb/>
            in hâc se exercent (Tusc. Disp. i. 18),— <lb/>
            Horace's hexameter, Quam scit uterque, <lb/>
            libens censebo exercent artem (Epist. i. <lb/>
            14. 44),—and the pentameter of Proper­ <lb/>
            tius, Quâ pote quisque in eâ conterat <lb/>
            arte diem (ii. 1. 46, which, however, is <lb/>
            hardly to be considered a version of the <lb/>
            proverb), have already been quoted by <lb/>
            various commentators. And Dindorf <lb/>
            efers to Athenæus, viii. 44.</p>
          <p>1432. <foreign xml:lang="grc">Πιττάλου</foreign>.]To the battered Sy­ <lb/>
            barite the proverb conveyed a reproof <lb/>
            for his rashness in practising an art in <lb/>
            which he was unskilled. To the battered <lb/>
            Athenian it conveys a hint for his future <lb/>
            conduct. “Do not indulge in litigation, <lb/>
            which is not your business and of which <lb/>
            you know nothing: but go to Pittalus <lb/>
            (the great Athenian doctor of the day, <lb/>
            Ach. 1032, 1222), and get your hurts <lb/>
            treated.' Such is, I suppose, the ap­ <lb/>
            plication of the anecdote: if indeed <lb/>
            it has any application at all, and is <lb/>
            not rather one of those tales described <lb/>
            supra 1321, as <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐδὲν εἰκτας τῷ πράγματι</foreign>. <lb/>

            Quite badly too. Fact was, he could not drive. <lb/>
            There was a friend of his stood by, and said, <lb/>
            Let each man exercise the art he knows. <lb/>
            So you, run off to Doctor Pittalus.</p>
          <p>BDEL. Ay, this is like the rest of your behaviour.</p>
          <p>COMP. (To Bdel.) You, sir, yourself, remember what he says.</p>
          <p>PHIL. Stop, listen. Once in Sybaris a girl <lb/>
            Fractured a jug. COMP. I call you, friend, to witness.</p>
          <p>PHIL. Just so the jug : it called a friend to witness. <lb/>
            Then said the girl of Sybaris, By'r Lady, <lb/>
            If you would leave off calling friends to witness, <lb/>
            And buy a rivet, you would, show more brains.</p>
          <p>COMP. Jeer, till the Magistrate call on my case.</p>
          <p>BDEL. No, by Demeter, but you shan't stop here, <lb/>
            I'll take and carry you— PHIL. What now ! BDEL. What now ? <lb/>
            Carry you in : or soon there won't be sompnours <lb/>
            Enough for all your summoning complainants.</p>

            plainly addressed to Bdelycleon, whose <lb/>
            observation in the preceding line had <lb/>
            shown that he was alive to his father's <lb/>

          <p>1446. <foreign xml:lang="grc">Αἴσωπον</foreign>.] It is said that the <lb/>
            Delphians, enraged at the sarcasms of <lb/>
            Æsop, concealed a sacred cup amongst <lb/>
            his baggage as he was leaving Delphi. <lb/>
            They then pursued and overtook him; <lb/>
            and the cup being found in his posses­ <lb/>
            sion, he was condemned to death on the <lb/>
            charge of theft and sacrilege. It was as <lb/>
            he was being led out to execution, that <lb/>
            he told them the fable of the Eagle and <lb/>
            the Beetle; seeking to warn his enemies <lb/>
            that though he might be mean as the <lb/>
            beetle, and they exalted as the eagle, yet <lb/>
            his blood might ascend to heaven and <lb/>
            cry for vengeance upon his murderers. <lb/>
            And it is for the like purpose, viz. as a <lb/>
            protest by the weak against the strong, <lb/>
            that Philocleon would fain employ it <lb/>
            here, as he is borne out, powerless, in the <lb/>
            arms of his son. The fable is preserved <lb/>
            by the Scholiast on Peace, 129. The <lb/>
            eagle had carried off the young beetles: <lb/>
            thereupon the old beetle got into the <lb/>
            eagle's eyry and pushed out her eggs. <lb/>
            The eagle flew to complain to Zeus, who <lb/>
            bade her build her nest in his owu <lb/>
            bosom. But when the eagle had laid <lb/>
            her eggs there, the beetle flew buzzing <lb/>
            about the ears of Zeus ; and he spring­ <lb/>
            ing up to brush it away, dropped and <lb/>
            broke the eggs. The moral, says the <lb/>
            Scholiast, is that there is no rest for the <lb/>
            wicked, no, not even in the bosom of <lb/>
            Zeus. See the note on Peace, 129, from <lb/>
            which the foregoing is an extract. A <lb/>
            third reference to the fable occurs in <lb/>
            Lysistrata, 695.</p>

            an expression of the speaker's impatience <lb/>

            Another path to try. <lb/>
            Now all to soft indulgence <lb/>
            His eager soul will take, <lb/>
            And yet perchance it will not, <lb/>
            For, ah ! ’tis hard to break <lb/>
            From all your life-long habits; <lb/>
            Yet some the change have made,</p>

            return, after an interruption of about 200 <lb/>
            lines, to the original scheme of the Play. <lb/>
            Every sentence of this little chorus be­ <lb/>
            longs to a period, when the issue of <lb/>
            Bdelycleon's experiment was yet uncer­ <lb/>
            tain, and before the dry and law-loving <lb/>
            Heliast had developed into the turbulent <lb/>
            and reckless contemner of law. How, <lb/>
            for instance, is the expression, <foreign xml:lang="grc">τάχα δ</foreign>’ <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἂν</foreign> <lb/>
            Venus <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐκ ἐθέλοι</foreign>, compatible with the fact <lb/>
            that Philocleon had already shown him­ <lb/>
            self ready, and eager, to go all lengths <lb/>
            in his new career of pleasure and dissi­ <lb/>
            pation ? How could such a phrase as <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">σεμνοτέροις πράγμασι</foreign> be applied without <lb/>
            absurdity to the scenes which had <lb/>
            recently been witnessed ? How could <lb/>
            the Chorus say that Bdelycleon had got <lb/>
            the better in every argument, when <lb/>
            Philoclcon had just set him and his ar­ <lb/>
            guments at defiance, and he had found <lb/>
            it impossible to control his father other­ <lb/>
            wise than by an exercise of physical <lb/>
            force ?</p>

            tinas, Carcinus, and Phrynichus, were <lb/>
            called <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὀρχηστικοὶ</foreign>, dancers ; because they <lb/>
            not only used much dancing in the <lb/>
            Choruses of their Plays, but they were <lb/>
            common dancing-masters, teaching any­ <lb/>
            body that had a mind to learn." And <lb/>
            to the same purpose Aristotle (Poet. iv.) <lb/>
            says that " the first Poetry of the stage <lb/>
            was <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὀρχηστικωτέρα</foreign>, more set upon dances <lb/>
            than that of the following ages." I am <lb/>
            citing from Bentley (Phalaris, Disserta­ <lb/>

            sage was properly arranged, emended, <lb/>
            and explained. See the extract at the <lb/>

            into which Philocleon is now carried by <lb/>
            the wine are in entire conformity with <lb/>
            his previous character: the performances <lb/>
            of Thespis and Phrynichus, the earliest <lb/>
            composers of Tragedy, had naturally <lb/>
            been the delight of his boyhood: and <lb/>
            even throughout the austere duties of <lb/>
            his dicastic life, he had cherished a <lb/>
            pleasant remembrauce of their orchestral <lb/>
            melodies. See supra 269. On the other <lb/>
            hand, the gross scenes through which <lb/>
            we have passed are as much out of <lb/>

            ley was the first to arrange this passage <lb/>
            rightly. See the extract below. "The <lb/>
            old fellow," he observes, "begins to <lb/>
            dance, and as he dances, he says, Make <lb/>
            room there, for I'm beginning a dance <lb/>
            that's enough to strain a man's side with <lb/>
            the violent motion." Theodoret (Hist. <lb/>
            Ecel. ii. 27) uses the expression <foreign xml:lang="grc">τινὰ τω̑ν <lb/>

            valent to saying, "The man's mad <lb/>

            ence to Bentley's celebrated emendation <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">πλήσσει</foreign>, because any one who has seen <lb/>
            a cock about to strike, must have ob­ <lb/>
            served the manner in which it crouches <lb/>
            and sidles down immediately before it <lb/>
            delivers its blow. I imagine the old <lb/>
            man to stoop, usiug the. well-known <lb/>
            proverb <foreign xml:lang="grc">πτήσσει Φρύνιχος</foreign>, but giving it <lb/>
            a new turn by adding <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὤς τις άλέϰτωρ <lb/>
            έκλακίζων</foreign>. The servant, who sees what <lb/>
            this stooping posture indicates, cries out <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">Τάχαβλλήσεις</foreign>, and sure enough the <lb/>
            fling immediately follows. See however <lb/>
            the extract at the end of these notes. <lb/>
            That the Phrynichus here mentioned is <lb/>
            in truth, as Bentley says, the ancient <lb/>
            tragedian, the scholar of Thespis, is in <lb/>
            my judgment conclusively established <lb/>
            by the fact that these Phrynichean <lb/>
            dances are <foreign xml:lang="grc">τάϱχαἴ έκει̑ν'οἶςθέσπις <lb/>
            ήγωνίζετο</foreign>. And cf. supra 220. It is <lb/>
            surprising that Sluiter (Lect. Andoc. vi. <lb/>
            120) and Meineke (Hist. Crit. 149, and <lb/>
            Vind. Aristoph.) should fall into the <lb/>
            long-exploded error of supposing that <lb/>
            Aristophanes is here referring to some <lb/>
            unknown contemporary actor, whose <lb/>
            existence is inferred from certain ob­ <lb/>
            scure passages in Andoc. de Myst. 47, <lb/>
            and the Scholiast on Clouds, 1091, and <lb/>
            Birds, 750. And the reason which they <lb/>
            give is as surprising as the error itself. <lb/>
            " Phrynichum," says Meineke, " non esse <lb/>
            nobilem tragicum ab Aristophane sum­ <lb/>
            mis laudibus ornatum temporum ra­ <lb/>

          <p>And the tendons crack. XANTH. 0, hellebore drink !</p>
          <p>PulL. Cocklike, Phrynichus crouches and cowers, <lb/>
            XANTH. You'll strike by and by.</p>

          <p>XANTH. 0 look to yourself, look out, look out.</p>
          <p>PHIL. For now in these sinewy joints of ours <lb/>
            The cup-like socket is twirled about.</p>
          <p>BDEL. 'Twon't do, by Zeus : 'twon't do : 'tis downright madness.</p>
          <p>PaiL. Come on, I challenge all the world to dance. <lb/>
            Now what tragedian thinks he dances well, <lb/>
            Let him come in and dance a match with me. <lb/>
            Well, is there one, or none ? BDEL. Here's only one.</p>
          <p>PHIL. Who's he, poor devil ? BDEL. 'Tis the midmost son</p>
          <p>than that Aristophanes is speaking of a <lb/>
            Phrynichus qui dudum ad plures abi­ <lb/>
            erat, one <foreign xml:lang="grc">τω̑ν άρχαίων</foreign>, not <foreign xml:lang="grc">τω̑ν νυ̑ν</foreign>. The <lb/>
            entire scene turns on the fact that <lb/>
            Philocleon is giving a specimen, not of <lb/>
            modern dancing, but of the old-fashioned <lb/>
            performances of the early stage as con­ <lb/>
            trasted with modern dancing.</p>
          <p>1495. <foreign xml:lang="grc">στρέφεται κοτυληδών</foreign>.] In strict­ <lb/>
            ness perhaps the word <foreign xml:lang="grc">στρέφεται</foreign> should <lb/>
            be applied, not to the socket, but to the <lb/>
            thigh-bone which turns within it: as in <lb/>
            Aristotle's definition of <foreign xml:lang="grc">κοτυληδὼν</foreign> (cited <lb/>
            by Richter), TO <foreign xml:lang="grc">έν ψ στρέφεται ό μηρός</foreign> <lb/>
            (Hist. Animal. I. x. 3). The next two <lb/>
            words, OVK <foreign xml:lang="grc">εὕ</foreign>,are by Dobree annexed to <lb/>
            Philocleon's speech, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ούκεὕ; ΒΔ. μὰ Δἶ <lb/>

            BDEL. No, no, by Zeus, 'tis downright <lb/>
            madness. And this is both an ingenious <lb/>
            and a probable suggestion.</p>
          <p>1497. <foreign xml:lang="grc">άνείπω</foreign>.] See the note on Peace, <lb/>
            551. <foreign xml:lang="grc">άνείπω</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">κλω̑</foreign> are ill the sub­ <lb/>
            junctive mood. The challenge itself is <lb/>
            conveyed in the two following lines.</p>
          <p>1501. <foreign xml:lang="grc">Καρκίνου</foreign>.] Philocleon holds the <lb/>
            lists against all comers, as the champion <lb/>
            of the older tragic dances, the dances of <lb/>
            Phrynichus and Thespis. Three repre­ <lb/>
            sentatives of the modern school of tragic <lb/>
            dancing now enter, one by one, to accept <lb/>
            his challenge, and contend against him <lb/>
            in a trial of skill. They are the three <lb/>
            deformed and stunted sons of Carcinus, <lb/>
            the constant butts of Aristophanes for <lb/>
            their preposterous dances, and their <lb/>
            grotesque and ungainly gestures. The <lb/>
            remainder of the Play is occupied by the <lb/>
            contest, and enlivened by a running fire <lb/>
            of jokes upon the name of Carcinus <lb/>
            (Crabbe). So far as we can judge from <lb/>
            the doubtful and conflicting statements <lb/>
            contained in the Aristophanic Scholia, <lb/>
            it would seem that Carcinus had four <lb/>
            sons, though Aristophanes only speaks <lb/>
            of three. These three were dancers in <note type="footnote"> G g 2 </note> <pb n="228"/>

            one of them, Xenocles (Thesm. 169,440; <lb/>
            Frogs, 86), being also himself a tragic <lb/>
            poet. Another son was named Xeno­ <lb/>
            timus, but the names of the third and <lb/>
            fourth sons (if there was a fourth) are <lb/>
            uncertain. Iu the Scholia on Clouds, <lb/>
            1261, the sons of Careinus are called <lb/>
            Xenocles, Xenotimus, and Demotimus: <lb/>
            on Peace, 778, Xenocles, Xenotimus, and <lb/>
            Xenarchus: on Frogs, 86, Xenocles, <lb/>
            Xenotimus. and Xenoclitus : whilst an­ <lb/>
            other Scholiast there adds a fourth <lb/>
            name, Datis. The name of Datis is also <lb/>
            given to a tragic poet, son of Careinus, <lb/>
            by the Scholiast on Peace, 289. Here <lb/>
            too the Scholiast recognizes four sons, <lb/>

            the size of a pea, and thence in modern <lb/>
            times called the pea-crab, which en­ <lb/>
            sconces itself within the shell of some <lb/>
            living pinna, mussel, cockle, or oyster, <lb/>

            ture, unable even to cater for its own <lb/>
            support, without the assistance of the <lb/>
            little pea-crab. Accordingly the two <lb/>
            combined together, and worked in unison <lb/>
            for their joint subsistence. The pinna, <lb/>
            having got its little guest safely lodged <lb/>
            within, left its shell open: and so soon <lb/>
            as any food came between the valves, <lb/>
            the pea-crab gave its host a sharp nip, <lb/>
            which, caused it instantly to close its <lb/>
            shells, and so to secure the prey. It was <lb/>
            commonly supposed that the pea-crab <lb/>
            was necessary to the very existence of <lb/>
            the pinna, and that if it were removed, <lb/>
            the pinna would die. Hence the little <lb/>

              It may perhaps be represented to the <lb/>
              English ear by the following translation <lb/>
              of lines 1531-2, <lb/>
              For hither is creeping along | the Ocean Lord, their father, <lb/>

              The same metre is found in Eccl. 580, <lb/>
              <foreign xml:lang="grc">μισοῦσι γὰρ ἢν τὰ παλαιὰ πολλάκις θεω̑νται</foreign>. <lb/>
              Its nature is explained in Hephæstion's <lb/>
              fifteenth chapter, and Gaisford's notes <lb/>
              there. The anapæstic section of the <lb/>
              verse is sometimes considered to end <lb/>
              with the second anapaest (according to <lb/>
              the scheme above), and then the second <lb/>
              half is iambic : or sometimes it annexes <lb/>
              the succeeding syllable, <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BELL_10_fig377.jpg"/></figure><lb/>
              and then the second half is ithyphallic, <lb/>
              i. e. composed of three trochees, <figure type="illustration">

               It was on the latter principle that <lb/>
              Archilochus, who invented these verses, <lb/>
              generally divided them. Hephæstion <lb/>
              gives the following example from Archi­ <lb/>
              lochus, ’<foreign xml:lang="grc">Ερασμονίδη Χαρίλαε</foreign>—<foreign xml:lang="grc">χρη̑μά τοι <lb/>
              γελοῖον</foreign>. But subsequent writers used <lb/>
              both cæsuras indiscriminately. The <lb/>
              first section of the line was also some­ <lb/>
              times regarded as composed of an Ionic <lb/>

            shore and with an ebbing tide, I have <lb/>
            frequently remarked the appearance of <lb/>
            a dark cloud, or rather, very thick mist, <lb/>
            hanging over the edge of the water to <lb/>
            the height, perhaps, of half a yard, and <lb/>
            of the breadth of two or three yards, <lb/>
            stretching along the coast as far as the <lb/>
            eye could reach, and always retiring with <lb/>
            the water. When this cloud came to be <lb/>
            examined, it proved to be nothing else <lb/>
            than so much space filled with young <lb/>
            shrimps, in the act of bounding in the <lb/>
            air, from the shallow margin of the <lb/>
            water, or from the wet sand." Bergler <lb/>
            compares the iambic line and a half <lb/>
            cited by Athenæus (iii. GO) in his chap­ <lb/>
            ter on shrimps, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὠρχοῦντο δ</foreign>’ <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὡς καρῖδες, <lb/>

            The phrase <foreign xml:lang="grc">παρὰ θῖν</foreign>’ <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἁλὸς ἀτρυγέτοιο</foreign> is, <lb/>
            of course, of perpetual occurrence in <lb/>

            to take this as if it were Kara <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὀ Φρυνίχειον</foreign>, <lb/>
            in Phrynichus's way. See the extract <lb/>
            at the end of these notes. And so <lb/>
            Bergler and Brunck translate it, Phry­ <lb/>

            should rather suppose <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐκλάκτισμα</foreign> to be <lb/>
            understood, TO <foreign xml:lang="grc">Φρυνίχειον ἐκλάκτισμα ἐκ­ <lb/>

            ley's conjecture for <foreign xml:lang="grc">ᾄδοντες</foreign>, is now fully <lb/>
            confirmed by the MSS. A syllable was <lb/>
            wanting after <foreign xml:lang="grc">σκέλος</foreign>, and I have inserted <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὦδε</foreign> there. The Chorus seem to be join­ <lb/>

            here give a specimen of the action which <lb/>
            they are recommending. See supra 279, <lb/>
            688, 1169; Peace, 57; Eccl. 260, and <lb/>
            frequently elsewhere. The dance itself <lb/>
            is evidently a caricature of the <foreign xml:lang="grc">τραγικαὶ <lb/>
            ὀρχήσεις</foreign> : a grotesque and extravagant <lb/>
            caricature, no doubt: and Bergler says, <lb/>
            “Cordacem saltant: huc enim respicit <lb/>
            Scholiastes in Nub. 542, quum ait <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸν <lb/>

            There is certainly no other scene to <lb/>
            which that Scholiast could be referring, <lb/>
            but I do not know whether the term <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">κορδαξ</foreign> would be strictly applicable to <lb/>

          <p>I SUBJOIN an extract from Bentley's Dissertations on Phalaris. In the <lb/>
            Eleventh Dissertation, " Age of Tragedy," from which this extract is <lb/>
            taken, he is engaged in showing that Tragedy properly so called, the <lb/>
            Tragedy of Thespis and Phrynichus, was unknown in the days of <lb/>
            the tyrant of Agrigentum. In fixing the date of Phrynichus, he has <lb/>
            occasion to contend that there were not, as some say, two tragic poets <lb/>
            of that name, viz. (1) an elder Phrynichus, the son of Polyphradmon <lb/>
            and scholar of Thespis; and (2) a later Phrynichus, the son of <lb/>
            Melanthas, the author of the <foreign xml:lang="grc">Φοίνισσαι</foreign> and the <foreign xml:lang="grc">Μιλήτου ἅλωσις</foreign>; <lb/>
            but that these two alleged Phrynichuses were really one and the same <lb/>
            person. And after many other arguments, lie proceeds to consider <lb/>
            the manner in which Phrynichus is mentioned in the Wasps.</p>
          <p>“Aristophanes in his Vespæ says that the old men at Athens used to sing the <lb/>
            old songs of Phrynichusa, <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BELL_10_fig382.jpg"/></figure> <lb/>
              'Tis a conceited word of the poet's own making, and <foreign xml:lang="grc">σιδωνο</foreign> which is one member <lb/>
              in the composition of it, relates to the Phœnissæ (i. e. the Sidonians), a play of <lb/>
              Phrynichus's, as the Scholiast well observes. Here we see the author of Phœnissæ <lb/>
              (whom they suppose to be the latter Phrynichus) is meant by Aristophanes: but if <lb/>
              I prove too that Aristophanes in this very place meant the Phrynichus Thespis's <lb/>
              scholar, 'twill be evident that these two Phrynichuses (whom they falsely imagine) <lb/>
              are really one and the same. Now that Aristophanes meant the scholar of Thespis <lb/>
              will appear from the very words <foreign xml:lang="grc">μέλη ἀρχαῖα</foreign>, ancient songs and tunes. Ancicnt, <lb/>
              because that Phrynichus was the second, or, as some in Plato thought, the first <lb/>
              author of tragedy; and songs and tunes because he was celebrated and famous by <lb/>
              that very character. Phrynichus, says the Scholiast on this place \ had a mighty <lb/>
              name for making of songs: but in another place he says the same thing of <lb/>
              Phrynichus the son of Pulyphradmon, who, according to Suidas, was Thespis's <lb/>
              scholar: He was admired, says he, for the making of songsc; they cry him up for <lb/>
              the composing of tunes; and he was before Æschylusd. And can it be doubted then, <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BELL_10_fig383.jpg"/></figure> <lb/>
               <pb n="237"/>
              any longer, but that the same person is meant ? 'Tis a problem of Aristotle's, <foreign xml:lang="grc">Διὰ <lb/>
              τί οἱ περὶ Φρὑνιχον μᾶλλον ἦσαν μελοποιοί</foreign>; Why did Phrynichus make more songs <lb/>
              than any tragedian does now-a-dayse?And he answers it,'H <foreign xml:lang="grc">διὰ τὸ πολλαπλάσια <lb/>
              εἶναι τύτε τὰ μέλη ἐν ταῖς τῶν μέτρων τραγῳδίαις</foreign>; correct it <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὰ μέλη τῶν μέτρων ἐν ταῖς <lb/>
              τραγῳδίαις</foreign>. Was it, says he, because at that time the songs (sung by the Chorus) in <lb/>
              tragedies were many more than the verses (spoken by the actors)? Does not <lb/>
              Aristotle's very question imply that there was but one Phrynichus a tragedian ?</p>
          <p>“ I will add one argument more for it, and that, if I do not much mistake, will put <lb/>
            an end to the controversy. For I will prove that the very passage in Aristophanes, <lb/>
            where the Scholiast, and Suidas from him, tell us of this (supposed second) <lb/>
            Phrynichus the son of Melanthas, concerns the one and true Phrynichus the <lb/>
            scholar of Thespis. The ancient poets, says Athenæusf, Thespis, Pratinas, <lb/>
            Carrinus, and Phrynichus, were culled <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὀρχηστικοὶ</foreign>, dancers; because they not only <lb/>
            used much dancing in the choruses of their plays, but they were common dancing- <lb/>
            masters, teaching anybody that had a mind to learn. And to the same purpose <lb/>
            Aristotle s tells us, that the first poetry of the stage was <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὀρχηστικωτέρα</foreign>, more set upon <lb/>
            dances than that of the following ages. This being premised (though I had occasion <lb/>
            to speak of it before), I shall now set down the words of the poeth, <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BELL_10_fig384.jpg"/></figure> <lb/>
              which are spoken by a servant concerning an old fellow, his master, that was in a <lb/>
              frolic of dancing. Who the Thespis was that is here spoken of, the Scholiast and <lb/>
              Suidas pretend to tell us: for they say, ’twas one Thespis a harper, not the tragic <lb/>
              poet1. To speak freely, the place has not been understood this thousand years and <lb/>
              more, being neither written nor pointed right. For what can be the meaning of <lb/>
              <foreign xml:lang="grc">κρόνους τὸν νοῦν</foreign>? The word <foreign xml:lang="grc">κρόνος</foreign> alone signifies the whole, and TOV <foreign xml:lang="grc">νοῦν</foreign> is super­ <lb/>
              fluous and needless. So in another placeJ, <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BELL_10_fig385.jpg"/></figure> <lb/>
              I humbly conceive the whole passage should be thus read and distinguished, <figure type="illustration">

              All night long, says he, he dances those old dances that Thespis used in his choruscs : <lb/>
              and he says he'll dance here upon the stage by and by, and show the tragedians of <lb/>
              these times to be a parcel of fools, he'll out-dance them so much. Andwho can doubt <lb/>
              now, that considers what I have newly quoted from Athenæus, but that Tbespis <lb/>
              <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὀ ἀρχα</foreign>ȋ<foreign xml:lang="grc">ος</foreign>, the old tragic poet (who lived CXIV years before the date of this play), <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὁ <lb/>
              ὀρχηστικὸς</foreign>, the common dancing-master at Athens, is meant here by Aristophanes ? <lb/>
              So that the Scholiast and Suidas may take their harper again for their own diver­ <lb/>
              sion : for it was a common practice among those grammarians, when they happened <lb/>
              to be at a loss, to invent a story for the purpose. But to go on with Aristophanes <lb/>
              the old fellow begins to dance, and as he dances, he says, <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BELL_10_fig387.jpg"/></figure> <lb/>
              So the interlocution is to be placed here, which is faulty in all the editions. Make <lb/>
              room there, says he,for I'm beginning a dance that's enough to strain a man's side <lb/>
              with the violent motion. After a line or two, he adds, <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BELL_10_fig388.jpg"/></figure> <lb/>
              Thus these words are to be pointed, which have hitherto been falsely distinguished. <lb/>
              But there's an error here of a worse sort which has possessed the copies of this <lb/>
              play ever since Adrian's time, and perhaps before. <foreign xml:lang="grc">Πτήσσω</foreign> signifies to crouch and <lb/>
              sneak away for fear as poultry do at the sight of the kite, or a cock, when he is <lb/>
              beaten at fighting. The Scholiastk and Ælian1 tell us that <foreign xml:lang="grc">πτήσσει Φρύνιχος, ὥσπερ <lb/>
              ἀλέκτωρ</foreign>, Phrynichus sneaks like a cock, became a proverb upon those that came off <lb/>
              badly in any affair; because Phrynichus the tragedian came off sneakingly when <lb/>
              he was fined 1000 drachms for his play <foreign xml:lang="grc">Μιλήτου ἅλωσις</foreign>. Now, with clue reverence <lb/>
              to antiquity, I crave leave to suspect that this is a proverb coined on purpose, <lb/>
              because the commentators were puzzled here. For, in the first place, to sneak away <lb/>
              like a cock, seems to be a very improper similitude : for a cock is one of the most <lb/>
              bold and martial of birds. I know there's an expression like this, of some nameless <lb/>
              poet’s <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BELL_10_fig389.jpg"/></figure></p>
          <p>He sneaked like a cock that hangs down his wings when he's beaten m. <note type="footnote"> k Sehol. ibid. </note><note type="footnote"> 1 Ælian, Var.

             <pb n="239"/>
            But this case is widely different: for the comparison here is very elegant and <lb/>
            natural, because the circumstance of being beaten is added to it; but to say it in general <lb/>
            of a cock, as if the whole species were naturally timid, is unwarrantable and absurd. <lb/>
            As in another instance : he stares like a man frightened out of his wits, is an <lb/>
            expression proper enough: but we cannot say in general, he stares like a man. <lb/>
            I shall hardly believe, therefore, that Aristophanes, the most ingenious man of an <lb/>
            age that was fertile of great wits, would let such an expression pass him, he sneaks <lb/>
            like a cock. But, in the next place, the absurdity of it is doubled and tripled by the <lb/>
            sentence that it's joined with: Phrynichus, says he, kicking his legs up to the very <lb/>
            heavens in his dances, crouches and sneaks like a cock. This is no better than <lb/>
            downright nonsense; though, to say something in excuse for the interpreters, they <lb/>
            did not join <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐκλακτίζων</foreign> with <foreign xml:lang="grc">Φρύνιχος</foreign>, as I do, but with the word that follows in the <lb/>
            next verse. But, if the reader pleases to consult the passage in the poet, he will be <lb/>
            convinced that the construction can be no other than what I have made it. <foreign xml:lang="grc">Ἐκλακ­ <lb/>
            τισμὸς</foreign>, says Hcsychius, <foreign xml:lang="grc">σχῆμα χορικὸν, ὀρχήσεως σύντονον</foreign>, (correct it <foreign xml:lang="grc">σχῆμα χορικῆς <lb/>
            ὀρχήσεως, σύντονον</foreign>n,) was a sort of dance lofty and vehement, used by the choruses. <lb/>
            And Julius Pollux, <foreign xml:lang="grc">Τὰ ἐκλακτίσματα, γυναικῶν ἦν ὀρχήματα ἔδει γὰρ ὑπὲρ</foreign> TOP <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὦμον <lb/>
            ὲκλακτίσαι</foreign>: tile <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐκλατίσματα</foreign>, says he, were tile dances of women ; for they were to kick <lb/>
            their heels higher than their shoulders °. But I conceive here's a palpable fault in <lb/>
            this passage of Pollux: for certainly this kind of dance would be very unseemly <lb/>
            and immodest in women. And the particle <foreign xml:lang="grc">γὰρ</foreign>,for, does further show the reading <lb/>
            to be faulty. For how can the throwing up the heels as high as the head in dancing, <lb/>
            be assigned as a reason why the dance must belong to women ? It would rather <lb/>
            prove it belonged to men, because it required great strength and agility. But the <lb/>
            error will be removed, if instead of <foreign xml:lang="grc">γυναικῶν</foreign> we correct it <foreign xml:lang="grc">γυμνικῶν</foreign>. The dance, <lb/>
            says he, was proper to the <foreign xml:lang="grc">γυμνικοὶ</foreign>, exercisers; for the legs were to be thrown up <lb/>
            very high, and consequently it required teaching and practice. Well, it's evident <lb/>
            now, how every way absurd and improper the present passage of Aristophanes is. <lb/>
            If I may have leave to offer at the emendation of so inveterate an error, I would <lb/>
            read the place thus; <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BELL_10_fig390.jpg"/></figure> <lb/>
              i. e. Phrynichus STRIKES like a cock, throwing up his heels very lofty. This is spoken <lb/>
              by the old fellow while he's cutting his capers; and in one of his frisks he offers to <lb/>
              strike the servant that stood by, with his foot as it was aloft. Upon which the <lb/>
              servant says, Tria <foreign xml:lang="grc">βαλλήσεις</foreign>,you’ll hit me by and by with your capering and kicking. <lb/>
              <foreign xml:lang="grc">Πλήσσω</foreign> is the proper term for a cock when he strikes as he's fighting; as <foreign xml:lang="grc">πλῆκτρον</foreign> <lb/>
              is his spur that he strikes with. The meaning of the passage is this, that in his <note type="footnote"> n So Pollux, iv. 14. <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸ σχίστας ἕλκειν, σχῆμα ὀρχήσεως χορικῆς</foreign>. </note><note type="footnote"> o Pollux, ibid. </note> <lb/>

              dances he leaped up and vaulted like Phrynichus, who was celebrated for those <lb/>
              performances : as it further appears from what follows a little after, <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BELL_10_fig391.jpg"/></figure> <lb/>
              which ought to be thus corrected and distinguished, <figure type="illustration">

              i. e. And, in Phrynichus’s way,friskand caper; so as the spectators, seeing your legs <lb/>
              aloft, may cry out with admiration. Now, to draw our inference from these several <lb/>
              passages, it appears, I suppose, sufficiently, that the Phrynichus here spoken of by <lb/>
              Aristophanes was, as well as the Thespis, famous for his dancing, and consequently, <lb/>
              by the authority of Athenæus quoted above, he must be <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὁ ἀρχα</foreign>ȋ<foreign xml:lang="grc">ος Φρύνιχος</foreign>, the <lb/>
              ancient Phrynichus, 6 <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὀρχηστικὸς</foreign>, the master of dancingq. Upon the whole matter, <lb/>

          <p>THE following synopsis is constructed on the same principles as that <lb/>
            contained in my Appendix to the Peace. For an exposition of those <lb/>
            principles, and a brief narrative of the successive stages through which <lb/>
            the Aristophanc text has passed, the reader is referred to that <lb/>
            Appendix. The Wasps is found in the following MSS.:—</p>
          <p>R. The Ravenna MS.</p>
          <p>V. The Venetian.</p>
          <p>P. The first Parisian (No. 2715).</p>
          <p><foreign xml:lang="grc">Π</foreign>. The second Parisian (No. 2717).</p>
          <p>F. The first Florentine (No. 31, 15 in the Laurentian Library).</p>
          <p><foreign xml:lang="grc">Φ</foreign>. The second Florentine (No. 31, 16).</p>
          <p>Vat. The Vaticano-Palatine.</p>
          <p>The readings of the RavEnna and Venetian manuscripts are given in <lb/>
            accordance with the collation made by Bekker; those of the two <lb/>
            Parisian manuscripts, from Brunck ; and the others, from various <lb/>
            collations, as recorded by Dindorf.</p>
          <p>The editions in my own possession, used In compiling this <lb/>
            synopsis, are as follows :—</p>
          <p>(1) Junta. Florence, 1515. (The editio princeps of the <lb/>
            Lysistrata and Thesmophoriazusæ.)</p>
          <p>(2) Gormont. Paris, 1528.</p>

          <p>(5) Grynæus. Frankfort, 1544.</p>
          <p>(6) Rapheleng. Leyden, 1600.</p>
          <p>(7) Scaliger. Amsterdam, 1670. (This edition goes by the <lb/>
            name of Scaliger because it contains some notes of his : <lb/>
            but he is not responsible for the text.)</p>
          <p>(8) Kuster. Amsterdam, 1710.</p>
          <p>(9) Bergler. Leyden, 1760.</p>
          <p>(10) Brunck. London, 1823.</p>
          <p>(11) Bekker. London, 1829.</p>
          <p>(12) Dindorf. Oxford, 1835.</p>
          <p>(13) ''eise. Leipsic, 1842.</p>
          <p>(14) Bothe. Leipsic, 1845.</p>
          <p>(15) Holden. London, 1848.</p>
          <p>(16) Bergk. Leipsic, 1857.</p>
          <p>(17) Richter’s Wasps. Berlin, 1858.</p>
          <p>(18) Meineke. Leipsic, 1860.</p>
          <p>(19) Holders Wasps. London, 1865</p>
          <p>Mr. Mitchell's edition of the Wasps (to the end of the Parabasis), <lb/>
            London, 1835, merely follows the text of Dindorf. Dr. Holders <lb/>
            earlier edition was also based on Dindorf's text: in his last edition <lb/>
            he substantially follows Meineke, a far less safe guide. Modern <lb/>
            German criticism, as regards Aristophanes at least, is calculated rather <lb/>
            to display the ingenuity of the critic, than to improve the text of the <lb/>
            author. Alterations are introduced, without any semblance of autho­ <lb/>
            rity or probability, apparently for no other reason than that they would, <lb/>
            in the opinion of the editor, have done as well as the received and <lb/>
            authorized reading. Fortunately each succeeding editor, whilst he <lb/>
            introduces a host of novelties of his own, sweeps away all those <lb/>
            introduced by his predecessor, so that we are never more than one <lb/>
            remove distant from the genuine text.</p>
          <p>Recent editors concur in numbering the lines as they are numbered <lb/>
             <pb n="243"/>
            in the text of Brunck’s edition. Owing to this convenient practice, <lb/>
            references to Aristophanes have acquired a fixity and a uniformity <lb/>
            which are wanting in references to Pindar and the Attic Tragedians.</p>
          <p>2. <foreign xml:lang="grc">διδάτκομαι</foreign>. This word is omitted <lb/>
            in V.</p>
          <p>3. <foreign xml:lang="grc">προὐΦείλεις</foreign>. The reading of the <lb/>
            MSS. and most editions is <foreign xml:lang="grc">προὔΦειλες</foreign>, <lb/>
            for which Elmsley (at Eur. Herael. 241) <lb/>
            suggests <foreign xml:lang="grc">προὐΦείλεις</foreign>, and Hamaker sug­ <lb/>
            gests <foreign xml:lang="grc">πρὤΦειλες</foreign>. Elmsley’s suggestion <lb/>
            is adopted by Dindorf, Bothe, Hirschig, <lb/>
            and Bergk; Hamaker's by Meineke <lb/>
            and Holden. Richter reads <foreign xml:lang="grc">πρῷ ᾽Φείλεις</foreign>. <lb/>

            Bothe continues this line to Sosias, and <lb/>
            thenceforward transposes the names of <lb/>
            the speakers.</p>
          <p>9. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀλλ᾽</foreign>. V. omits this word.</p>

            It was ejected by Bentley, Person (at <lb/>
            Hec. 1161), and Elmsley (at Ach. 127). <lb/>
            Their opinion was confirmed by R., and <lb/>
            is followed by all the later editors, ex­ <lb/>
            cept Richter, who retains <foreign xml:lang="grc">τις</foreign>, and Bothe, <lb/>

            not be altogether excluded from Aristo­ <lb/>
            phanes, since it is elsewhere supported <lb/>

            of the eagle into Cleonymus, such as (ho <lb/>

          <p>22. <foreign xml:lang="grc">τί ταυτόν</foreign>. Cobet, Hirschig, and <lb/>
            Richter: and Meineke in his Vind. <lb/>
            Aristoph. appears to approve of this <lb/>
            reading (bnt would also change <foreign xml:lang="grc">ταυτὸν</foreign> <lb/>
            into <foreign xml:lang="grc">ταυτὸν ὄν</foreign>). Moreover it brings the <lb/>
            passage into an exact accord with the <lb/>
            actual riddle quoted. See the note on <lb/>
            the line. Before Brunck the reading <lb/>
            was <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὅ,τι</foreign> which is treated by the Scholiast <lb/>
            as an Attic usage for <foreign xml:lang="grc">τί. ἐν τῷ ὅ,τι</foreign>, he <lb/>
            says, <foreign xml:lang="grc">περιττεύει τὸ</foreign>0 <foreign xml:lang="grc">᾽Αττικῶς τὸ γὰρ <lb/>
            σημαινόμενον ἀντὶ τοῦ τί ταυτὸν ἐν γῇ ἐν <lb/>
            ἐρωτήσει</foreign>. Bergk too in his notes pre­ <lb/>
            fers <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὅ,τι</foreign>. But no such Attic usage is <lb/>
            known : and Brunck introduced <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὅτι</foreign>, <lb/>
            connecting it with <foreign xml:lang="grc">πῶς δὴ</foreign>, “ How comes <lb/>
            it that?” And on is found in most <lb/>
            editions since Brunck (those editors who <lb/>
            follow Bentley's distribution of the pre­ <lb/>
            ceding line connecting <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὅτι</foreign> with <foreign xml:lang="grc">λέγων</foreign>), <lb/>
            and apparently in the MSS. <foreign xml:lang="grc">τ᾽ ἀπέ­ <lb/>
            βαλεν</foreign>. R. V. Bekker, recentiores. In <lb/>
            the old editions the line ran <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὅ,τι ταυτὸν <lb/>

            (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀπέβαλεν. Φ</foreign>.) was substituted for <foreign xml:lang="grc">θηρίον</foreign> <lb/>
            in the following line. P. has <foreign xml:lang="grc">ταυτὸν ἐν γῇ <lb/>
            θηρίον</foreign>, and so Brunck and Weise.</p>
          <p>23. <foreign xml:lang="grc">κἀν τῇ θαλάττῇ. κἄτ᾽ἐν θαλάττῆ</foreign>. <lb/>
            Dobree.</p>

            Bentley, Elmsley (at Ach. 178), Bothe. <lb/>
            No doubt the first syllable may be long, <lb/>
            as infra 384 and in Æsch. Suppl. 277, <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">κα</foreign>ì <foreign xml:lang="grc">Νε</foreign>ȋ<foreign xml:lang="grc">λος ἄν θρέψειε τοιοῦτον Φυτόν</foreign>. But <lb/>
            it is usually short, and it is better to <lb/>
            follow the MS. reading. Meineke adopts <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">τοιοῦτ᾽</foreign> in his text, but repents in his <lb/>
            notes.</p>
          <p>25. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἔσται</foreign>. vulgo. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐστι</foreign>.Hamaker. <lb/>
            The suggestion is founded on a mis­ <lb/>
            understanding of the true sense of the <lb/>
            passage. See the note and the passage <lb/>
            there cited from Alciphron. Hamaker <lb/>

            is supported by the best MS. authority. <lb/>
            The older editions gave the words <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀλλ</foreign>’ <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐδὲν λέγει</foreign> to Sosias (and so, according <lb/>
            to Dindorf, does V., though Bekker says <lb/>
            otherwise); and some gave the following <lb/>
            line to Xanthias, getting back into the <lb/>
            right arrangement at line 78. Meineke <lb/>
            (followed by Holden) gives 74 and half 75 <lb/>
            to Sosias; the rest of 75 and 76 and 77 <lb/>
            to Xanthias; 78 and half 79 to Sosias; <lb/>
            the rest of 79 and 80 to Xanthias; 81 <lb/>
            and 82 to Sosias; and 83—136 to <lb/>
            Xanthias. But the ordinary arrange­ <lb/>
            ment is far better. Richter too divides <lb/>
            the line before us, giving the words <foreign xml:lang="grc">αλλ</foreign>’ <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐδὲν λέγει</foreign> to Sosias. The Scholiast <lb/>
            says, <foreign xml:lang="grc">τινὲς ἀμοιβαῖα. χαριέστερον δὲ λέ. <lb/>

            serving that Sosias was the name of a <lb/>
            slave, and that slaves were not admitted <lb/>
            as spectators. Dobree contests both <lb/>
            propositions, referring to Demosthenes <lb/>
            adv. Macart. 1075; Xenoph. Anab. i. <lb/>
            2. 9; Antiphon, 137, on the first point, <lb/>
            and to Plato, Gorgias, p. 502 D, on the <lb/>
            second. The Scholiast also mentions <lb/>
            two persons, apparently Athenian citi­ <lb/>
            zens, of the name of Sosias. However, <lb/>
            for the reasons given in my note, I <lb/>
            dissent from the received opinion which <lb/>
            makes Sosias here the name of one of <lb/>

            7, p. 315 c," and he is followed by every <lb/>
            subsequent editor. But this is a com­ <lb/>
            plete misapprehension. Athenæus cites <lb/>
            this line, and undoubtedly writes <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὀρφῶς</foreign> <lb/>
            in it with a circumflex. He then ob­ <lb/>
            serves that, notwithstanding this, it was <lb/>
            the Attic usage to write the nominative <lb/>
            singular <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὀρφὼς</foreign>. (<foreign xml:lang="grc">τὴν μέντοι ἑνικὴν εὐθεῖαν <lb/>
            ὀξυτόνως προφέρονται ᾽Αττικαὶ</foreign>), and cites a <lb/>
            line of Archippus in which it is so written, <lb/>
            and a line of Cratinus where the genitive <lb/>
            singular is written <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὀρφώ</foreign> And so the <lb/>
            Scholiast here says, <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸὀρφω̃ς περισπω̑σιν <lb/>
            Ἀττικοι</foreign>.—<foreign xml:lang="grc">μήποτε δὲ καὶ τὸ ἑνικὸν τονἴχθύος <lb/>

            Magn. (sub voc.) says that <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὀρφῶς</foreign> is <lb/>
            written with a circumflex, and cites <lb/>
            Choeroboscus (p. 262. 27, and p. 66. 9) <lb/>
            and the great authority of Herodian to <lb/>
            the same purpose. Several other gram­ <lb/>
            marians refer to the word, and all with <lb/>
            one consent describe it as written with a <lb/>
            circumflex. So far as I know, there <lb/>
            is no authority whatever for writing <lb/>

            Beer, Bergk, and Richter. In addition <lb/>

            The arrangement of the text is that of <lb/>
            Bergk, followed by Richter, Meineke, and <lb/>
            Holden. The sentences here assigned to <lb/>
            Bdelycleon were formerly given to Philo­ <lb/>
            cleon: whilst those here assigned to <lb/>
            Philocleon were given to the servant by <lb/>
            the editions before Brunck, and to Bdely­ <lb/>
            cleon by Brunck, Bekker, Dindorf, Weise, <lb/>
            and Bothe. But it is plain that the per­ <lb/>
            son who went into the house after verse <lb/>
            833 returns here with the <foreign xml:lang="grc">χοιροκομεῖον</foreign>, <lb/>
            and it is equally plain from verse 839 <lb/>
            that Bdelycleon is on the stage during <lb/>
            the interval, whilst the language assigned <lb/>
            to the person who brings the <foreign xml:lang="grc">χοιροκομεῖον</foreign> <lb/>
            suits neither the servant nor Bdelycleon, <lb/>
            but Philocleon alone.</p>

            <foreign xml:lang="grc">προθύρου</foreign> (in which he is followed by <lb/>
            Bekker), observing that the words <foreign xml:lang="grc">πρός <lb/>

            crept into the place of the genuine read­ <lb/>
            ing. In a supplementary note he hit <lb/>
            upon the same emendation as Bentley, <lb/>
            remarking “ ad illud <foreign xml:lang="grc">προπύλαιε</foreign> glossa <lb/>

            this suggestion is adopted by Bergk, <lb/>
            Meineke, and Holden. But it is clear <lb/>
            that Labes is not presented to the Court <lb/>
            until six lines later: and <foreign xml:lang="grc">ου̑́τος</foreign> seems to <lb/>
            be used merely by way of depreciation. <lb/>
            " Where is that fellow, the defendant? " <lb/>
            For <foreign xml:lang="grc">ο̋σον</foreign> Dobree suggests olov, and Reiske <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ο̋σου</foreign>, whilst Bergler places a note of <lb/>
            interrogation after <foreign xml:lang="grc">άλώσεται</foreign>, and takes <lb/>
            it as a question to the servant, who re­ <lb/>
            sponds <foreign xml:lang="grc">τίμημα κλῳὸς σύκινος</foreign>.But <foreign xml:lang="grc">ο̋σον</foreign> <lb/>
            is equivalent to <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὡς</foreign>with an intensified <lb/>
            signification, just as <foreign xml:lang="grc">πόσονδοκει̑ς</foreign> is used <lb/>
            in Eccl. 399 and elsewhere for the more <lb/>
            ordinary <foreign xml:lang="grc">πω̑ς δοκει̑ς</foreign>.</p>
          <p>894. The characters in the trial scene <lb/>
            are variously distributed by the editors : <lb/>
            but it seems to me that all the parts <lb/>
            belonging to the <foreign xml:lang="grc">κήρυξ</foreign> or the <foreign xml:lang="grc">θεσμοθέτης</foreign> <lb/>
            are most properly assigned to Bdelycleon. <lb/>
            The present speech is given by R. and <lb/>
            the old editions to <foreign xml:lang="grc">ΘΕ</foreign>., which Brunck <lb/>
            (apparently taking it for <foreign xml:lang="grc">θεράπων</foreign>, as <lb/>
            Meineke also does) changed into Xan­ <lb/>
            thias. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ΘΕ</foreign>. however stands for <foreign xml:lang="grc">θεσμο­ <lb/>

             <pb n="273"/>
            sonæ in the old editions, and the speech <lb/>
            is rightly assigned to Bdelycleon by <lb/>
            Elmsley, Bergk, Meineke, and Holden. <lb/>
            I do not think it necessary to notice all <lb/>

          <p>1062. <foreign xml:lang="grc">καὶ κατ̕̕̕</foreign>a<foreign xml:lang="grc">ὐτό</foreign>. I give this line as <lb/>
            written by John Seager (Class. Journ. <lb/>
            iv. 714), who is followed by Hirschig and <lb/>
            Richter. The variations, though slight, <lb/>
            are very numerous. The old editions <lb/>
            had <foreign xml:lang="grc">καὶ κατ̕</foreign>a<foreign xml:lang="grc">ὐτό.δὴ τόυ̂το μόνον ἄνδρες <lb/>
            μαχιμώτατοι</foreign>, except Grynæus, who has <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">καὶ κατ̕ αὐτὸτου̂το δὴ μόνον ἄνδρες <lb/>
            τατοι</foreign> (and so Weise and Bothe), which <lb/>
            comes very near the present reading. <lb/>
            In V. and F. it is given <foreign xml:lang="grc">καὶ κατ̕αὐτὸ <lb/>
            τοῦτο μόνον ἄνδρες μαχιμώτατοι</foreign>, and so <lb/>
            (except that it begins <foreign xml:lang="grc">καὶταῦτ̕ αὐτὸ</foreign>) <lb/>
            in R. Bentley proposed <foreign xml:lang="grc">καὶ κατ̕αὐτὸδὴ <lb/>
            μόνον τοῦτ̕ἄνδρεςἀλκιμώτατοι</foreign>(so Porson. <lb/>
            Meineke, Holden), or <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀνδρικώτατοι</foreign> (so <lb/>
            Dindorf). Brunck reads <foreign xml:lang="grc">καὶ κατ̕αὐτὸ <lb/>
            τοῦτο δὴμόνον ἄνδρες γε μαχιμώτατοι</foreign>. <lb/>
            Bergk follows Seager, except that he <lb/>
            omits <foreign xml:lang="grc">δὴ</foreign>, and reads <foreign xml:lang="grc">κεῖϭε</foreign> for <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐκεῖϭε</foreign> in the <lb/>
            antistrophe.</p>

            Suidas s.v. <foreign xml:lang="grc">κύκνυ</foreign>.The Scholiast too <lb/>
            says, <foreign xml:lang="grc">οἱ δὲ διαιροῦϭιν ἀπ̕ἄλλης ἀρχῆςτοῦτο</foreign>, <lb/>

            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἔοικας</foreign>. This change is adopted by every <lb/>
            subsequent editor: but Brunck's reading <lb/>
            has the effect of transferring the imputa­ <lb/>
            tion of corpse-like pallor from Chærephon <lb/>
            (for whom it was obviously intended) to <lb/>
            the Baking-girl. Dobree therefore sug­ <lb/>

            This however involves a double departure <lb/>
            from the MS. reading, and I think it <lb/>
            better to read <foreign xml:lang="grc">κλητεύεις, ἐοικὼς</foreign>, placing <lb/>
            (with all the early editions) a comma <lb/>

            not take leave of that great critic without <lb/>
            observing (what any one who examines <lb/>
             <pb n="291"/>
            this Appendix will perceive) that his <lb/>
            mere marginal jottings have done far <lb/>
            more for the text of Aristophanes than <lb/>
            has been accomplished by the united <lb/>
            efforts of all the commentators, both <lb/>
            before and since his time.</p>
          <p>[I regret that I have not availed myself of the very useful edition of the Wasps <lb/>
            brought out by Mr. Green in the Catena Classicorum. I was under the impression <lb/>
            that the volumes in that series were mere compilations for the use of schools ; but <lb/>
            Mr. Green's edition of the Wasps (which has now happened to come into my hands) <lb/>
            is obviously the well-considered and independent work of a judicious and competent <lb/>
            scholar. Mr. Green had already, I see, referred to the passage of the Menexenus <lb/>
            which I have cited in the note to 639.]</p>
