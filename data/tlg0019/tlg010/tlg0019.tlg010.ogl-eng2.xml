          <p>THE Ecclesiazusae has come down to us unaccompanied by any <lb/>
            didascalia or other evidence of its date, beyond what may be gathered <lb/>
            from the play itself and the comments of the Greek Scholiasts thereon. <lb/>
            But the information derivable from these sources makes it abundantly <lb/>
            clear that the play was exhibited in the spring of the year B.C. 393, <lb/>
            in the third year of the 96th Olympiad, when Eubulides was archon.</p>
          <p>In the opening scenes of the comedy, the women, disguised as men, <lb/>
            are practising the part which they are shortly to play in the Assembly, <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐκκλησία</foreign>, of the Athenian people. And Praxagora, their leader, delivers <lb/>
            a speech of considerable length, in the serious part of which she is <lb/>
            doubtless expounding the poet's own views respecting the political <lb/>
            condition of Athens. She arraigns the policy of the people for its <lb/>
            total want of continuity; she avers that they are perpetually chopping <lb/>
            and changing; enamoured of one course to-day, and of the opposite <lb/>
            course to-morrow; and in illustration of her statement, she says: <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BELL_67_fig1.jpg"/></figure> <lb/>
              " Then again this Alliance, when we were deliberating about it, they <lb/>
              vowed that not to conclude it would be the ruin of the State: but when <lb/>
              once it was concluded, they were disgusted with it; and the orator who <lb/>
              persuaded them into it had straightway to cut and run.” Lines <lb/>
              193-196.</p>
          <p>On this passage the Scholiasts remark, <foreign xml:lang="grc">περὶ του̑ συμμαχικου̑, φιλόχορος</foreign> <lb/>
             <pb n="viii"/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ίστορε</foreign>ȋ on <foreign xml:lang="grc">πρὸ δύο ἐτω̑ν ἐγένετο συμμαχία Λακεδαιμονίων καὶ Βοιωτω̑ν</foreign>. <lb/>
            “ As to the Alliance, Philochorus relates that, two years before, an <lb/>
            Alliance had been concluded between the Lacedaemonians and the <lb/>
            Boeotians." But as the speaker is referring to an alliance entered into <lb/>
            not by the Lacedaemonians, but by the Athenians, Petit has, with <lb/>
            general consent, substituted <foreign xml:lang="grc">Ἀθηναίων</foreign> for <foreign xml:lang="grc">Λακεδαιμονίων</foreign> in the Scholium. <lb/>
            And that this is really what the Scholiasts meant is made still plainer <lb/>
            by the circumstance that the orator who fell into discredit for pushing <lb/>
            the treaty through is by them (on line 196) declared, however wrongly, <lb/>
            to have been the illustrious officer Conon, the inveterate enemy of the <lb/>
            Lacedaemonians.</p>
          <p>We get therefore so far that, according to the statement in the <lb/>
            Scholium, the Ecclesiazusae was acted two years after an alliance had <lb/>
            been contracted between the Athenians and the Boeotians, an alliance <lb/>
            which was considered of momentous, and even of vital, importance to <lb/>
            Athens : and that with this alliance the name of Conon was, or might <lb/>
            have been, in some way connected. And we have next to consider <lb/>
            whether we find in history, within the period admissible for the production <lb/>
            of this play, any treaty of alliance between the Athenians and the <lb/>
            Boeotians which will answer the foregoing conditions.</p>
          <p>Now the disastrous termination of the Peloponnesian War not only <lb/>
            annihilated the Athenian empire, it reduced Athens herself to the position <lb/>
            of a mere satellite and dependency of the Spartan leadership. The <lb/>
            Athenians1 were bound to follow wherever Sparta might lead ; her <note type="footnote"> 1 Xen. Hell. ii. 2. 20. <lb/>
            The Bcytale-dispatch in which the Epbors originally announced the decision <lb/>
            of Sparta as to the fate of her fallen rival is preserved by Plutarch. </note> <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BELL_67_fig2.jpg"/></figure><note type="footnote"> "Gin ye cling doon Peiraeus an' the Lang Shanks" (<foreign xml:lang="grc">τὰ μακρὰ σκέλη</foreign>, the Long <lb/>
              Walls) " an' gang oot o’ a' the touns, an' bide in yer ain countrec, ye can hae <lb/>

              enemies were to be their enemies, and her friends their friends; their <lb/>
              navy was limited to twelve triremes; and the demolition of the Long <lb/>
              Walls left them open at once to a blockade by the formidable armies of <lb/>
              the Peloponnesian Confederacy.</p>
          <p>In this state of humiliation Athens remained for about nine years, <lb/>
            from B. c. 404 to B. c. 395.</p>
          <p>Yet at the very moment of her fall an undercurrent was working <lb/>
            which was ultimately to lift her, not indeed to her former supremacy, <lb/>
            but to a position of dignity and complete independence.</p>
          <p>At the time when Athens lay helpless at the feet of her conquerors, <lb/>
            a great congress was held at Sparta for the purpose of deciding upon <lb/>
            her fate. Many states, and more especially Thebes and Corinth, were <lb/>
            urgent that no terms of any kind should be granted her; insisting that <lb/>
            the city should be razed, and all the citizens sold into slavery; and that <lb/>
            sheep should pasture over the ground which once was Athens. The <lb/>
            Lacedaemonians stood resolutely between Athens and this terrible <lb/>
            vengeance, declaring that they would not reduce to slavery an Hellenic <lb/>
            city, a city too which had done such splendid service for Hellas in the <lb/>
            hour of her gravest peril. And, overruling the eager hostility of the <lb/>
            most powerful members of the Confederacy, they granted the terms of <lb/>
            peace which have already been mentioned 1. <note type="footnote"> 1 Xen. Hell. ii. 2. 19, 20; lacerates, de Pace 94, Plataicus 34; Plutarch, <lb/>
            Lysander, chap. 15. </note><note type="footnote"> Plutarch tells us that Lysander and the allied generals in the camp before <lb/>
            Athens, in the midst of their deliberations as to her fate, adjourned for a while to <lb/>
            a banquet. There, amidst the wine and music, a Phocian sang the opening lines <lb/>
            of the first Choral song in the Electra. of Euripides, Daughter of Agamemnon, <lb/>
            I came, 0 Electra, to thy humble cottage. Thereupon all the company were moved <lb/>
            with compassion, thinking that the fate of that famous princess bore some <lb/>
            resemblance to the fate which they themselves were even then meditating for the <lb/>
            famous city. Thenceforward milder counsels prevailed. </note><note type="footnote"> It is to be hoped that there is some foundation for the anecdote about the <lb/>
            Electra, and that the melodies of Euripides were to some extent instrumental <lb/>
            in mitigating the misfortunes of Athens herself, just as, the same authority <lb/>
            informs us, they had been instrumental, some years before, in ameliorating the <lb/>
            lot of the Athenian prisoners at Syracuse. But the setting in which the anecdote </note></p><pb n="x"/>
            
          <p>No moment in all Hellenic history after the great Persian invasion <lb/>
            was so noble as this, when Sparta saw her great antagonist prostrate at <lb/>
            her feet, forgot the bitter rivalry of the last seven and twenty years, <lb/>
            remembered only their comradeship in the death-struggle against the <lb/>
            Mede, remembered the gallantry and self-devotion of Athens in those <lb/>
            heroic days, and proved herself a worthy representative of the men of <lb/>
            Thermopylae and Plataea. Not a life was taken; no Athenian was <lb/>
            injured in purse or person; no trophies, not even the Spartan shields <lb/>
            captured at Sphacteria, were reclaimed, but Athens was left with all her <lb/>
            wealth of architecture and sculpture, with all her art-treasures, and <lb/>
            temples, and choruses ; still an " eye" of Hellas, still the noblest and <lb/>
            the loveliest of all Hellenic cities.</p>
          <p>The spirit of the dead Callicratidas must have been strong in the <lb/>
            Spartan councils on that day, when the Peloponnesian War was closed <lb/>
            with this great act of forbearance and magnanimity. And yet, though <lb/>
            it displayed Sparta for the moment as the true Pan-Hellenic leader, <lb/>
            though it invested her with a claim to our admiration even surpassing <lb/>
            what is clue to her military glories, it undoubtedly sowed the bitter seed <lb/>
            which culminated in her own downfall.</p>
          <p>Thebes and Corinth, the main props of the Confederacy which acknow­ <lb/>
            ledged the leadership of Sparta, were naturally aggrieved to find their <lb/>
            fondest wishes overruled, and their hostility to Athens rebuked, by the <lb/>
            generous moderation of the Spartan decision. And very shortly after­ <lb/>
            wards the Thebans 1 certainly, and according to Justin the Corinthians <note type="footnote"> has reached us is plainly apocryphal. The fate of Athens was not left to the <lb/>
            decision of Lysander and the allied generals in the camp before her walls. It had <lb/>
            already been determined by the authorities at Sparta. </note><note type="footnote"> 1 Xen. HelL iii. 5. 5; Plutarch, Lysander, chap. 27; Justin. v. 10. Justin's <lb/>
            words are " Interea Thebani Corinthiique legatos ad Lacedaemonios mittunt, qui <lb/>
            ex manubiis portionem praedae communis belli periculique peterent. Quibus <lb/>
            negatis, non quidem aperte bellum adversus Lacedaemonios decernunt, tied <lb/>
            tacitis animis tantam iram concipiunt, ut subesse bellum intelligi posset." <lb/>
            Plutarch, on the other hand, is clear that the Thebans alone made the claim and <lb/>
            received the rebuff, <foreign xml:lang="grc">θηϐαίοι μόνοι, τῶν ἄλλων συμμάχων ήσυχαζύντων</foreign>. And this is <lb/>
            more in accordance with the statement in Xenophon. It seems probable that </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="xi"/>
            -also, received a further rebuff from Sparta: their claim to share in the <lb/>
            wealth which Lysander had brought from Asia for the more effectual <lb/>
            prosecution of the war being absolutely repudiated by the Spartan <lb/>
            government. Thenceforward they began to draw away from her side. <lb/>
            And in the following year when Sparta again summoned her allies to <lb/>
            invade Attica, and put down the popular party under Thrasybulus, it <lb/>
            was noticed that the only states1 which did not obey the summons were <lb/>
            Thebes and Corinth. Nor did these two states ever again act in unison <lb/>
            with that great group of Hellenic peoples which recognized Sparta as <lb/>
            their chief and leader.</p>
          <p>Some two years later the Lacedaemonians went to war with Elis, and <lb/>
            summoned the Confederacy to assist them. Again there were two <lb/>
            exceptions to the unanimity with which the allies, including the <lb/>
            Athenians, obeyed the call; and again those two exceptions2 were <lb/>
            Thebes and Corinth.</p>
          <p>It was, seemingly, in the year B. c. 396 that Agesilaus was planning <lb/>
            his great expedition to Asia Minor. His mind was full of mighty <lb/>
            projects and lofty hopes: even dreaming of those gigantic successes <lb/>
            the achievement of which was reserved for a later period, and for <lb/>
            a Macedonian king. He was a second Agamemnon, conducting the <lb/>
            hosts of all Greece to conquer a mightier Troy : a Pan-Hellenic leader, <lb/>
            retorting upon Persia the invasion of Hellas by Xerxes. He named <lb/>
            a rendezvous to which all the troops were to repair, and sent messengers <lb/>
            to all the Hellenic cities, both within and without Peloponnesus, fixing <lb/>
            the particular quota which each was expected to send 3. The Boeotians <lb/>
            appear to have returned a blunt refusal The Corinthians alleged (and <lb/>
            Pausanias actually gives credit to their allegations) that they were most <lb/>
            desirous of coming, but were deterred by an evil omen, the recent <note type="footnote"> Justin, or rather Trogus Pompeius whom he follows, was misled by the fact that <lb/>
            at this time the Thebans and Corinthians were generally acting together. </note><note type="footnote"> 1 Xen. Bell. ii. 4.

            destruction of their Temple of Olympian Zeus. Anyhow neither. <lb/>
            Thebans nor Corinthians came. On this occasion, too, the Athenians <lb/>
            excused themselves, on the plea that they had not yet sufficiently <lb/>
            recovered from the effects of the Peloponnesian War.</p>
          <p>So far the symptoms of alienation were merely of a negative <lb/>
            character. Thebes and Corinth had not moved with the rest of the <lb/>
            Confederacy at the summons, and under the leadership of Sparta, but <lb/>
            neither had they proceeded to any overt acts of hostility. But before <lb/>
            Agesilaus had started for Asia, the Boeotians had offered to him, and <lb/>
            through him to Sparta, a direct and deliberate insult. The King of <lb/>
            Sparta, in emulation of his great predecessor the King of Mycenae, <lb/>
            was desirous of inaugurating his expedition by a preliminary sacrifice <lb/>
            at Aulis, in honour of the Goddess Artemis 1. He left the fleet assembled <lb/>
            at the southern promontory of Euboea, and came with a single trireme <lb/>
            to Aulis to perform the sacrifice. The victims were slain, their thigh­ <lb/>
            bones and fat were on the altar, the fire was kindled, when suddenly <lb/>
            a squadron of Boeotian cavalry, hastily dispatched by the Boeotarchs, <lb/>
            appeared upon the scene and put a forcible stop to the proceedings; <lb/>
            even driving Agesilaus himself from the temple, and casting from the <lb/>
            altar and throwing about in all directions the half-consumed sacrificial <lb/>
            meats. It was said that the rites were not being performed in the <lb/>
            proper and customary manner; but we are not here concerned with <lb/>
            the right or wrong of the affair. In any case the conduct of the <lb/>
            Boeotians was a grievous affront, and a deliberate provocation, to the <lb/>
            Commander-in-Chief of the foremost Hellenic state. The sacrifice <note type="footnote"> 1 Xen. Hell. iii. 4. 3, 4 ; Plutarch, Agesilaus, chap. 6; Pausanias, Laconica, ix. 2. <lb/>
            The principal victim was a deer, <foreign xml:lang="grc">καταστέψας ἔλαφον έκελευσεν ἀπὰρξασθαι τὸν <lb/>
            ἑαυτοῦ μάντιν</foreign>. Plutarch, ubi supra. </note><note type="footnote"> The deer was in many ways specially associated with Artemis; but on the <lb/>
            present occasion its sacrifice was peculiarly appropriate, because (as the later <lb/>
            legends told the tale) it was a deer, substituted by the Goddess for Iphigenia, that <lb/>
            Agamemnon really sacrificed at Aulis. <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">άλλ' έξέκλεψεν, έλα</foreign>ф<foreign xml:lang="grc">ον άντιδο</foreign>û<foreign xml:lang="grc">σά μου<lb/>

            which was to redound to the glory of Agesilaus was turned into a bitter <lb/>
            humiliation; and he re-embarked on his trireme in great anger, calling <lb/>
            the Gods to witness the insulting conduct of the Boeotians.</p>
          <p>The incident was not forgotten; and when at the commencement of <lb/>
            the year B. C. 395 the Phocians, assailed by the Boeotians, applied for <lb/>
            help to Sparta, the latter1 at once seized the opportunity of declaring <lb/>
            war against Thebes, and summoned the Peloponnesian Confederacy to <lb/>
            invade Boeotia. Only one member of the Confederacy refused to comply, <lb/>
            and of course that member was Corinth 2. The army from Peloponnesus, <lb/>
            led by Pausanias the King, was to invade Boeotia from the south: <lb/>
            whilst another army, under Lysander, the greatest general and most <lb/>
            influential personage in Hellas, was to enter it on the north-west from <lb/>
            Phocis. The two armies were to meet at Haliartus.</p>
          <p>Alarmed at these formidable preparations the Boeotians sent an <lb/>
            embassy to Athens, to propose an alliance, and the formation of an <lb/>
            Anti-Spartan League. The speech of their envoy, as preserved, or <lb/>
            invented, for us by Xenophon, points out in strong and exaggerated <lb/>
            language the benefits which might accrue to Athens herself from the <lb/>
            proposed alliance. "Ye will become," says the orator, "far greater <lb/>
            than ye ever were; ye will be leaders of all: of ourselves, of the <lb/>
            Peloponnesians, of your former subjects, yea of the great king himself."</p>
          <p>The question for the Athenian Assembly to decide was one of vital <lb/>
            and absorbing interest. Should they, or should they not, concur with <lb/>
            Thebes in establishing an Anti-Spartan League, to which Corinth at <lb/>
            all events was quite certain at once to accede? If they did, they <lb/>
            would, for the first time since their fall, be moving out of the shadow <lb/>
            of the Spartan supremacy, and would become once more a free and <lb/>
            independent Republic. But they would be uniting themselves to their <lb/>
            deadliest enemies, against the very Power which, nine years before, had <lb/>
            shielded them from the relentless vengeance of those very enemies. <lb/>
            They would be performing an act of great political ingratitude, and <note type="footnote"> 1 Xen. Bell. iii. 5. 5. </note><note type="footnote">2 Ibid. ii. 5. 17. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="xiv"/>
            at the same time of great political hazard. If Thebes and Corinth <lb/>
            were again to attack them, they had forfeited all claim to be again <lb/>
            protected by Sparta; whilst if Thebes and Corinth were to make peace <lb/>
            with Sparta, they would be wholly unable, in the present state of their <lb/>
            fortifications, to make any show of resistance to the Peloponnesian armies. <lb/>
            It must have been a time for great searchings of heart amongst the <lb/>
            wisest Athenians; and Thrasybulus, then the most eminent leader of <lb/>
            the people, seems to have been seriously perplexed and uncertain which <lb/>
            course it would be more prudent to adopt. For this was doubtless the <lb/>
            occasion on which he first promised the Lacedaemonians to speak in <lb/>
            their favour, and then, changing his mind, excused himself on the <lb/>
            ground of sudden1 indisposition. He does not seem however to have <lb/>
            taken an active part against them. I do not know on what authority <lb/>
            he is represented by Bishop Thirlwall and Mr. Grote as moving the <lb/>
            resolution to accept the Theban proposal, or by Mr. Mitford as <lb/>
            " countenancing the measure." He seems to have done nothing beyond <lb/>
            communicating the resolution, when passed, to the Theban envoys, and <lb/>
            that too in somewhat ungracious terms, showing that he was fully alive <lb/>
            to the perilous character of the step.</p>
          <p>However very many, <foreign xml:lang="grc">πάμπολλοι</foreign>, spoke in favour of the alliance, and <lb/>
            it was ultimately accepted by the Assembly without a dissentient vote. <lb/>
            The Athenian troops at once started for Haliartus, and though the <lb/>
            engagement in which Lysander was defeated and slain took place before <lb/>
            their arrival, yet their subsequent presence had a determining influence <lb/>
            upon the campaign, and compelled the ignominious evacuation of Boeotia, <lb/>
            without a battle, by the army of Pausanias.</p>
          <p>This great and striking event, the "march to Haliartus" as it was <note type="footnote"> 1 See line 356 of this play, and the note there. It must be remembered that <lb/>
            this is not a piece of gossip, retailed by Plutarch or some other anecdote-collector: <lb/>
            it was a statement made before the whole Athenian people within two years after <lb/>
            the event. </note><note type="footnote"> Pausanias (Laconica, ix. 5) says that the Athenians had sent an embassy to <lb/>
            Sparta, urging her to accept arbitration instead of going to war. But this does <lb/>

            commonly called, made a deep and lasting impression upon the Athenian <lb/>
            mind. " For ye, 0 men of Athens," says Demosthenes, some sixty-five <lb/>
            years afterwards, " when the Lacedaemonians were masters of sea and <lb/>
            land, and controlled all countries round about Attica with their har­ <lb/>
            mosts and their garrisons—Euboea, Tanagra, the whole of Boeotia, <lb/>
            Megara, Aegina, Cleonae, the other islands-whilst ye, for your part, <lb/>
            had no ships, and your city no walls, ye marched out to Haliartus, and <lb/>
            not many days afterwards to Corinth: though the Athenians of that <lb/>
            time had much ill to remember against the Corinthians and the Thebans <lb/>
            for their conduct in the Deceleian war; but they remembered it not. <lb/>
            Far from it 1." And the name of Haliartus became so familiarly associated <lb/>
            with the glories of Athens that more than two centuries later when the <lb/>
            Romans, in their war against Perseus, conquered and destroyed the town, <lb/>
            the Athenians preferred a request that the site might be given to them­ <lb/>
            selves. One would infer from Polybius, who speaks of their request <lb/>
            with some indignation, that the petition was refused; but Strabo tells <lb/>
            us that the Romans did in fact give them the site, and that in his time <lb/>
            it was still in their possession.</p>
          <p>Here then we find an alliance which precisely answers to the descrip­ <lb/>
            tion given in the speech of Praxagora. That this was the one chance <lb/>
            for Athens, that its refusal would ruin the city, is just what some, at <lb/>
            least, of the "many orators " who advocated the alliance might reason­ <lb/>
            ably be expected to urge. But Praxagora goes on to say that, when <lb/>
            the Athenians had got the Alliance, they became disgusted with it. Can <lb/>
            this be truly said of the Anti-Spartan League within two years of its <lb/>
            inception, that is to say in the spring of B. c. 393 ? About this there <lb/>
            is no doubt whatever. <note type="footnote"> 1 De Coronâ, 118. </note><note type="footnote"> Mantitheus, in the sixteenth oration of Lysias, says that when the Athenians <lb/>
            made the treaty with the Boeotians and marched to Haliartus (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ὄτε τὴν συμμαχίαν <lb/>
            ἐποιήσασθε πρὸς τοὺς Βοιωτοὺς, καὶ εἰς 'Αλίαρτν ἔδει ϐοηθεῖν</foreign>) it was thought that the <lb/>
            hoplites were undertaking a service of great danger, but that the cavalry would <lb/>
            run but little risk. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 xxx. 18. </note><note type="footnote">3 ix. § SO. </note></p><pb n="xvi"/>
            
          <p>At first, indeed, everything seemed to promise well. The League was <lb/>
            joined at once by the Corinthians and the Argives, and shortly afterwards <lb/>
            by the Euboeans, the Acarnanians, the Leucadians, and other states1. <lb/>
            The Spartan garrisons and alliances beyond Boeotia were swept away, <lb/>
            and the Phocians completely defeated. And when in the following spring <lb/>
            and summer (B. C. 394) a large 2 army, composed of contingents from all <lb/>
            the members of the League, was gathered together at Corinth, the <lb/>
            confidence of the leaders was unbounded. Timolaus of Corinth proposed <lb/>
            an immediate march on Sparta: for rivers, said he, are smallest at their <lb/>
            source, before they become swoln by the influx of their tributaries, and <lb/>
            wasps are most easily destroyed in their nests. Doubtless too there <lb/>
            was another reason, the hope of concluding the war off-hand before <lb/>
            Agesilaus could return from Asia Minor. The proposal of Timolaus was <lb/>
            adopted, and the army, leaving its great camp near Corinth, marched <lb/>
            southward as far as the famous valley of Nemea. But they had under­ <lb/>
            rated the military spirit and the military resources of their opponent. <lb/>
            Instead of attacking Sparta at home, they were forced to retrace their <lb/>
            steps to repel an attack by Sparta on their own headquarters. A Pelo­ <lb/>
            ponnesian army, nearly as large as their own, had marched through Sicyon, <lb/>
            and was ravaging with sword and fire (<foreign xml:lang="grc">τέμνοντες καὶ κάοντες τὴν χώραν</foreign>) <lb/>
            the territory of Corinth. The battle between these two mighty Hellenic <lb/>
            armies, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἡ μεγάλη μάχη πρὸς Αακεδαιμονίους, ἡ ἐν Κορίνθῳ</foreign>, as 3 Demosthenes <lb/>
            describes it, resulted in the total rout of the army of the League, and the <note type="footnote"> 1 Diodorus, xiv. 82. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 "The fighting men of all descriptions," says Mr. Mitford, "must have amounted <lb/>
            to 50,000." This seems a fair computation. The hoplites alone, Xenophon tells <lb/>
            us, numbered 24,000; viz. 7,000 Argives, 6,000 Athenians, 5,000 Boeotians, 3,000 <lb/>
            Corinthians, and 8,000 Euboeans, iv. 2. 17. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 Adv. Leptinem 59. It seems probable that between eighty and a hundred <lb/>
            thousand men were engaged in the conflict: a fighting force which, had it <lb/>
            combined, might have overthrown all the armies of Persia. Such was doubtless <lb/>
            the reflection of Agesilaus when be heard of the great battle, and not, as <lb/>
            Xenophon (Ages. vii. 5) reports him to have said, that those slain in the conflict <lb/>
            would have been adequate to the task, which would hare been an absurd <lb/>
            exaggeration. Later writers merely copy Xenophon. </note> <lb/>

            main body of the 1Athenian troops, assailed at once in front and on <lb/>
            their left flank by the Lacedaemonians, suffered more severely than any <lb/>
            other contingent. The defeated army fled for safety to the walls of <lb/>
            Corinth, but the Lacedaemonians were following hard after them; the <lb/>
            gates were shut in their faces, and the fugitives were compelled to take <lb/>
            refuge in the neighbouring2 camp from which they had issued, only <lb/>
            a few days earlier, in the confident expectation of a victorious march <lb/>
            upon Sparta.</p>
          <p>The battle of Corinth was fought in the summer of B. c. 394; and its <lb/>
            result made it evident that, even in the absence of the army of Agesilaus, <lb/>
            Sparta was more than a match for the Anti-Spartan League. And <lb/>
            before that summer had passed away, Agesilaus returning from Asia, and <lb/>
            having traversed Thrace, Macedonia, and Thessaly, entered Boeotia from <lb/>
            the north, and inflicted another defeat on the army of the League in the <note type="footnote"> ' Xen. Hell. iv. 2. 21. "We lost good men at Corinth," says Plato <lb/>
            (Menexenus 17), who is supposed to have taken part in the battle; Aelian, H. V. <lb/>
            rii. 14, Aristoxenus cited by Diog. Laert. (Plato, segm. 8.) The statement is probable <lb/>
            enough ; but the witnesses are not above suspicion; since Aelian says that he was <lb/>
            also present at the battle of Tanagra, and Aristoxenus that he was present at the <lb/>
            battles of Tanagra and Delium. Now these three battles, Tanagra, Delium, and <lb/>
            Corinth, are all incidentally mentioned in the Dialogues of Plato; but of course <lb/>
            he could not have been present at Tanagra or Delium. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐς τὸ ἀρχαῖον οτρατόπεδον</foreign>, Xen. Hell. iv. 2. 23. Not "the position which they <lb/>

            the fugitives the whole Peloponnesian army was interposed. The " original" or <lb/>
            " ancient" camp, was the great camp outside the walls of Corinth, which had <lb/>
            been occupied for many months, first by the Athenians. Boeotians, Corinthians, <lb/>
            and Argives alone; then, also by the contingents from the other states as they <lb/>
            severally arrived; and finally, by the entire army whilst the Council of War <lb/>
            was in session, and during the period which intervened before the march south­ <lb/>

            defeated troops had taken refuge in the neighbouring camp, some of them, <lb/>

            battle of Coronea. Here again1 an Athenian contingent formed part of <lb/>
            the defeated army; but we have no mention made of its losses, and <lb/>
            probably they were slight compared with those sustained in the battle of <lb/>
            Corinth.</p>
          <p>Thus within a few weeks 2 the entire aspect of affairs had, as regarded <lb/>
            Athens, undergone a serious change for the worse. She had lost many <lb/>
            citizens without any beneficial results; the whole force of the League <lb/>
            had been defeated both in the north and in the south; the bright hopes <lb/>
            with which the year B. c. 394 had commenced, had altogether died away; <lb/>
            divided counsels were already making themselves felt at Corinth, and it <lb/>
            was but natural that the Athenians should become disgusted, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἤχθοντο</foreign>, at <lb/>
            the failure of all those brilliant expectations, through which they had <lb/>
            been induced, less than two years before, to take so active a part in the <lb/>
            formation of the Anti-Spartan League.</p>
          <p>It was at this juncture, at the commencement of the year B. c. 393, <lb/>
            that Praxagora comes forward, in the play before us, to condemn the <lb/>
            vacillating policy of the men, and to propose that the government of <lb/>
            Athens shall be henceforth entrusted to the women, as the more stable <lb/>
            and conservative sex. But before we discuss her proposals, there are two <lb/>
            other points to be mentioned.</p>
          <p>We have already seen that, according to the Scholiast, the orator who <lb/>
            persuaded the Athenians to contract the alliance with Thebes, and was, <lb/>
            in consequence, obliged to leave the country, was none other than Conon ; <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">Κόνωνα λέγει</foreign>, is his comment on line 196. This, of course, is a mere <note type="footnote"> 1 Lysias, pro Mantitheo. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 We can fix these dates with a precision generally unattainable owing to the <lb/>
            fact that an eclipse of the sun took place shortly after the battle of Corinth and <lb/>
            immediately before the battle of Coronea. Agesilaus was at this time hastening <lb/>
            from the Hellespont to Boeotia. The news of the victory at Corinth met him at <lb/>
            Amphipolis (Xen. Hell. iv. 3. 1), when he had passed through Thrace and a part <lb/>
            of Macedonia. The eclipse, which is calculated to have occurred on August 14, <lb/>
            B.C. 894, took- place after he had passed through the rest of Macedonia and <lb/>
            Thessaly, and had entered Boeotia; indeed, just as the skirmishing began which <lb/>
            was the prelude to the battle of Coronea. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="xix"/>
            delusion. Conon had never set foot in Athens since the disaster at <lb/>
            Aegospotami; Aristophanes would not have described that gallant officer <lb/>
            simply as one <foreign xml:lang="grc">τῶν ῥητόρων</foreign>; nor did he ever fall into discredit with the <lb/>
            Athenian people. Why then, it may be asked, was his name so intimately <lb/>
            connected, in the mind of the Scholiast, with the Anti-Spartan League ? <lb/>
            It was because, whatever benefit accrued to Athens from the League, she <lb/>
            derived through the intervention of Conon. Already, before the com­ <lb/>
            mencement of B. c. 393, whilst the horizon was so dark and threatening <lb/>
            at home, it was known that he had won a great victory over the Lacedae­ <lb/>
            monian fleet at Cnidus, a victory which was speedily followed by the <lb/>
            downfall of the Lacedaemonian power in the islands and beyond the <lb/>
            sea. This victory, however, was not won for Athens; it was achieved <lb/>
            by the Persian fleet, consisting of Greek and Phoenician triremes, under <lb/>
            the joint command of Conon and Pharnabazus ; and the isles of Greece <lb/>
            and cities of Asia Minor delivered from the Spartan harmosts and <lb/>
            garrisons were not handed over to Athens, but were left as free and <lb/>
            independent states. But before another year had rolled away, before the <lb/>
            spring of B. c. 392 had arrived, a brilliant and marvellous change, on--­ <lb/>
            might almost say a resurrection, had taken place in the affairs of Athens. <lb/>
            Conon had returned, bringing the Persian fleet, and an ample supply of <lb/>
            Persian gold to secure her safety; the other members of the League had <lb/>
            readily assisted, Thebes alone sending 500 skilled workmen; the Long <lb/>
            Walls had risen again, the fortifications of Peiraeus were restored, and <lb/>
            Athens was entirely delivered from the doubts and the dangers which <lb/>
            had so long beset her. At the commencement of B. c. 393 Athens was <lb/>
            in a state of disquiet and perplexity, still halting between two courses. <lb/>
            There was no doubt or wavering at the commencement of B. c. 392. Her <lb/>
            safety was assured. She had been finally launched on a new career of <lb/>
            prosperity.</p>
          <p>The foregoing considerations might of themselves be sufficient to show <lb/>
            that Petit and Mr. Fynes Clinton, in giving B. c. 392 as the date of the <lb/>
            Ecelesiazusae, have fixed it a year too late. The deservedly high reputa­ <note type="footnote"> b a </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="xx"/>
            tion of Mr. Fynes Clinton in chronological questions has obtained universal <lb/>
            acceptance for that date, although the speech of Praxagora, from begin­ <lb/>
            ning to end, cries out against it, and demands the previous year. And <lb/>
            clear as the internal evidence is in favour of B. C. 393, the external <lb/>
            evidence is almost equally clear. The subjoined table of the years of the <lb/>
            96th Olympiad may assist us in an examination of the grounds on which <lb/>
            those two distinguished chronologers have come to a wrong conclusion : <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BELL_67_fig3.jpg"/></figure> <lb/>
              The question is whether the Ecclesiazusae was exhibited in the archonship <lb/>
              of Eubulides, or in that of Demostratus. And this to a great extent <lb/>
              depends upon another question, viz. whether <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸ συμμαχικὸν</foreign>, which is said <lb/>
              to have been concluded two years before its exhibition, was concluded in <lb/>
              the archonship of Phormio, or in that of Diophantus.</p>
          <p>Now Petit (to consider his theory first) fixes on the wrong <foreign xml:lang="grc">συμμαχία</foreign>. <lb/>
            He treats the <foreign xml:lang="grc">συμμαχία</foreign>, to which Praxagora refers, as being not the <lb/>
            original Anti-Spartan League, but the subsequent accession to the League <lb/>
            of Corinth and Argolis. And true it is that Diodorus, who has spoken of <lb/>
            the original Anti-Spartan League and the march to Haliartus in the <lb/>
            81st chapter of his XIVth Book, does, when he returns to the subject <lb/>
            in the following chapter, speak of an alliance being made, during the <lb/>
            archonship of Diophantus, between the Athenians, Boeotians, Corinthians, <lb/>
            and Argives. But it is impossible that these accessions to the League can <lb/>
            have been the alliance of which Praxagora speaks. They were contem­ <lb/>
            plated from the first; to them no opposition was possible; no orator was <lb/>
            required to push them through; no one could have argued that the <lb/>
            rejection of these new members would ruin the state, for the idea of <lb/>
            rejecting them could not have occurred to anybody; nor were the <lb/>
            Athenians afterwards vexed (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἤχθονοτο</foreign>) at having admitted them. In no <lb/>
            one point does Petit's <foreign xml:lang="grc">συμμαχία</foreign> answer to Praxagora's <foreign xml:lang="grc">συμμαχικόν</foreign>. This <lb/>
             <pb n="xxi"/>
            mistake as to the alliance is the sole foundation for Petit's date of the <lb/>
            play, and the foundation being removed the superstructure falls.</p>
          <p>Mr. Fynes Clinton of course avoids the error into which Petit, and <lb/>
            after him Paulmier, fell. He recognizes that by the alliance Praxagora <lb/>
            must mean the original Anti-Spartan League and the march to Haliartus, <lb/>
            but he places these events a year too late, viz. in the archonship of <lb/>
            Diophantus. His sole authority is an observation of Plutarch 1 that an <lb/>
            oracle was thought to refer to the two battles of Delium and Haliartus, <lb/>
            the latter <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὔστερον ἔτει τριακοστῷ γενομένην</foreign> than the former. But <lb/>
            Plutarch's authority on a matter of chronology is of very slight value; <lb/>
            and Mr. Fynes Clinton seems to have overlooked the express statement <lb/>
            of Diodorus2 that the formation of the Anti-Spartan League and the <lb/>
            march to Haliartus took place during the archonship of Phormio. Diodorus <lb/>
            arranges his facts in the form of annals, prefixing (in this part of his <lb/>
            history) to the events of each successive year the names of the Athenian <lb/>
            archon and the Roman consuls for that particular year. And his positive <lb/>
            statement as to the date of an event very greatly outweighs an incidental <lb/>
            remark of Plutarch. And here it is in entire accord with the conviction <lb/>
            which must be borne in upon the mind of every thoughtful reader, from <lb/>
            a careful perusal of the arguments and allegations of Praxagora.</p>
          <p>It seems therefore on every ground absolutely certain, that the play <lb/>
            was exhibited in February or March, B. C. 393, after the reverses <lb/>
            sustained by the Anti-Spartan League, and before the arrival of Conon, <lb/>
            and the rebuilding of the Long Walls of Athens.</p>
          <p>Reverting now to Praxagora and her scheme for the future govern­ <lb/>
            ment of Athens, we find that the main argument put forward in support <lb/>
            of her proposed <foreign xml:lang="grc">γυναικοκρατία</foreign> is based on the more conservative character <lb/>
            of the female sex. lien, she says, are always in quest of novelty and <lb/>
            cliange. Women abide by their principles, and the women of the present <lb/>
            day use the same customs and follow the same practices that their <lb/>
            predecessors have used and followed throughout all generations. Athens, <note type="footnote"> 1 Plutarch, Lysander, chap. 29. </note><note type="footnote">2 Diodorus, xiv. 54, 81, 82. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="xxii"/>
            imperilled by the restlessness of men, will be saved by the steadfast and <lb/>
            sober adherence of women to ancient methods and venerable traditions. <lb/>
            Yet no sooner does Praxagora by these arguments and for these purposes <lb/>
            obtain the reins of power, than she spontaneously develops a scheme so <lb/>
            startling and so novel, as to throw altogether into the shade the wildest <lb/>
            extravagances of the men. It is a scheme of naked socialism, involving <lb/>
            the community of goods, the abolition of marriage, and (what is one­ <lb/>
            sidedly called) the community of women.</p>
          <p>How can we account for this singular phenomenon? It has no <lb/>
            parallel in any other comedy of Aristophanes. The Chorus indeed will <lb/>
            frequently go over to the side which it began by opposing, and some­ <lb/>
            times one of the principal characters will yield to argument, or the <lb/>
            stress of circumstances: but there is always enough in the play itself <lb/>
            to determine and explain the change. Here, however, the heroine, who <lb/>
            has been earnestly seeking power for one purpose, immediately employs <lb/>
            it for the opposite purpose: her special mission being to put a stop to all <lb/>
            political novelties, she at once introduces a political novelty so vast and <lb/>
            revolutionary, that she doubts if the men can be brought to accept it. <lb/>
            And there is not a syllable in the play to justify or account for her <lb/>
            sudden change. It is therefore necessary to look for the determining <lb/>
            cause in something outside the play itself.</p>
          <p>And it seems impossible to doubt that the cause is to be found in the <lb/>
            appearance, whilst Aristophanes was engaged on the Ecclesiazusae, of <lb/>
            the Republic of Plato, or at all events of that part of the work which <lb/>
            now constitutes Books II to V (inclusive)1 of the Republic. After the <note type="footnote"> 1 The Republic of Plato purports to be the narration, by Socrates, of a conversation <lb/>
            which had taken place on the preceding day. The Timaeus purports to be a <lb/>
            conversation which took place on the day after the narration. And at its <lb/>
            commencement Socrates, in response to an appeal by Timaeus, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐξ ἀρχῆς διὰ <lb/>
            βραχέων πάλιν ἐπάνελθε αἰτὰ</foreign>, briefly recapitulates what he had said the day before, <lb/>
            or in other words gives a short summary of the contents of the Republic. When <lb/>
            he has done, he asks Timaeus whether anything has been omitted which should <lb/>
            have been mentioned, and Timaeus replies in the negative. Yet Socrates has <lb/>
            merely recapitulated the contents of Books II to V : whence many have concluded </note> <lb/>

            death of Socrates, an event which occurred in June, B.C. 399, Plato, <lb/>
            we are told1, retired to Megara, then travelled to some other well- <lb/>
            known philosophic centres, Cyrene, Italy, and Egypt, and was con­ <lb/>
            templating a visit to the Magians, but finally, <foreign xml:lang="grc">διὰ τοὺς τῆς 'Ασίος <lb/>
            πολέμους</foreign>, gave up the idea, and returned to Athens. If by <foreign xml:lang="grc">τοὺς τῆς <lb/>
            'Ασίας πολέμους</foreign> we are to understand, as seems unquestionable, the <lb/>
            expeditions of Dercyllidas and Agesilaus (which would naturally render <lb/>
            it unsafe for an Hellenic citizen to journey into the interior of the <lb/>
            Persian empire), Plato must have returned to Athens a year or two <lb/>
            before the date of the present play. And this would be in accordance <lb/>
            with the tradition that he took part in the battle of Corinth, B. c. 394, <lb/>
            though, as we have already seen, the tradition itself rests on no very <lb/>
            certain foundation. But, however this may be, it is clear that his <lb/>
            Republic, either in its present, or in an incomplete, shape came into <lb/>
            the hands of the Athenian people before the termination of that year.</p>
          <p>Praxagora, therefore, having obtained supreme power at Athens, with, <lb/>
            apparently, authority to remodel its institutions at her will, suddenly <lb/>
            finds, all ready to her hand, as a delightful subject for caricature, the <lb/>
            elaborate communistic schemes developed with such detail in this new <lb/>
            philosophical treatise. Aristophanes was not the man to let such an <lb/>
            opportunity escape him. What mattered Praxagora's consistency com­ <lb/>
            pared with this brilliant opening for philosophic chaff? And so the <lb/>
            greatest novelty of all, a system of undiluted communism, is at once <lb/>
            introduced, by the opponent of all novelty, into the practical everyday <lb/>
            life of the people of Athens. Plato had foreseen that these theories <lb/>
            were likely to attract the ridicule of the wits, ra <foreign xml:lang="grc">τῶν χαριέντων σκώμ­ <lb/>
            ματα</foreign>, and though he could not have anticipated the form which that <lb/>
            ridicule would take, yet the epigram prefixed to this Introduction shows <note type="footnote"> that the Republic, as originally composed, consisted of those four books only, and <lb/>
            was expanded by Plato to its present size at a subsequent period. The question <lb/>
            does not concern our present inquiry; since the theories caricatured by Aria­ <lb/>
            tophanes would anyhow have formed part of the original work. </note><note type="footnote"> 1 Diogenes Laertius. (Plato, segm. 6, 7.) </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="xxiv"/>
            that he Lore the poet no malice for the humorous and impersonal <lb/>
            caricature.</p>
          <p>It seems strange that any one should ever have doubted or ignored <lb/>
            the very obvious fact that in the latter half of the Ecclesiazusae, <lb/>
            Aristophanes is laughing at the communistic theories of the Platonic <lb/>
            Republic. Many similarities of thought and diction between the <lb/>
            Praxagorean and Platonic schemes will be found pointed out in the <lb/>
            Commentary : and it really is quite inconceivable1 that two writers, <lb/>
            one a philosopher and one a comic poet, approaching the subject from <lb/>
            such different points of views, should, independently of each other, by <lb/>
            a mere fortuitous coincidence, have travelled over so exactly the same <lb/>
            ground in (allowing for the grave purpose of the one and the comic <lb/>
            purpose of the other) so exactly the same way. It will be sufficient <lb/>
            here to consider a single instance. In both systems, though for widely <lb/>
            different reasons, children will be unable to recognize their parents, and <lb/>
            parents their children. In both cases this fact is only brought out in <lb/>
            answer to a question. In both cases the question is propounded in the <lb/>
            same form, not Will they recognize? but How will they recognize? (<foreign xml:lang="grc">πῶς <lb/>
            διαγνώσονται</foreign>, Plato; <foreign xml:lang="grc">πῶς δυνατὸς ἔστ</foreign>at <foreign xml:lang="grc">διαγιγνώσκειν</foreign>, Aristophanes) the <lb/>
            answer being, of course, that no recognition is possible; all youths <lb/>
            must consider themselves the children of all the old people. Out of <lb/>
            this novel state of things a variety of strange and startling results <lb/>
            might arise; but in both cases one, and one only, and that by no <lb/>
            means the most obvious, is selected, viz. the greater security of the <lb/>
            old people. For now, if a youth should assault (<foreign xml:lang="grc">τύπτῃ</foreign>, Plato, Aristo­ <lb/>
            phanes) his elder, the bystanders would at once interfere; since, for all <lb/>
            they can tell, they may themselves be the children (Plato adds "or the <lb/>
            brothers or the parents ") of the sufferer. Is the identity of this peculiar <note type="footnote"> 1 "Vix negari a quoquam poterit, Ecclesiazusarum quam scripsit comicus <lb/>

            train of thought, couched, as it is, in such similar phraseology, merely <lb/>
            the result of an accident? Credat Judaeus Apella. Non ego.</p>
          <p>Still a caricature, by its very nature, cannot be a fair representation <lb/>
            of the thing caricatured: and no one would gather from Praxagora's <lb/>
            wild proposals any notion of the real tone and spirit of the great <lb/>
            philosophers dream. Let us briefly touch upon some of the more <lb/>
            salient points of difference between the two schemes.</p>
          <p>And in the first place, the Platonic communism did not extend to <lb/>
            the population at large, it was entirely confined to the <foreign xml:lang="grc">φύλακες</foreign>, or <lb/>
            guardians of the state. These were a specially selected class of (say) <lb/>
            1,000 persons, of whom the elder and wiser were to be the governors, <lb/>
            and the remainder the military protectors of the New Republic. And <lb/>
            the question which Plato set himself to solve was how he could best <lb/>
            ensure that these guardians should faithfully fulfil the high duties <lb/>
            assigned them, and not themselves become a danger to the citizens <lb/>
            they were intended to protect. Plato knew no better way, and probably <lb/>
            there was no better way, of achieving this end, than to detach them as <lb/>
            far as possible not only from all human frailty and all human passion, <lb/>
            but even from all human sympathies and associations however innocent <lb/>
            in themselves. Every detail of their training and education is elaborated <lb/>
            by Plato with extraordinary care. From their earliest infancy they <lb/>
            were to be surrounded by no influences other than those of beauty and <lb/>
            goodness, and to be anxiously preserved " from all evil thoughts which <lb/>
            may assault and hurt the soul." And when they were grown up, and <lb/>
            enrolled among the actual guardians, they were to stand in the position <lb/>
            of the Christian knights of former times, who had taken upon them­ <lb/>
            selves the vow of poverty. They were to renounce all private property, <lb/>
            and the ties of a separate family and home: they were to live in <lb/>
            common, and have all things in common. And thus, it was hoped, <lb/>
            they would be free from all private interests and predilections, and be <lb/>
            qualified to carry out with a single mind the duties which they were <lb/>
            selected to perform.</p>
          <p>This then is the first great distinction between the system of Praxa­ <lb/>
             <pb n="xxvi"/>
            gora and the system of Plato. The former applied to all the citizens <lb/>
            for their own enjoyment; the latter only to a special class for the <lb/>
            purpose of enabling them to fulfil more efficiently their special duties <lb/>
            towards the state.</p>
          <p>And secondly even as regards this special class of guardians, there was <lb/>
            nothing, until its members had passed their prime (which Plato limits <lb/>
            to the age of fifty-five for a man, and of forty for a woman), in any <lb/>
            way resembling that promiscuous intercourse between the sexes which <lb/>
            formed so prominent a feature in the system of Praxagora. On the <lb/>
            contrary, until that limit of age was reached 1, no intercourse whatever <lb/>
            was permitted excepting under the sanction of marriage, a marriage <lb/>
            solemnized amid sacrifices and choral hymns, and invested with all <lb/>
            possible sanctity. It is true that the marriage was merely a temporary <lb/>
            one; the pairs were brought together for marriage by a professed <lb/>
            sortition, secretly overruled, if necessary, by the judgement of the <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἄρχοντες</foreign>, and on the next solemn marriage-sortition, the husband and <lb/>
            wife would in all probability find themselves assorted with, and married <lb/>
            to, different partners. But however unsatisfactory2 were the marriage <figure type="illustration">

              this seems forgotten in the following chapter (461). </note><note type="footnote"> 2 The breaking up of the family relationship is, at all events to Christian minds, <lb/>
              " the great blot in the Republic. True it is that Plato throws out his theory of <lb/>
              marriage as a mere theory, not as either possible or expedient to be realized. <lb/>
              True that in the circumstances of his days, in the hopeless irredeemable corruption <lb/>
              of family life in Athens, he could scarcely trace the form of that high instrument <lb/>
              in the hand of God, by which man is to be first reared into life, both in his body <lb/>
              and his mind. True also that he would not destroy the instincts and affections of <lb/>
              nature, but only multiply and transfer them, so that the whole state should be one <lb/>
              family 'of fathers, children, and brothers'; as Christianity has realized the wish <lb/>
              literally in all its parts, but by a spiritual marriage, and a spiritual regeneration. <lb/>
              And true that his end was noble-to bind together the whole body in one, to <lb/>
              extinguish all selfish affections, perhaps also even to purify and chasten (though <lb/>
              the hope were- vain), assuredly not to give a licence to man's worst and lowest <lb/>
              passions. But granting all this and more, Plato forgot the family-he set aside <lb/>
              the institution of nature, though only in idea, and has ever since paid the penalty </note> <lb/>

              laws of the Platonic Republic, however strangely they ignored the <lb/>
              family, the true unit on which society is based, they were designed <lb/>
              not to gratify, but to eradicate, all evil concupiscence and lust; to <lb/>
              suppress all private desires and inclinations; to subordinate the feelings <lb/>
              of the individual to the interests of the state. They were as far <lb/>
              removed, as the east is from the west, from the universal licence <lb/>
              accorded by the system of Praxagora. The guardians were to act, in <lb/>
              all things, not as they themselves desired, but as the state prescribed.</p>
          <p>It If somebody were to object," asks Adeimantus, when Socrates has <lb/>
            unfolded his views on this topic, It that you are not giving your <lb/>
            guardians a very happy life, what would you say to that?" "I should <lb/>
            say," replies Socrates, It that it would not surprise me, if they were <lb/>
            to be the happiest people in the world: but that however this may be, <lb/>
            it is with a view not to the pre-eminent happiness of one particular class, <lb/>
            but to the common happiness of the entire state, that we are building <lb/>
            up our Republic."</p>
          <p>And, thirdly, it must never be forgotten that the Republic of Plato <lb/>
            was avowedly an unattainable 1 ideal: a heavenly vision, to be cherished <lb/>
            indeed in the soul as a counsel of perfection, but quite impracticable <lb/>
            in the grosser atmosphere of the earth and amidst the sordid passions <lb/>
            of mankind.</p>
          <p>"You are speaking," says Glaucon to Socrates, at the close of the <lb/>
            Ninth Book, "you are speaking of that Republic which we have just <lb/>
            been creating, a Republic which exists indeed in theory, but which has <lb/>
            no local habitation, I imagine, in any region of this earth." " But in <lb/>
            heaven perchance," rejoins the Master, "a pattern is laid up for him <lb/>
            that will see, and seeing will enrol himself a citizen therein. But <lb/>

            we need not concern ourselves; for be it real or be it not, by its maxims <lb/>

            I readily assent," says Glaucon.</p>
          <p>Even in the philosophic pages of the Republic these topics cannot be <lb/>
            discussed without the introduction of much that is distasteful to a <lb/>
            delicate mind, and this drawback is greatly increased when the subject <lb/>
            is transferred to the comic stage. The old Attic Comedy was the direct <lb/>
            outcome of the phallic1 songs, which were sung, as part of a religious <lb/>
            ceremony, at the festivals of Dionysus; and an Athenian audience <lb/>
            would never permit it to forget its origin, or to use other than the <lb/>
            broadest and most plain-spoken language with regard to the relations <lb/>
            of the sexes, and other matters on which we are happily now more <lb/>
            reticent. Twice 2 at least, in the Clouds and in the Birds, Aristophanes <lb/>
            endeavoured to lift the comic art into an altogether different atmosphere; <lb/>
            but in each case, although to modern taste these are amongst the most <lb/>
            brilliant and successful of his efforts, the play was refused the prize. <lb/>
            The Athenians could not have objected to the Ecclesiazusae on that <lb/>
            score ; and it seemed at first that there must be so many and such <lb/>
            considerable gaps In the translation, including the omission of an entire <lb/>
            scene, that it would have, like the translations of the Lysistrata and <lb/>
            the Thesmophoriazusae, to folloto the Greek text, instead of appearing <lb/>
            on the opposite page. Consequently various liberties were taken in the <lb/>
            translation; some lines were omitted, and others inserted; it was not <lb/>
            thought necessary to preserve with such accuracy as in other cases the <lb/>
            exact meaning of the original; and, above all, the long Aristophanic <lb/>
            lines, the special favourites of the poet, were unworthily represented <note type="footnote"> 1 Aristotle's Poetics, iv. 15. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 We have seen too, in the Introduction and Commentary on the Wasps, that <lb/>
            the original scheme of that comedy seems to have been equally free from all <lb/>
            phallic associations, and that it was only after the defeat of the Clouds that <lb/>
            its author introduced into it certain scenes of broad humour which do not coalesce <lb/>
            with the rest of the play, but without which, possibly, the Wasps also would have <lb/>
            failed in the theatrical competition. </note> <lb/>

            by mere anapaestic dimeters. However the only other1 translation <lb/>
            in English verse of which I am aware gives the play in its entirety; <lb/>
            and ultimately, after much hesitation, it seemed possible to follow that <lb/>
            example without giving any just cause of offence. And, indeed, the <lb/>
            coarsest passages of Aristophanes are mere comic buffoonery, enacted <lb/>
            in the open air, not by actors and actresses before a mixed audience of <lb/>
            men and women, but by men only before the male population of Athens, <lb/>
            no woman being present. They are broad and plain-spoken, but never <lb/>
            morbid and seductive, and could not be injurious to anybody, who did <lb/>
            not come to their study with a mind already corrupted and debased.</p>
          <p>As regards the observation just made that, at all events in the time of <lb/>
            Aristophanes, no women were present at the performance of a comedy; <lb/>
            it may be permissible to conclude this Introduction with a more minute <lb/>
            examination of that question than it has hitherto received. And this <lb/>
            seems the more desirable because a very able scholar, Mr. A. E. Haigh, <lb/>
            in his most instructive and agreeable work " On the Attic Theatre," has <lb/>
            recently expressed a contrary opinion.</p>
          <p>That the solution of the question is to be found, if anywhere, in the <lb/>
            hints afforded by the comedies of Aristophanes appears to be universally <lb/>
            acknowledged. It is certain that the indecorum of the comic stage would <lb/>
            not have deterred Athenian women from attending its representations. <lb/>
            An Athenian maid or matron, walking through the streets of her own <lb/>
            city, could not choose but witness on every side, and indeed at every door, <note type="footnote"> 1 .. The Ecclesiazusae or Female Parliament. Translated from Aristophanes, by <lb/>

            had been already written) in the eighty-seventh year of his age, and an obituary <lb/>
            notice of him appeared in the Times newspaper on the 25th of that month. <lb/>
            After having held for some years the rectory of listen, Pembrokeshire, and that <lb/>
            of Nazing, Essex, he was preferred in 1871 by Lord Chancellor Hatherley to the <lb/>
            rectory of Swyncombe near Henley on Thames which he resigned shortly before <lb/>
            his death. He was a High Churchman and the author of several theological works. <lb/>

            signs and symbols of (to Christian minds) " unspeakable pollution." The <lb/>
            pure and honourable maiden, who obtained the coveted distinction of <lb/>
            bearing the Holy Basket in the procession at the Dionysia, walked <lb/>
            through the admiring crowds accompanied by symbols and songs of, <lb/>
            what we should consider, the most appalling immodesty. Yet to them­ <lb/>
            selves the question of decency or indecency would not even occur. It <lb/>
            was their traditional religion; it was " the very orthodoxy of the myriads <lb/>
            who had lived and died" in the city. And we know that ladies of all <lb/>
            sorts and conditions attended the Roman Mimes 2, which had more than <lb/>
            all the grossness, without the counterbalancing radiancy and patriotic <lb/>
            elevation, of Athenian comedy. In discussing therefore the question <lb/>
            before us the character of the entertainment is not a factor that requires <lb/>
            to be taken into consideration. Nor must we be influenced in the opposite <lb/>
            direction by the circumstance that in later times dramatic performances <lb/>
            were regularly attended by men and women together; for the old Attic <lb/>
            comedy was part of a religious festival, and in religious observances <lb/>
            nothing was more common than the separation of the sexes. We must, <lb/>
            therefore, approach the question without any a priori prejudice on the <lb/>
            one side or on the other, and merely consider what Aristophanes tells us <lb/>
            with regard to the composition of his audience.</p>
          <p>And twice, at least, he appears to enumerate the various classes of <lb/>
            which the audience was composed.</p>
          <p>In Peace 50-53 an actor is desirous of putting the audience in posses­ <lb/>
            sion of the state of affairs at the commencement of the action; and he <lb/>
            says, I will tell it to the loys, and to the mall men, and to the men, and to <lb/>
            the most exalted men, and to the most overweeningly exalted men. He <lb/>
            mentions males of every sort and condition, but he makes no allusion to <lb/>
            women. See also lines 765, 766 of the same play.</p>
          <p>Just so in the play before us, 1141, 1144-1146, Praxagora's waiting- <note type="footnote"> 1 See the account of the Rural Dionysia in Achamians 241-279. The quotations <lb/>

            given in the tenth chapter of that tale, is equally applicable to Athens. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Ovid, Tristia, ii. 497. </note> <lb/>

            maid invites to the banquet all such of the audience as are well disposed <lb/>
            to the play, <foreign xml:lang="grc">τῶνθεατῶν</foreign>V <foreign xml:lang="grc">εἴ τις εὔνους τυγχάνει</foreign>. Her master will not hear <lb/>
            of any exceptions, and says, Why not invite them all and omit nobody, <foreign xml:lang="grc">καὶ <lb/>
            μὴπαραλείψεις μηδένα</foreign> ? Why not freely ask old man, youth, and boy ? <lb/>
            All the audience are to be invited, but again there is no mention of <lb/>
            women.</p>
          <p>There are two other passages in the Ecclesiazusae which have some <lb/>
            bearing on the subject. In lines 435-441, Chremes is telling Blepyrus <lb/>
            that in the assembly a speaker (who was in reality Praxagora the wife <lb/>
            of Blepyrus) had been saying everything in dispraise of men, and every­ <lb/>
            thing in praise of women. "She called you," says he, " a rascal, a thief, <lb/>
            a common informer !" " What, me only ?" asks Blepyrus. " You and the <lb/>
            crowd there," <foreign xml:lang="grc">τωνδὶ</foreign> To <foreign xml:lang="grc">πλῆθος</foreign>, explains Chremes. "' But the woman,' said <lb/>
            the speaker, ' was a wit-fraught thing,' &amp;c." That by <foreign xml:lang="grc">τωνδὶ τὸ πλῆθος</foreign> we <lb/>
            are to understand the audience, is universally admitted, and is, indeed, <lb/>
            obvious. Yet they are all treated as men, and all contrasted with women.</p>
          <p>In the rehearsal at the beginning of the play, one of the speakers, <lb/>
            addressing the audience in the theatre as if they were the assembly in <lb/>
            the Agora, commences her speech by saying, It seems to me, 0 women <lb/>
            sitting there. Praxagora at once interrupts her, What in the world makes <lb/>
            you call them women, when they are men ? Oh, says the other, it was all <lb/>
            along of Epigonus there (pointing to an effeminate citizen); glancing his <lb/>
            way, I really thought that I was speaking to women. Eccl. 165-168. There <lb/>
            would have been no point in this sally if she was actually speaking to <lb/>
            women as well as to men. Epigonus was doubtless the most womanlike <lb/>
            object in the theatre then, as Cleisthenes had been thirty years before, at <lb/>
            the time of the representation of the Clouds. There the Clouds are <lb/>
            described as changing their form and figure in accordance with the objects <lb/>
            they behold. Many instances are given. Yesterday they saw Cleonymus, <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸν ῥίψασπιν</foreign>, and assumed the appearance of timid deer ; to-day, they behold <lb/>
            Cleisthenes amongst the audience, and change themselves into women. Clouds <lb/>
            348-355. The Clouds would behold in the theatre nothing more <lb/>
            womanly than Cleisthenes.</p><pb n="xxxii"/>
            
          <p>That the audience are always described in the masculine gender, <foreign xml:lang="grc">οί <lb/>
            θεαταὶ, οὶ θεώμενοι, οἱ καθήμενοι</foreign>, is of course quite unimportant. But when <lb/>
            Dicaeopolis commences his elaborate speech in the Achamians with the <lb/>
            words <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἄνδρες</foreign> ot <foreign xml:lang="grc">θεώμενοι</foreign> (497), and Euelpides commences his explanation <lb/>
            in the Birds with the words <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὥνδες οἱ παρόντεςἐν λόγῳ</foreign>(30), is it con­ <lb/>
            ceivable that they are either including women under the description of <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἄνδρες</foreign>, or else addressing a section only of the audience ?</p>
          <p>There is hardly a play wherein we do not find numerous passages which <lb/>
            seem to take for granted that all the spectators are men, such as, for <lb/>
            example, Knights 228 <foreign xml:lang="grc">τῶν θεατῶν ὅστις ὶστὶδεξιὸς</foreign>, the catechism in <lb/>
            Clouds 1096-1104, the various appeals to the audience to take political <lb/>
            proceedings, which men alone can take, of which the Parabasis of the <lb/>
            Achamians and the Epirrhema and Antepirrhema of the Frogs are <lb/>
            sufficient instances. Conversely, we find passages relating to women <lb/>
            which seem to take for granted that they are not present in the theatre. <lb/>
            Thus in the Antepirrhema to the first Parabasis of the Birds, the Birds <lb/>
            are setting forth the many advantages of wings. And they say, amongst <lb/>
            other things, " If a man is in love with a councillor's wife, and see the <lb/>
            councillor in the theatre, he can fly off at once and pay court to the <lb/>
            wife." They do not say, " If the councillor is in the theatre, and his wife <lb/>
            is not;" the latter circumstance they take for granted.</p>
          <p>But perhaps the clearest and most convincing evidence is afforded by <lb/>
            the Parabasis of the Thesmophoriazusae. The Chorus in that play <lb/>
            represent Athenian matrons, and in the Parabasis they are turning to the <lb/>
            audience, and pleading the cause of the women as against the men. And <lb/>
            throughout their address they contrast the women sometimes with men <lb/>
            in general and sometimes with the audience, quite indifferently, as though <lb/>
            the two classes-the audience and the men—were for this purpose <lb/>
            identical. "All men," they aver, "say that we are a plague" (and, <lb/>
            indeed, this is a commonplace of Hellenic poetry). " Well, then, if we <lb/>
            are a plague, why do YE," they say to the audience, " marry us, <foreign xml:lang="grc">τί γαμεῖθ' <lb/>
            ἡμᾶς</foreign> ; Why do ye forbid us to walk abroad, <foreign xml:lang="grc">κὰπαγορεύετε μήτ'ἐξελθεῖν</foreign>, <lb/>
            &amp;c.? Why are ye so anxious to preserve a plague, TO <foreign xml:lang="grc">κακὸν βούλεσθε</foreign> <lb/>
             <pb n="xxxiii"/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">φυλάττειν</foreign> ; " And after several similar observations, they propose a test. <lb/>
            " We say that we are much better than you, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ύμῶν ἐσμὲνπολὺ βελτίους</foreign>, and <lb/>
            this we will show by taking the name of an individual man and the <lb/>
            name of an individual woman, and comparing them with each other." <lb/>
            They accordingly make several witty comparisons, and conclude by saying <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὔτωςἡμεῖς πολὺβελτίους τῶνἀνδρῶν εὐχόμεθ' εἶναι</foreign>. It was <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὑμῶν πολὺ <lb/>
            βετίους</foreign>at the beginning, it is <foreign xml:lang="grc">τῶν ἀνδρῶν πολὺ βελτίους</foreign> at the end. <lb/>
            But, indeed, almost every line of the Parabasis postulates that the <lb/>
            audience are all of the male sex.</p>
          <p>In every comedy of Aristophanes (with the exception of the Plutus) <lb/>
            there are constant appeals to the audience; and frequently, as in Wasps <lb/>
            74-84, particular individuals are singled out for personal satire. Yet <lb/>
            nowhere is there the slightest indication of the presence of a woman <lb/>
            amongst the spectators. Contrast with this the case of Shakespeare. <lb/>
            How rarely does he address the audience ! How plain he makes it that <lb/>
            women, as well as men, were spectators of his plays!</p>
          <p>The passages cited might easily be doubled : and against them there <lb/>
            is not a syllable1 to be set from the first line of the Acharnians to the <lb/>
            last line of the Plutus. And there seems, therefore, no doubt that no <lb/>
            women were present at the performance of any of these comedies.</p>
          <p>Whether they were present at the representations of the later phases of <lb/>
            Athenian comedy, is quite another matter, and on this point I express no <lb/>
            opinion. But the two passages most commonly cited to prove their <lb/>
            presence seem to be altogether beside the mark.</p>
          <p>Pollux (ix. 5. segm. 44), to illustrate the word <foreign xml:lang="grc">κερκὶς</foreign>, which, like the <lb/>
            Latin cunem, meant one of the wedge-shaped sections into which the <lb/>
            auditorium was cut by gangways ascending from the bottom to the top, <note type="footnote"> <unclear/> Mr. Haigh indeed seems to think that some inference in favour of the presence <lb/>
            of women can be drawn from Peace 962-967, where it is said that though every <lb/>
            individual spectator has got some barley, the women (or perhaps, their wives) have <lb/>
            none. I have not cited this passage as an argument in favour of the absence of <lb/>
            the women, because the whole statement depends upon an idle jest; but it <lb/>
            certainly affords no argument in favour of their presence. </note> <note type="footnote"> ECCL. </note> <note type="footnote"> c </note> <lb/>

            quotes a couplet from the <foreign xml:lang="grc">Γυναικοκρατία</foreign> of Alexis, a poet of the Middle <lb/>
            Comedy, <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BELL_67_fig5.jpg"/></figure> <lb/>
              Undoubtedly this looks as though the women were taking their seats in <lb/>
              the theatre, seemingly as envoys from some foreign state. But this is in <lb/>
              a <foreign xml:lang="grc">γυναικοκρατία</foreign>, where everything is topsy-turvey, where the men and <lb/>
              women have changed places, and the women undertake the duties, and <lb/>
              enjoy the privileges, which under other forms of government would be <lb/>
              undertaken and enjoyed by the men. In line 460 of the Ecclesiazusae it <lb/>
              is announced that the wife, and not the husband, will henceforth attend <lb/>
              the dicastery; and had the subject been pursued, it would doubtless have <lb/>
              been elicited that the wife, and not the husband, was thenceforth to <lb/>
              attend the theatre. No inference can be drawn from this passage as <lb/>
              to the attendance of women at the Athenian theatre.</p>
          <p>The other passage comes from the Epistles of Alciphron, a writer of <lb/>
            great wit and ingenuity, in many respects closely resembling Lucian. <lb/>
            He composed various fictitious letters, generally between fictitious people, <lb/>
            but sometimes he selected historical personages to be his assumed cor­ <lb/>
            respondents. And one of his letters is feigned to be written by Menander <lb/>
            to his mistress Glycera, on his receiving a summons to attend the Court <lb/>
            of King Ptolemy in Egypt. And Alciphron makes the great comedian <lb/>
            say that no diadem which Ptolemy can give him is to be compared with <lb/>
            the ivy-wreaths with which he has so often been crowned at the Dionysia' <lb/>
            "whilst Glycera. was looking on, and sitting in the theatre," <foreign xml:lang="grc">δρώσηςκαὶ <lb/>
            καθημένης ἐν τῷ θεάτρὧῳ Γλυκέρας</foreign>. Now if this passage stood alone, we <lb/>
            might consider it "conclusive proof," not indeed, as Mr. Haigh says, <lb/>
            " that women were present at the New Comedy," but that Alciphron who <lb/>
            flourished, probably, 500 or 600 years afterwards, was of that opinion. <lb/>
            But the passage does not stand alone. Alciphron also composed an <lb/>
            answer from Glycera to Menander's supposed letter. And he makes her <lb/>
            say, " What is Menander without his Glycera, who gets ready his masks, <lb/>
            and arrays him in his actors robes, and stands in the <foreign xml:lang="grc">παρασκήνια</foreign> " (the <lb/>
             <pb n="xxxv"/>
            wings from which the actors entered the stage) " nervously pinching her <lb/>
            fingers, until the theatre breaks out into ringing applause, and then <lb/>
            trembling all over, by Artemis, she revives, and clasps him in her <lb/>
            embrace ? " Is it not plain that Alciphron pictured Glycera not amongst <lb/>
            the audience, but in the wings of the theatre; not only not amongst the <lb/>
            audience, but not even in their sight ?</p>
          <p>These passages, therefore, seem to have no bearing on the question, <lb/>
            whether women did or did not sit as spectators in the Athenian theatre, <lb/>
            during the representation of what are known as the Middle and the New <lb/>
            Comedies.</p>

          <p>THE stage represents an Athenian <lb/>
            street, with three houses in the back­ <lb/>
            ground, the houses of Blepyrus, Chremes, <lb/>
            and the husband of the Second Woman. <lb/>
            The hour is 3 a m. and the stars are <lb/>
            still visible in the sky. A young and <lb/>
            delicate woman, clad in masculine attire, <lb/>
            is standing in the street, hanging up <lb/>
            a lighted lamp in some conspicuous <lb/>
            place. The woman is Praxagora, the <lb/>
            wife of Blepyrus, who has just left her <lb/>
            husband asleep within, and has come <lb/>
            out wearing his garments, with his <lb/>
            sturdy walking-stick in her hand, and <lb/>
            his red Laconian shoes upon her feet. <lb/>
            And the lamp is to serve as a signal to <lb/>
            other Athenian women who have agreed <lb/>
            to meet her here before the break of <lb/>
            day. No one is yet in sight: and <lb/>
            while she is expecting their arrival, <lb/>
            she apostrophizes the lamp in mock­ <lb/>
            heroic style, using such language as <lb/>
            in tragedy might be addressed to the <lb/>
            sun or moon or to some divine or heroic <lb/>
            personage. According to the Scholiast <lb/>
            the poet, in this opening speech, is <lb/>
            glancing at some passage in the tragedies <lb/>
            either of Agathon or of Dicaeogenes. <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BELL_67_fig13.jpg"/></figure> <lb/>
              refers to the addresses to the sun con­ <lb/>
              tained in the Ajax of Sophocles (845) <lb/>
              and in the opening lines of the Phoenissae <lb/>
              of Euripides. <figure type="illustration">

              The Scholiast is however quite mis­ <lb/>
              taken ; for earthen vessels of this <lb/>
              character were regularly fashioned by <lb/>
              the potter's wheel, an instrument well <lb/>
              described in Dr. Lardner's Museum of <lb/>
              Science and Art (vol. ii. 114-117) from <lb/>
              which the remarks which follow are <lb/>
              derived. The upper part of the instru­ <lb/>
              ment consists of a vertical shaft rising <lb/>
              out of a small circular table, and having <lb/>
              at its top a circular horizontal disk. To <lb/>

          <p>PRAXAGORA. O glowing visage of the earthen lamp, <lb/>
            On this conspicuous eminence well-hung,­</p>
          <p>imparted from below. The potter's <lb/>
            clay, having been moistened with water <lb/>
            until it has acquired the consistency <lb/>
            of dough, is placed on this horizontal <lb/>
            disk, the shaft is made to revolve, and <lb/>
            as the disk spins round, the potter gives <lb/>
            the desired shape to the plastic clay, <lb/>
            by the gentle pressure of his hands <lb/>
            and fingers. The rude and soft mass <lb/>
            of dough acquires under his dexterous <lb/>
            fingers the most symmetrical and beauti­ <lb/>
            ful forms with marvellous facility and <lb/>
            celerity. The potter's wheel is con­ <lb/>
            stantly mentioned, as in the Scriptures. <lb/>
            so in the classical writers of Greece and <lb/>
            Rome. Homer compares the light <lb/>
            evolutions of the dance with the quick <lb/>
            movement of the wheel in the hands <lb/>
            of the potter.</p>
          <p>"And now, with feet all cunningly gliding, around whirled they <lb/>
            Full lightly, as when some potter sitteth and maketh assay <lb/>
            Of the wheel to his hands well fitted, to know if it runncth true." <lb/>
            Iliad xviii. 599 (WAY'S translation).</p>
          <p>Such passages as the "Amphora coepit <lb/>
            Institui: currente rota cur urceus exit ? It <lb/>
            of Horace (Ars Poet. 21) and the “Testa <lb/>

            at the top of the lamp is not a <foreign xml:lang="grc">μυκτὴρ</foreign>; <lb/>
            it is the orifice through which the oil is <lb/>

            were accustomed to keep their household <lb/>
            stores under lock and key, with their <lb/>
            seal, for greater security, affixed to the <lb/>
            door. Athenian wives were accustomed, <lb/>
            so soon as their husbands' backs were <lb/>
            turned, to tamper with the seal, pick <lb/>
            the lock, and pilfer from the store-room <lb/>
            corn and wine and oil for their own <lb/>
            private purposes. Such at least is the <lb/>
            charge brought against them in the <lb/>
            Thesmophoriazusae, which teems with <lb/>
            allusions to these petty feminine thefts: <lb/>
            see 418-428, 555, 556, 812, 813. In the <lb/>
            first of these passages the word <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὑποῖξαι</foreign> <lb/>

            seer; and near it a Temple of Athene <lb/>
            Sciras. It was attended by the priestess <lb/>
            of Athene, the priest of the Sun, and the <lb/>
            priest of Erechtheus who came down <lb/>

            lines which the Scholiasts connect with <lb/>
            some tragic play of Agathon or Dicaeo­ <lb/>
            genes. And it seems probable that Phyro­ <lb/>
            machus (or Sphyromachus or Cleoma­ <lb/>
            chus) was the hero of the play, who bad <lb/>
            directed his <foreign xml:lang="grc">έταίρους</foreign> (doubtless the Chorus <lb/>
            of the drama) to lie unobserved in am­ <lb/>
            bush. whilst he himself was undertaking <lb/>
            some perilous adventure. And here we <lb/>
            have, I suspect, the very words of the <lb/>
            Coryphaeus, reminding the Chorus of <lb/>
            their leader's direction. This explains <lb/>
            the words <foreign xml:lang="grc">εὶ μέμνησθ᾽ ἔτι</foreign>, which other­ <lb/>
            wipe would be strangely out of place in <lb/>
            Praxagora's soliloquy. We may well <lb/>
            believe that something in the speaker's <lb/>
            intonation or, it may be, his known dis­ <lb/>
            solute character, suggested the change <lb/>
            of <foreign xml:lang="grc">τοὺς έταίρους</foreign> into <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὰς έταίρας</foreign>. Possibly <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">Κλεόμαχος</foreign> was the name of the actor or <lb/>
            of the Coryphaeus. The Scholiast offers <lb/>
            a second explanation <foreign xml:lang="grc">ό δὲ Σφυρόμαχος <lb/>
            ψήφισμα εἰσηγήσατο ὤστε τὰς γυναῖκας καὶ <lb/>

            heard of such a decree, or can imagine <lb/>
            any festival or meeting to which it can <lb/>
            possibly apply, this second explanation <lb/>
            may safely be disregarded. The Scholiast <lb/>
            evidently takes it to apply to the regular <lb/>
            assemblies of the people, which of course <lb/>
            is quite out of the question.</p><pb n="8"/>

            they are concluded. She is entering <lb/>
            quite alone, and the expression <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἡμᾶν <lb/>

            known rule which Dawes laid down in <lb/>
            his criticism on line 516 of this play, <lb/>
            and which is more pointedly enunciated <lb/>
            by Person at Hec. 509, " Si mulier de Be <lb/>

            is considered to take place about the <lb/>
            close of the third watch of the night; <lb/>
            that is, about 3 a.m., each nightwatch <lb/>
            occupying three hours; viz.(1)6 to 9 p.m., <lb/>
            (2) 9 p.m. to 12, (3) 12 to 3 a.m., (4) 3 to <lb/>
            6 a.m. It is strange that Juvenal (ix. <lb/>
            107) should use the expression the <lb/>
            crowing of the second cock" for the <lb/>
            second crowing of the cock "; but our <lb/>
            own writers do the same. Thus in <lb/>
            Romeo and Juliet, iv. 4, old Capulet, who <lb/>
            has been up all night hastening on the <lb/>
            wedding festivities, says The second <lb/>
            cock has crowed, 'tis three o'clock." In <lb/>
            the last scene of Richard III, however, <lb/>
            Shakespeare puts it rightly <lb/>
            "The early village cock <lb/>
            Hath twice done salutation to the morn " : <lb/>
            and some time afterwards when the <lb/>
            question is asked How far into the <lb/>

            " Upon the stroke of four."</p>
          <p>33. <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὴν νύκτα πᾶσαν</foreign>] Praxagora, though <lb/>

          <p>38. <foreign xml:lang="grc">Σαλαμίνιος</foreign>] It is probable that <lb/>
            there was a sort of ferry between <lb/>
            Salamis and the mainland of Attica; <lb/>
            and that the Salaminians were inces­ <lb/>
            santly rowing, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐλαύνοντες</foreign>, boats (which <lb/>
            were called <foreign xml:lang="grc">κέλητες</foreign>) across the straits, <lb/>
            to carry passengers to and fro. See <lb/>
            Lysistrata 60, Frogs 204. And cf. Xen. <lb/>
            Hell. v. 1. 23. And as the words <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐλαύ­ <lb/>
            νειν</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">κέλης</foreign> were both used also in <lb/>
            re amatoria, the name “Salaminian” <lb/>
            became in vulgar language the equiva­ <lb/>
            lent of <foreign xml:lang="grc">συνουσιαστικός</foreign>. We have now <lb/>
            on the stage Praxagora and two other <lb/>
            women, who are doubtless represented <lb/>
            by the three professional or state actors, <lb/>
            that is to say, by the three actors pro­ <lb/>
            vided by the state at the public expense. <lb/>
            But lines 54-56 are unquestionably <lb/>
            delivered by a fourth speaker, and if <lb/>
            she were a fourth woman on the stage, <lb/>
            she would have been represented by a <lb/>
            choregic actor, that is, an additional <lb/>
            actor supplied by the choregus at his <lb/>
            own expense. Choregic actors are by <lb/>
            no means uncommon in these comedies, <lb/>
            and the attempts made to eliminate <lb/>
            them have always been ludicrously un­ <lb/>
            successful. Such cases as those of Lysi­ <lb/>
            strata, Calonice, Myrrhina, and Lampito <lb/>
            in the Lysistrata; of Dionysus, Xanth­ <lb/>
            ias, and the two hostesses in the Frogs; <lb/>
            of Dionysus, Aeschylus, Euripides, <lb/>
            and Pluto in the same comedy; and <lb/>
            many others, cannot be explained away. <lb/>
            Still I do not think that we have a <lb/>
            choregic actor here, or that any person <lb/>
            appears upon the stage in this scene, <lb/>
            except Praxagora and the two women <lb/>
            already there. The women who during <lb/>
            the next sixteen lines keep dropping in, <lb/>
            either singly or in small groups, are in <lb/>
            my opinion all members of the Chorus <lb/>
            making their way to the orchestra. <lb/>
            They are probably twelve in all, form­ <lb/>
            ing a semichorus, and representing that <lb/>
            section of Praxagora's followers which <lb/>
            dwelt within the city walls. The other <lb/>
            section, the women from the country, <lb/>
            enter in a body, infra 800, singing their <lb/>
            entrance song. Then the two semi­ <lb/>
            choruses coalesce and become the full <lb/>
            Chorus of the play. And the speaker <lb/>
            of lines 54-56, and a few other lines in <lb/>
            the conversation, is in my opinion the <lb/>
            coryphaeus, who enters with the first <lb/>
            semichorus.</p><pb n="10"/>

            way to the orchestra, seven other women, <lb/>
            all distinguished by their own names or <lb/>
            by the names of their husbands. As <lb/>
            they are passing in, the actors, standing <lb/>
            on the stage, make their comments <lb/>
            about them, exactly as Peisthetaerus <lb/>
            and the Hoopoe, in the Birds, discuss <lb/>
            the members of the Chorus, hurrying in <lb/>
            to the orchestra there. These seven <lb/>
            women were probably well known to the <lb/>
            audience, and doubtless there were <lb/>
            reasons for their selection with which <lb/>
            we are now unacquainted: but we may <lb/>
            conjecture that Smicythion resembled <lb/>
            the " auld man" whom Burns's "young <lb/>
            lassie " married, who's doyl't an' who's <lb/>
            dozin', whose bluid it is frozen," so that <lb/>
            Melistiche found no difficulty in escap­ <lb/>
            ing from him unobserved. And Geusi­ <lb/>
            strata was probably often seen by her <lb/>
            customers in the attitude here depicted, <lb/>

            Athenian democracy. In person, the <lb/>
            Scholiast tells us, he was distinguished <lb/>
            by a beard of such dimensions that be <lb/>
            was dubbed by the Attic wits <foreign xml:lang="grc">᾽Επικράτης <lb/>

            the parallel passage in Suidas, into <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">῎Εφορος</foreign>, until Maussacus (on Harpo­ <lb/>
            cration) restored the genuine reading. <lb/>
            And as in appearance Epicrates was <lb/>
            distinguished by a beard of a size un­ <lb/>
            usual amongst his contemporaries, so <lb/>
            in character he was distinguished by <lb/>
            a career of venality and peculation <lb/>
            unusual even amongst Athenian dema­ <lb/>
            gogues. When the Persians, alarmed <lb/>
            at the progress of Agesilaus in Asia, <lb/>
            sent an envoy to stir up hostility against <lb/>
            Sparta at home, he was one of the few <lb/>
            Athenians (so few that Xenophon <lb/>
            ignored them altogether) who con­ <lb/>
            descended to accept the Persian gold.- <lb/>
            Pausanias, Laconica, ix. 4. Afterwards <lb/>
            he was sent with Phormisius (infra 97) <lb/>
            and others on an embassy to the Persian <lb/>
            Court, and again accepted enormous <lb/>
            bribes to carry out the designs of the <lb/>
            great king. On this charge, coupled <lb/>
            with charges of peculation, he and his <lb/>
            fellow ambassadors were brought to <lb/>
            trial at Athens, and Lysias, who seems <lb/>
            at one time to have been his friend <lb/>
            (see the commencement of the Phaedrus), <lb/>
            wrote against him a hostile speech, of <lb/>
            which only the peroration, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπίλογος</foreign>, has <lb/>
            reached us. It was apparently on this <lb/>
            occasion that, as Plutarch, ubi supra, <lb/>
            informs us, he boldly acknowledged that <lb/>
            he had been enriched by Persian gifts, <lb/>
            and recommended the Athenians instead <lb/>
            of electing eleven archons, to elect <lb/>
            every year eleven pauper ambassadors, <lb/>
            to be enriched at the Persian Court. <lb/>
            At this sally the Assembly laughed <lb/>
            consumedly, and Epicmtes seems to <lb/>
            have been lèt off. Athenaeus, vi. 58, <lb/>
            cites the same anecdote from Hegesander. <lb/>
            In connexion with this embassy too the <lb/>
            poet Plato wrote a play which he called <lb/>
            the Ambassadors, <foreign xml:lang="grc">Πρέσβεις</foreign>, (possibly <lb/>
            the play from which the line cited by <lb/>
            the Scholiast is taken), in which he <lb/>
            said <figure type="illustration">

            be repeated about Phormisius here. <lb/>

            the restoration of the democracy: and <lb/>
            we have already seen that he was joined <lb/>
            with Epicrates as well in the embassy <lb/>
            to the Persian Court, as in the subse­ <lb/>
            quent impeachment for receiving bribes <lb/>
            therein. In the Frogs (965, where see <lb/>
            the note) he is selected by Euripides as <lb/>
            a sample of the rough hirsute personages <lb/>
            which the teaching of Aeschylus was <lb/>
            calculated to turn out; in contrast to <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">Θηραμένης ὁ κομψὸς</foreign>, whom he claims as <lb/>
            the product of his own teaching. After <lb/>

            duced a measure for restricting the <lb/>
            franchise to the owners of land, a pro­ <lb/>

            with the ancient constitution of Athens." <lb/>
            Dionysius of Halicarnassus, who preserves <lb/>

              <foreign xml:lang="grc">εὐρύπρωκτος</foreign>.—Scholiast. The expression <lb/>
              <foreign xml:lang="grc">πρότερον ἦν γυνὴ</foreign> refers of course to <lb/>
              unnatural crimes in which Agyrrhius <lb/>
              as a youth was supposed to have par­ <lb/>
              ticipated. According to Andocides, <lb/>
              whose bitter enemy he was, Agyrrhius <lb/>
              for several years farmed the harbour <lb/>
              dues at a price (thirty talents a year) <lb/>
              very greatly beneath their actual value, <lb/>
              buying off competitors by paying them <lb/>
              a sum down, and promising a share in <lb/>
              the booty. Andocides, perceiving his <lb/>
              knavery, outbid him by offering thirty­ <lb/>
              six talents, and even so made a moderate <lb/>
              profit (Andoc. De Mysteriis, 133, <unclear>134</unclear>. <lb/>
              It was probably in connexion with these <lb/>
              transactions, that he was accused of <lb/>
              embezzlement and thrown into prison <lb/>
              (Dem. in Timocr. 153): but at the <lb/>
              present moment all these ill deeds were <lb/>
              forgotten, and he had become a prime <lb/>
              favourite of the people, by the ordinary <lb/>

          <p>No, if we sit in front and gather round us <lb/>
            Our husbands' garments, none will find us out. <lb/>
            Why, when we've got our flowing beards on there, <lb/>
            Who that beholds us will suppose we're women ? <lb/>
            Was not Agyrrhius erst a woman ? Yet <lb/>
            Now that he wears the beard of Pronomus, <lb/>
            He passes for a man, a statesman too. <lb/>
            O by yon dawning day, 'tis just for that,</p>
          <p>doles. The fall of Athens from her <lb/>
            imperial position must have made it <lb/>
            more difficult for the poorer clashes to <lb/>
            earn their living by attending the dicas­ <lb/>
            teries, and Agyrrhius hit on the idea of <lb/>
            paying them for their attendance at the <lb/>
            Assemblies also. At first he got the <lb/>
            payment (<foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸ ἐκκλησιαστικὸν</foreign>, as it was <lb/>
            called) fixed at one obol: but this <lb/>
            proved ineffective (infra 302); and it <lb/>
            was raised by Heracleides to two obols. <lb/>
            Thereupon, a year or two before the <lb/>
            date of this play, Agyrrhius carried <lb/>
            a further decree fixing it, like the <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">δικαστικὸν</foreign>, at three obols.—Aristotle, <lb/>
            Polity of Athens, chap. 41 ; and see infra <lb/>
            183-188 and 801-810. Hence he became <lb/>
            a leading personage in the state (<foreign xml:lang="grc">πράττει <lb/>
            τὰ μέγιστ᾽ ἐν τῇ πόλει</foreign>, cf. Birds 800), and <lb/>

              and not the illustrious Theban who <lb/>
              taught Alcibiades the flute. This little <lb/>

            such idle fancies as these. She is the <lb/>
            one woman of the party who is thoroughly <lb/>
            sensible, and thoroughly in earnest; and <lb/>
            taking no notice of her companion's <lb/>

            3. But that was thirty years ago: those <lb/>
            scandals must have long since passed <lb/>
            into oblivion. There is nothing un­ <lb/>
            common in the name of Ariphrades; <lb/>
            and the offence here attributed to Ari­ <lb/>
            phrades is merely "talking," an offence <lb/>

            <foreign xml:lang="grc">λαλεῖν ἐπίσταται</foreign>; And in my judgement <lb/>
            Praxagora, in the character of <foreign xml:lang="grc">κῆρυξ</foreign>, is <lb/>
            merely calling upon one of the women <lb/>
            to stop chattering and to come and take <lb/>
            her seat within the line of purification. <lb/>
            She naturally uses a man's name (as if <lb/>
            she were in the real Assembly, cf. infra <lb/>
            293, 294), though of course the adjective <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀριφραδὴς</foreign> is both masculine and feminine. <lb/>
            And <foreign xml:lang="grc">παριὼν</foreign> in the next line is used in <lb/>
            precisely the same sense as <foreign xml:lang="grc">πάριτε</foreign> in <lb/>

            The assumption of a wreath, therefore, <lb/>
            might mean either that the wearer was <lb/>
            about to speak (as Praxagora intended <lb/>
            it), or that she was about to commence <lb/>
            a revel (as her friend interprets it). <lb/>
            A very similar misapprehension occurs, <lb/>
            when Peisthetaerus, about to commence <lb/>
            his oration to the Birds, calls out: <lb/>
            Boy, bring me a wreath for my hair <lb/>

            By a somewhat analogous inference, <lb/>
            from the custom of placing a wreath on <lb/>
            the head after death, it is argued in <lb/>
            the Tagenistae (Fragm. 1 in Meineke's <lb/>
            Fragm. Corn. Graec.) that the dead must <lb/>

            In this our country, and I grieve to note <lb/>
            The sad condition of the stated affairs. <lb/>
            I see the state employing evermore <lb/>

            There was a time, my friends, we never came</p>
          <p>War: Cleon, Hyperbolas, Cleopbon. <lb/>
            In Peace 684 the appellation <foreign xml:lang="grc">πονηρὸς <lb/>
            προστάτης</foreign> is expressly applied to Hyper­ <lb/>
            bolus : and it would almost seem from <lb/>
            Plutus 920 that the combination of <lb/>
            these two words had become, in a <lb/>
            manner, proverbial. Cleopbon appears <lb/>
            to have acquired his supremacy by insti­ <lb/>
            tuting the dole of the <foreign xml:lang="grc">θεωρικὸν</foreign>, and now, <lb/>
            we may well believe, Agyrrhius was <lb/>
            attaining a similar position by his <lb/>
            institution of the dole of the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐκκλησι­ <lb/>
            αστικόν</foreign>. See the note on 102 supra. <lb/>
            For, in my judgement, Praxagora is here <lb/>
            contrasting Agyrrhius as a <foreign xml:lang="grc">πορνηρὸν προσ­ <lb/>
            τάτην</foreign> (whence the epithet <foreign xml:lang="grc">πορνηρὸν</foreign>, 185 <lb/>
            infra) with Thrasybulus: the former <lb/>
            haring only his own aggrandisement <lb/>
            at heart; the latter a genuine patriot, <lb/>
            earnestly promoting the real welfare <lb/>
            of the people. Yet Agyrrhius was fast <lb/>
            becoming the popular favourite, whilst <lb/>
            the influence of Thrasybulus was steadily <lb/>

          <p>Praxagora is contrasting the state of <lb/>
            things before, with the state of things <lb/>
            after, the introduction by Agyrrhius <lb/>
            of the <foreign xml:lang="grc">τρώβολον ἐκκλησιαστικόν</foreign>. She <lb/>
            notices two points of contrast: (1) <lb/>
            Before that period the citizens had <lb/>
            become quite unaccustomed to attend <lb/>
            the Assembly, whereas now they flock <lb/>
            to it. This is the burden of the second <lb/>
            semichorus, infra 300-310; and cf. <lb/>
            Plutus 329. (2) Before that period <lb/>
            everybody recognized that Agyrrhius <lb/>
            was a rogue: whereas now it is difficult <lb/>
            to praise him enough. The words <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐκ <lb/>
            ἐχρώμεθα</foreign> simply mean that the habit of <lb/>
            attending the Assembly had fallen into <lb/>
            general disuse.</p>
          <p>186. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ύπερεπῄνεσεν</foreign>] Here again Bothe <lb/>
            absurdly says, nimium laudare solet con­ <lb/>
            ciones, whereas the meaning is lauded <lb/>
            Agyrrhius to the skies, extravagantly <lb/>
            praised Agyrrhius. But indeed none <lb/>
            * of the commentators seem to have the <lb/>
            slightest inkling of what Praxagora is <lb/>
            talking about in this portion of her <lb/>
            speech, all of them esteeming apparently <lb/>
            the minutiae of the poet's language of <lb/>
            more account than the working of the <lb/>
            poet's mind.</p>

          <p>these comedies is Thesm. 254, and it <lb/>
            is an exception which proves the rule; <lb/>
            for there it is used by Mnesilochus, who <lb/>
            is being dressed up in woman's clothes, <lb/>
            to pass off as a woman, and who there­ <lb/>
            fore naturally employs the oath proper <lb/>
            to a woman. The words <foreign xml:lang="grc">μηδ᾽ ἐθίζου</foreign>. two <lb/>
            lines below, mean Don't get into the habit <lb/>
            of praising me in that manner. It is not <lb/>
            unusual with the poet, when one of his <lb/>
            characters is making an argumentative <lb/>
            speech, to punctuate each branch of <lb/>
            the argument by some such interruption <lb/>
            as the present. See the note on Wasps <lb/>
            559. Here Praxagora's argument is <lb/>
            divided by interruptions into four sec­ <lb/>
            tions. The object of the first section <lb/>
            was to show how men mismanage the <lb/>
            internal affairs of the state by giving <lb/>
            their confidence to corrupt and profli­ <lb/>
            gate self-seekers like Agyrrhius, in <lb/>
            preference to true and tried friends <lb/>
            of the people like Thrasybulus. The <lb/>
            second section relates to their mis­ <lb/>
            management of external affairs by <lb/>
            reason of their impatience and incon­ <lb/>
            stancy. The third section consists of <lb/>
            a proposal that since the men have <lb/>
            proved so incompetent to manage the <lb/>
            state, its affairs should now be placed <lb/>
            in the hands of the women ; whilst <lb/>
            the fourth and last is a prolonged <lb/>
            eulogy of the women, showing their <lb/>
            really very remarkable qualifications <lb/>
            for guiding and preserving the state.</p>

              ance. For Praxagora is beyond all <lb/>
              doubt referring to the momentous <lb/>
              Anti-Spartan League of B. c. 395, which <lb/>
              was inaugurated by the battle of <lb/>
              Haliartus and the death of Lysander, <lb/>
              which at once raised Athens from the <lb/>

              state; and which in its result altered <lb/>

              Originally struck between Thebes and <lb/>
              Athens it was quickly joined by Argos, <lb/>

          <p>and became so powerful that the military <lb/>
            leaders proposed at once to march upon <lb/>
            Sparta and “ destroy the wasps in their <lb/>
            nest." But in the following summer <lb/>
            the great battle of Corinth, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἡ μεγάλη <lb/>
            μάχη πρὸς Λακεδαιμονίους, ἡ ἐν Κορίνθῳ</foreign> <lb/>
            (Demosthenes in Lept. 59) resulted in <lb/>
            a Lacedaemonian victory; and no <lb/>
            contingent suffered so severely as the <lb/>
            Athenian, which was assailed both in <lb/>
            front and on the flank by the Spartan <lb/>
            troops. And shortly afterwards Agesi­ <lb/>
            laus won another victory in the well­ <lb/>
            contested battle of Coronea. No wonder <lb/>
            that the Athenians were disgusted, <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἤχθοντο</foreign>, at this discomfiture of the <lb/>
            League from which they had expected <lb/>
            so much. The historical allusions <lb/>
            contained in this second section of <lb/>
            Praxagora's speech are considered more <lb/>
            fully in the Introduction.</p>
          <p>196. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὁ τοῦτ᾽ ἀναπείσας</foreign>] <foreign xml:lang="grc">Κόνωνα λέγει</foreign>, <lb/>
            says the Scholiast; a very natural <lb/>
            mistake, since Conon was the author <lb/>
            of all the abiding benefits which the <lb/>
            Athenians derived from theAnti-Spartan <lb/>
            League. He broke the naval power of <lb/>
            Sparta in the battle of Cnidus, swept <lb/>
            the Lacedaemonian garrisons from the <lb/>
            isles of the Aegean, and returned home, <lb/>
            a second Themistocles, to rebuild the <lb/>
            Long Walls of Athens and the forti­ <lb/>
            fications of Peiraeus. But far from <lb/>
            being the orator who induced them to <lb/>
            enter into the League, he was not even <lb/>
            in Athens at the time. From the <lb/>
            disaster at Aegospotami until his <lb/>
            triumphant return to Athens some <lb/>
            months after the exhibition of this <lb/>
            play, he had been continuously in the <lb/>
            service of Evagoras of Cyprus or <lb/>
            the Persian King. Nor did he ever fall <lb/>
            under the censure of the Athenians. <lb/>
            The allusion here is doubtless to the <lb/>
            most persuasive of the many speakers <lb/>
            (<foreign xml:lang="grc">πάμπολλοι ξυνηγόρευον</foreign>, Xen. Hell. iii. <lb/>
            5. 16) who advocated the formation <lb/>
            of the League. It cannot have been <lb/>
            Thrasybulus, who seems to have been <lb/>
            very cautious and undecided in the <lb/>
            matter, and whose case is mentioned <lb/>

            had been permitted to maintain twelve <lb/>
            triremes and no more, a number doubt­ <lb/>

            Yet when they'd got it, they disliked it. He <lb/>
            Who pushed it through was forced to cut and run. <lb/>

            Argeius was a fool: now Jerome's wise.</p>
          <p>purposes. But so soon as they had <lb/>
            recovered their independence, their <lb/>
            first object would be to increase their <lb/>
            fleet; and accordingly, a year or two <lb/>
            later, we find them in possession of <lb/>
            very considerable naval armaments. At <lb/>
            Athens the duty of equipping a trireme <lb/>
            was not, as a rule, performed at the <lb/>
            public expense, but was imposed upon <lb/>
            some wealthy citizen, so that the in­ <lb/>
            crease of the fleet was not always a <lb/>
            matter for rejoicing with the richer <lb/>
            classes, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐβαροῦντο γὰρ ταῖς τριηραρχίαις</foreign>, <lb/>
            as the Scholiast says. As to the <foreign xml:lang="grc">γεωργοὶ</foreign>, <lb/>
            whether rich or poor, their lands were <lb/>
            always exposed to the incursions of an <lb/>
            enemy, and they were consequently al­ <lb/>
            ways averse to war. " Had Attica been <lb/>
            an island, and the Athenians masters of <lb/>
            the sea," says Xenophon (De Rep. Ath. <lb/>
            ii. 14), “they would have escaped all <lb/>
            the evils of war: <foreign xml:lang="grc">νῦν δὲ οἱ γεωργοῦντες <lb/>
            καὶ οὶ πλούσιοι ᾽Αθηναίων ὑπέρχοιται</foreign> (come <lb/>

            <foreign xml:lang="grc">τοὺς πολεμίους μᾶλλον</foreign>.” The terms <foreign xml:lang="grc">δοκεῖ</foreign> <lb/>
            and <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐ δοκεῖ</foreign> relate to the voting of <lb/>
            the different classes in the Assembly, <lb/>
            and, to a member of Oxford or Cam­ <lb/>
            bridge, are well represented in Le <lb/>

            whose animosity to Athens had been the <lb/>
            immediate occasion of the Peloponnesian <lb/>
            War, and who throughout, and at the <lb/>
            termination of, the war, had shown <lb/>
            themselves her most rancorous enemies, <lb/>
            were nevertheless amongst the earliest <lb/>
            to join, and the most eager in supporting, <lb/>
            the Anti-Spartan League. But in the <lb/>
            second year of the League, the war was <lb/>
            transferred into the territory of Corinth, <lb/>
            which was systematically desolated by <lb/>
            sword and fire. A large minority of her <lb/>
            citizens became desirous of returning to <lb/>
            the Spartan alliance; we hear of the <lb/>
            gates of the city being closed against <lb/>
            the fugitives after the battle of Corinth; <lb/>
            and it may possibly be inferred from <lb/>
            the present passage that there was a <lb/>
            recrudescence at Athens of the old <lb/>
            anti-Corinthian feeling. Praxagora <lb/>
            therefore, not now merely stating <lb/>
            facts, but giving her own opinion, ex­ <lb/>
            horts them to meet the friendly dis­ <lb/>
            position of Corinth with equal friendli­ <lb/>
            ness.</p>

          <p>Praxagora, giving instances of the muta­ <lb/>
            bility and perversity of Athenian opinion, <lb/>
            says, Ye thought Argeius a blockhead, and <lb/>
            yet ye think Hieronymus clever. Whether <lb/>
            their characters are reversed, as the <lb/>
            Scholiast-thinks, or whether they were <lb/>
            both rude and ignorant men, it is im­ <lb/>
            possible to say. Argeius as a proper <lb/>
            name occurs in Xenophon's Hellenics <lb/>
            and elsewhere. Hieronymus was a <lb/>
            common Athenian name, and it is very <lb/>
            unlikely that Praxagora is referring, as <lb/>
            Paulmier supposes, to the officer whom <lb/>
            Conon, on his departure for Babylon, <lb/>
            left in part command of the Persian <lb/>
            and allied navy in Cyprus. The Hierony­ <lb/>
            mus mentioned here was doubtless some <lb/>
            obscure politician in Athens. The line <lb/>
            appears to be introduced, after the <lb/>
            manner of Aristophanes, and like the <lb/>
            reference to Aesimus a few lines below, <lb/>
            to touch a lighter chord in the midst <lb/>
            of Praxagora's serious arraignment of <lb/>
            Athenian policy.</p>
          <p>202. <foreign xml:lang="grc">Σωτηρία</foreign>] <foreign xml:lang="grc">Σωτηρία</foreign> is personified <lb/>
            here as Salus in the Latin proverbial <lb/>
            expression " Nec Salus nobis saluti jam <lb/>
            esse, si cupiat, potest," Plautus, Mostel­ <lb/>
            laria, ii. 1. 4; Captivi, iii. 3. 14; Cistel­ <lb/>
            laria, iv. 2. 76. The expression is used <lb/>
            also by Terence and Cicero, and doubt­ <lb/>
            less was borrowed from them by the <lb/>
            Elizabethan statesman Davison, when <lb/>
            he addressed his queen as one whom <lb/>
            Salvation itself is not able to save, if <lb/>
            these purposes are continued.”—Motley's <lb/>
            United Netherlands, i. 423. The mean­ <lb/>
            ingof <foreign xml:lang="grc">παρακίπτειν</foreign> is well illustrated by the <lb/>
            invocation in Peace 978 seq., where Peace <lb/>
            is adjured not merely just to show her <lb/>
            face and withdraw it again (<foreign xml:lang="grc">παρακύπτειν</foreign>), <lb/>
            but to reveal herself in her full and <lb/>
            perfect beauty to the gaze of her devoted <lb/>
            admirers, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀπόφηνον ὅλην σαυτήν</foreign>. Cf. <lb/>

            Conon at Cnidus, but this, in the opinion <lb/>
            of Praxagora, was more or less counter­ <lb/>
            balanced by the growing alienation <lb/>
            of the people from the counsels of <lb/>
            Thrasybulus, who had brought them <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">σωτρίηία</foreign> in even darker days than <lb/>

            self, not now called upon for advice, is <lb/>
            banished from our counsels. It is clear <lb/>
            that before the death of Thrasybulus <lb/>
            his influence and popularity at Athens <lb/>
            had been for some time on the wane. <lb/>
            He did not distinguish himself, either <lb/>
            as a general or as a soldier, at the <lb/>
            battle of Corinth: and shortly after­ <lb/>
            wards, and apparently about the date of <lb/>
            this comedy, Lysias, in the speech com­ <lb/>
            posed for Mantitheus, indulges in a</p><pb n="35"/>
            
          <p>Safety just showed her face: but Thrasybulus, <lb/>
            No more called in, is quite excluded now.</p>
          <p>1st W. Here's a shrewd man I PRAX. Ah, now you praise me rightly. <lb/>
            Ye are to blame for this, Athenian people, <lb/>
            Ye draw your wages from the public purse,</p>
          <p>gird at " our grand Steirian," on which <lb/>
            he would not have ventured, had he not <lb/>
            felt confident that the sneer would be <lb/>
            relished by his auditors. Meanwhile <lb/>
            Agyrrhius was supplanting him as a <lb/>
            popular favourite: and not long after <lb/>
            the date of the play, Conon was at <lb/>
            Athens, restoring the Long Walls and the <lb/>
            fortifications of Peiraeus, and devising <lb/>
            large schemes, which extended from <lb/>
            Asia Minor to Sicily, for the rehabilita­ <lb/>
            tion of the Athenian empire. It is quite <lb/>
            possible that this adventurous policy, <lb/>
            devised by an officer in the Persian <lb/>
            service, aided by a Persian satrap, and <lb/>
            only feasible by means of Persian ships <lb/>
            and Persian gold, was unpalatable to <lb/>
            Thrasybulus, and at the same time quite <lb/>
            eclipsed, in the minds of the Athenians, <lb/>
            his more sober and moderate counsels. <lb/>
            It was a repetition of the rivalry of <lb/>
            Themistocles and Aristides some eighty <lb/>
            years before. A year or two later <lb/>
            Thrasybulus left Athens, with a fleet of <lb/>
            forty triremes, and seems to have done <lb/>
            much good work along the coast of Asia <lb/>
            Minor from Byzantium to the river <lb/>
            Eurymedon. Whilst his fleet was moored <lb/>
            in that river, he received an order re­ <lb/>
            calling him and his colleagues to Athens <lb/>
            to meet a charge of embezzlement: but <lb/>
            before he could obey the order he was <lb/>
            slain by the citizens of Aspendus, who <lb/>
            were incensed by wrongs inflicted upon <lb/>
            them by his troops. His colleague <lb/>
            Ergocles, returning to stand his trial, <lb/>
            was found guilty and put to death. We <lb/>
            still have the speech, or part of the <lb/>
            speech, composed by Lysias against <lb/>
            Ergocles : and it is painful to read the <lb/>
            language which the orator permitted <lb/>
            himself to use about Thrasybulus, his <lb/>
            own benefactor, and still more painful <lb/>
            to reflect that, in his opinion, such <lb/>
            language was calculated to further his <lb/>
            cause before the Athenian dicastery. <lb/>
            Thrasybulus, he says, did well to die as <lb/>
            he did: for it was not fitting that he <lb/>
            should live: neither teas it fitting that he <lb/>
            should die at your hands, whom he is <lb/>
            thought to hare benefited somewhat in <lb/>
            other days. The Scholiast's statement <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὑτος αὑθάδης καὶ δωροδόκος, ὑπερόπτης ὤν <lb/>
            τοῦ δήμου, ἠβούλετο δι᾽ αὐτοῦ πάντα πάντ­ <lb/>
            τεσθαι</foreign>, may well have been based upon <lb/>
            some other speech made on this occasion, <lb/>
            and the final clause doubtless refers to <lb/>
            his standing aloof from the far-reaching <lb/>
            schemes of Conon. <foreign xml:lang="grc">άρίζεται</foreign>, like <foreign xml:lang="grc">ύπερο­ <lb/>

            though here it signifies banishment, not <lb/>

            novel substitute ? And so, I think, the <lb/>
            Scholiast understood the passage: tl <lb/>

            not, after the manner of men, on their <lb/>
            shoulders or in their hands, but poised <lb/>
            upon their heads. So the <foreign xml:lang="grc">κανηφόρος</foreign> bore <lb/>

            Irish peasant girls may be seen to-day, <lb/>
            carrying their pitchers from the well. <lb/>
            The custom has always been affected by <lb/>
            women, partly no doubt because it is <lb/>
            known to lend to the female figure a <lb/>
            singular elasticity and uprightness of <lb/>
            carriage. Herodotus, indeed, as Bergler <lb/>

            were composed of different ingredients <lb/>
            and known specifically by different <lb/>

            They keep their Thesmophoria, as of old : <lb/>
            They bake their honied cheesecakes, as of old ; <lb/>
            They victimize their husbands, as of old : <lb/>

            The helm of state, and not concern ourselves, <lb/>
            Nor pry, nor question what they mean to do; <lb/>
            But let them really govern, knowing this, <lb/>
            The statesman-mothers never will neglect <lb/>

            They werewheaten (or sometimes barley) <lb/>
            cakes, flavoured with various rich sub­ <lb/>
            stances such as wine and oil and cheese; <lb/>
            but honey seems to have been the special <lb/>
            ingredient which distinguished them <lb/>
            from ordinary cakes: and the superiority <lb/>
            of the Attic <foreign xml:lang="grc">πλακοῦς</foreign> was attributed to <lb/>
            the superiority of the Attic honey. Athe­ <lb/>
            naeus (iii. 59) cites some lines to this <lb/>
            effect from Archestratus, the laureate of <lb/>
            epicures: <lb/>
            Also a rich honey-cake <lb/>
            From Athens be sure that you get us; <lb/>
            If it come not from thence you must take <lb/>
            Some honey obtained from Hymettus <lb/>
            To give it the flavour which makes <lb/>
            The Attic the proudest of cakes. <lb/>
            The same inference may be drawn from <lb/>
            the answer of Demonax to one who asked <lb/>
            him if he ate <foreign xml:lang="grc">πλακοῦντας</foreign>. What, think <lb/>
            you, said he, that bees make their honey­ <lb/>
            combs for fools only ?—Lucian, Demonax, <lb/>

          <p>243. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐν ταῖς φυγαῖς</foreign>] The Scholiast <lb/>
            refers these words to the banishments <lb/>
            and proscriptions inflicted by the Thirty; <lb/>
            and Dobree, concurring in this view, <lb/>
            refers to Plato's Apology, chap. v, where <lb/>
            the Platonic Socrates, commending the <lb/>
            loyalty of Chaerephon to the democracy, <lb/>
            says <foreign xml:lang="grc">ξυνέφυγε τὴν φυγὴν ταύτην, καὶ μεθ' <lb/>
            ύμῶν κατῆλθε</foreign> ;and where Riddell cites <lb/>
            Isocrates de Pace 149, <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὰς φυγὰς τὰς ἐπὶ <lb/>
            τῶν τυράννων καὶ ἐπὶ τῶν τριάκοντα γενο­ <lb/>
            μένας</foreign>. But the Scholiast'e notion that <lb/>
            fugitives from the Thirty would en­ <lb/>
            deavour to conceal themselves by flock­ <lb/>
            ing to the Pnyx, one of the most public <lb/>
            and exposed places in Athens, is ob­ <lb/>
            viously untenable; and beyond all ques­ <lb/>
            tion Praxagora is speaking, not of a <lb/>
            general flight from Athens, but of a <lb/>
            general flight into Athens. Paulmier <lb/>
            therefore refers the passage to the <lb/>
            crowding of the country people into <lb/>
            the city at the commencement of the <lb/>
            Peloponnesian War (Thuc. ii. 17) :and <lb/>
            this explanation is now generally ac­ <lb/>
            cepted. But besides the extreme im­ <lb/>
            probability that a young woman like <lb/>
            Praxagora should represent herself as <lb/>
            fleeing into Athens with her husband <lb/>
            nearly forty years before, and having at <lb/>
            that remote period acquired the rhe­ <lb/>
            torical powers which she is now for the <lb/>
            first time putting into practice, it must <lb/>
            be remembered that the greater part of <lb/>
            the audience had probably been born <lb/>
            since that date, and that even amongst <lb/>
            the elder spectators the memory of those <lb/>
            distant days must have grown faint and <lb/>
            dim in comparison with the momentous <lb/>
            events which had recently occurred at <lb/>
            Athens. And in my opinion the flight <lb/>
            to which Praxagora is alluding is the <lb/>
            flight of the Athenians from the islands <lb/>
            and seaports into the city before the <lb/>
            conquering progress of Lysander. We <lb/>
            know that after his great success at <lb/>
            Aegospotami, he passed round the coasts</p><pb n="41"/>
            
          <p>When they're in power, for they're the cheats themselves. <lb/>
            Much I omit. But if you pass my motion, <lb/>
            You'll lead the happiest lives that e'er you dreamed of.</p>
          <p>1st W. 0, good! Praxagora. Well done, sweet wench. <lb/>
            However did you learn to speak so finely ?</p>
          <p>PRAX. I and my husband in the general flight <lb/>
            Lodged in the Pnyx, and there I heard the speakers.</p>
          <p>1st W. Ah, you were clever to some purpose, dear. <lb/>
            And if you now succeed in your designs <lb/>
            We'll then and there proclaim you chieftainess. <lb/>
            But what if Cephalus, ill fare, insult you,</p>
          <p>and islands, and compelled all the Athe­ <lb/>
            nians he found, whether garrisons or <lb/>
            private individuals, to return to Athens <lb/>
            on pain of death; <foreign xml:lang="grc">συνήλαυνεν ἅπαντας εὶς <lb/>
            τὸ ἅστυ</foreign>, is Plutarch's expression (Ly­ <lb/>
            sander, 13); <foreign xml:lang="grc">ς</foreign>, says Xenophon, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὅτι, <lb/>

            of fugitives converging from all quarters <lb/>
            into Athens must have brought about a <lb/>
            situation very similar to that of B. C. 431. <lb/>
            It is to this immigration at the close, and <lb/>
            not to that at the beginning, of the Pelo­ <lb/>
            ponnesian War that Praxagora's state­ <lb/>

          <p>248. <foreign xml:lang="grc">κέΦαλος</foreign>] Now comes a little <lb/>
            scurrilous dialogue of twenty lines, criti­ <lb/>
            cizing some little-known speakers, and <lb/>
            making sundry jokes which the audience <lb/>
            may have relished, but which have no <lb/>
            interest for ourselves. We learn from <lb/>
            the present passage that this Cephalus <lb/>
            united the callings of a demagogue and <lb/>
            a potter: and be is doubtless the orator <lb/>
            of that name who is mentioned by Ando­ <lb/>
            cides, Deinarchus, and Demosthenes. <lb/>
            The Scholiast indeed says be is not; <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">δημαγωγὸς οὔτος ἔτερος, οὐχ δν λέγει Δημο­ <lb/>
            σθένης, ἀλλὰ λοίδορος</foreign> ;but I doubt if he <lb/>
            had any ground for his assertion except <lb/>
            that the orator is praised by Demo­ <lb/>
            sthenes. Yet so is Agyrrhius, see the <lb/>
            note on 102 supra; and apparently <lb/>
            the two are coupled together by Plato <lb/>
            Comicus; see Plutarch's Praecepta Ge­ <lb/>
            rendae Reipublicae, iv. <foreign xml:lang="grc">προσΦθαρεὶς</foreign> is <lb/>
            always used in a bad sense. Dr. Blaydes <lb/>
            aptly refers to Aelian (V. H. xiv. 26), who <lb/>
            says that a railing poet <foreign xml:lang="grc">έλοιρεῖτο</foreign> the <lb/>
            philosopher Arcesilaus, <foreign xml:lang="grc">προσΦθαρεὶς</foreign> airy. <lb/>
            So we are told that evil companions <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">προσΦθείρονται τῷ νεανίσκῳ</foreign> whom St. John <lb/>
            had committed to the charge of the Bp. <lb/>
            of Ephesus "in the sight of Christ and <lb/>
            His Church."—Eusebius, H. E. iii. 23. <lb/>
            The first two retorts of Praxagora rrapa­ <lb/>

          <p>sidered insufficient, since they merely <lb/>
            mention facts which all the citizens <lb/>
            know. Praxagora therefore tries a third, <lb/>
            viz. that he is a better politician than <lb/>
            potter. This they don't know, and her <lb/>

            ύπὸ</foreign> Tant <foreign xml:lang="grc">πλευραῖς πιήσω</foreign>. It means the <lb/>

          <p>261. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἤν αἴρωσ</foreign>'] This line, which is <lb/>
            usually given to one of the women on <lb/>
            the stage, I have transferred to the semi­ <lb/>
            chorus. If the archers lift her up bodily, <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">αἴρωσι</foreign>, sublimem rapiant, then, they say, <lb/>
            it will be OUR turn to act; then WE <lb/>
            will-Do what? Fling ourselves into <lb/>
            the fray? Fly to your rescue? Not <lb/>
            at all. We will bid them let you be. <lb/>
            The last two words are used 'rapa <foreign xml:lang="grc">προσ­ <lb/>

            mencement of the line gave promise of <lb/>
            some stern and vigorous resolve, and no <lb/>
            one could have supposed that they were <lb/>
            going to act after the manner of a tragic <lb/>
            Chorus; to utter helpless counsels and <lb/>
            unavailing admonitions and to leave <lb/>
            their leader to fight the battle by herself.</p><pb n="44"/>

            the Assembly was by show of hands, <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">χειμοτονία</foreign>, and Kuster observes that the <lb/>
            formula with which the <foreign xml:lang="grc">κῆρυξ</foreign> put the <lb/>
            question to the vote is preserved by the <lb/>
            Scholiast on Aesch. SuppL 629 '<foreign xml:lang="grc">Αράιω <lb/>

            passim. The double signification of ó <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἔτερος</foreign> one of the two and the other is <lb/>
            very neatly exemplified by a passage in <lb/>
            Lucian's Hermotimus (37). If there were <lb/>
            but two men in the temple, says Hermo­ <lb/>
            timus, when the sacred cup was stolen, <lb/>
            we must discover which of them has got <lb/>
            it, for certainly one of the two has it <foreign xml:lang="grc">όπό­ <lb/>
            τερος ἔχει τὴν Φιάλην, ἔχει δὲ πάντως ὁ <lb/>
            ἔτερος</foreign>. If then we find it on the first, <lb/>
            we shall not search the other <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸν ἔτερον</foreign>, <lb/>
            for evidently he has not got it; while if <lb/>
            we do not find it on the first, the other <lb/>
            has certainly got it <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὁ ἔτερος πάντως</foreign> ext. <lb/>
            Here we are told that beyond all doubt <lb/>
            6 <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἔτερος</foreign> (in the one sense) has it, and in <lb/>
            the same breath that whether <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὁ ἔτερος</foreign> <lb/>
            (in the other sense) has it or not, depends <lb/>
            upon the result of investigation. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐξω­ <lb/>

            the semichorus, gives them her final <lb/>
            injunctions as to the manner in which</p><pb n="45"/>
            
          <p>We lift our hands, and not our feet, in voting. <lb/>
            We're more for lifting feet than lifting hands.</p>
          <p>PRAX. A knotty point. However we must each <lb/>
            Hold up one arm, bare from the shoulder, so.</p>
          <p>Now then, my dears, tuck up your tunics neatly, <lb/>
            And slip your feet in those Laconian shoes, <lb/>
            Just as ye've seen your husbands do, whenever <lb/>
            They're going out, mayhap to attend the Assembly. <lb/>
            And next, so soon as everything is right <lb/>
            With shoes and tunics, fasten on your beards, <lb/>
            And when ye've got them neatly fitted on, <lb/>
            Then throw your husbands' mantles over all, <lb/>
            Those which ye stole; and leaning on your sticks <lb/>
            Off to the meeting, piping as ye go <lb/>
            Some old man's song, and mimicking the ways <lb/>
            Of country fellows. 1st W. Good I but let ourselves <lb/>
            Get on before them : other women soon</p>
          <p>they are to wear their husbands' clothes, <lb/>
            and march off to attend the Assembly. <lb/>
            They are to gather up the long body­ <lb/>
            robe, which being the husband's would <lb/>
            probably be too long for the wife; and <lb/>
            over this to throw the himation or outer <lb/>
            mantle. They are to put on their bus­ <lb/>
            bands' red Laconian shoes and tie their <lb/>
            beards carefully round their chins, and <lb/>
            then to start off, leaning on their sticks <lb/>
            and singing in chorus some favourite <lb/>
            old song. As we listen to her words, <lb/>
            we seem to catch a vivid glimpse of <lb/>
            the streets of old Athens in the early <lb/>
            morning, with groups of citizens and <lb/>
            yeomen marching along them, some to <lb/>
            the dicasteries (Wasps 219 and note <lb/>
            there), and others to the Assembly, <lb/>
            Is stout-hearted citizens singing one <lb/>
            song."</p>
          <p>280. <foreign xml:lang="grc">προἴμεν αὐτῶν</foreign>] The semichorus <lb/>
            are ready to start, and the first woman <lb/>
            says " Let us [that is, the three leaders] <lb/>
            go on before them." Meineke strangely <lb/>
            observes " Non apparet quo pertineat <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">αὐτῶν</foreign>; ad rusticas illas, dices, quas in <lb/>
            sequentibus commemorat," and he pro­ <lb/>
            poses to amend the passage. I should <lb/>
            not have supposed that any person of <lb/>
            sound mind could have entertained so <lb/>
            absurd an opinion as that which Meineke <lb/>
            imputes to his readers had it not already <lb/>
            been propounded by Lenting, who says <lb/>
            " Eas mulieres dicit, quas inox dicit sese <lb/>

            referendum est." It is plain that both <lb/>
            Lenting and Meineke have altogether <lb/>
            failed to appreciate the proceedings <lb/>
            on the stage and in the orchestra.</p>

            without coming to the rendezvous to <lb/>
            which the twelve city dames had re­ <lb/>
            sorted. They do, indeed, pass through <lb/>
            the theatre, but without stopping, enter­ <lb/>
            ing no doubt from the eastern side, <lb/>
            as <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀπὸ ἀγρῦ</foreign>, and leaving by the western <lb/>

          <p>285. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὤρα προβαίνειν</foreign>] The first four <lb/>
            lines, iambic tetrameter catalectics, are <lb/>
            spoken by the coryphaeus, as the semi­ <lb/>
            chorus are about to move out of the <lb/>
            orchestra. This is the only instance, in <lb/>
            these comedies, of what is called a <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">Μετάστασις</foreign> (Pollux, iv. segm. 108), that <lb/>
            is to say, the temporary departure of <lb/>
            the Chorus in the middle of a play, <lb/>
            leaving the orchestra vacant till their <lb/>
            return. But it is found in the Helen <lb/>
            of Euripides, and some other tragic <lb/>

            to <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὀνομάζειν</foreign>, is sung by the semichorus <lb/>
            whom Praxagora has just been instruct­ <lb/>
            ing, and who, as we have seen, represent <lb/>
            the dwellers in the city. They are <lb/>
            following Praxagora and the two other <lb/>
            leaders to the Pnyx, and are chiefly <lb/>
            anxious, as we might have anticipated, <lb/>
            to avoid all suspicion of being women <lb/>
            dressed up as men. Hence they call <lb/>
            themselves by men's names, Charitimi­ <lb/>
            des and the like, not alluding to any <lb/>
            individuals of that name, any more than <lb/>
            Praxagora was, when she called one of <lb/>
            her friends, Ariphrades, supra 129. The <lb/>
            strophe consists of twenty-one lines, <lb/>
            the first being a compound iambo­ <lb/>
            trochaic, very similar to that discussed <lb/>
            in the note to Wasps 248, but with an <lb/>
            additional syllable at the end. The <lb/>
            other twenty lines are glyconic, fifteen <lb/>
            being acatalectic, and five (the fourth, <lb/>

            a syllable short. The acatalectic line <lb/>

            followed by a choriamb and an iamb, <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BELL_67_fig72.jpg"/></figure><lb/>
              | The catalectic line <lb/>
              is the same, with the final syllable <lb/>
              omitted. The last syllable of the <lb/>
              catalectic line may be either long or <lb/>
              short, and so in my opinion, notwith­ <lb/>
              standing the great authority of Dawes <lb/>
              and Gaisford to the contrary, may, <lb/>
              though very rarely, the last syllable <lb/>
              of the acatalectic be. In other words, <lb/>
              though the last foot of the acatalectic <lb/>
              is almost invariably an iamb, yet a <lb/>
              pyrrhic<figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BELL_67_fig73.jpg"/></figure> is not absolutely inadmis­ <lb/>
              sible. We have one instance in this very <lb/>
              strophe, where the sixth glyconic line <lb/>
              ends with <foreign xml:lang="grc">τρώβολον</foreign>, and the seventh <lb/>
              commences with a vowel, and another <lb/>
              in Peace 1351. It is possible however <lb/>
              that this licence is taken only at the <lb/>
              end of a paragraph, where there is a <lb/>
              natural pause. For other examples of <lb/>
              the same metre, Gaisford (Hephaestion, <lb/>
              chap. xi, note) refers to Knights 1111- <lb/>
              50, Peace 1329 to the end, Birds 1731- <lb/>
              41 and Frogs 450-3 and 456-9.</p>

            cedent to these words is of course very <lb/>
            common. Dawes refers to Peace 371 <lb/>

            their empire the Athenians grew so <lb/>
            listless about public affairs that a single <lb/>
            obol was insufficient to bring them to <lb/>
            the Pnyx: they preferred to lounge <lb/>

            slippers. He turns out to be Blepyrus, <lb/>

            ments have, as the spectators are aware, <lb/>
            been abstracted by his wife. We have <lb/>

          <p>BLEPYRUS. What's up? Where's my wife gone? Why bless the woman, <lb/>
            It's almost daybreak and she can't be found. <lb/>
            Here am I, taken with the gripes abed, <lb/>
            Groping about to find my overcloke <lb/>
            And shoes i' the dark; but hang it, they're gone too : <lb/>
            I could not find them anywhere. Meanwhile <lb/>
            Easums kept knocking hard at my back-door; <lb/>
            So on I put this kirtle of my wife's, <lb/>
            And shove my feet into her Persian slippers. <lb/>
            Whereas a convenient place ? or shall I say <lb/>
            All are alike convenient in the dark ? <lb/>
            No man can see me here, I am sure of that. <lb/>
            Fool that I was, worse luck, to take a wife <lb/>
            In my old age. Ought to be thrashed, I ought! <lb/>
            'Tis for no good. I warrant, that she's out <lb/>
            This time of night. However, I can't wait.</p>

          <p>throw round her. The particular: of a <lb/>
            woman's apparel are described in Thesm. <lb/>
            249-262. The diminutives used in refer­ <lb/>
            ence to Praxagora's robe are probably <lb/>
            designed to show how scanty it was <lb/>

            the way of passers-by. The Scholiast <lb/>
            explains it by <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐν ἐρημἰᾳ</foreign>. The words <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐδεὶς ὄψεται</foreign> two lines below are of course <lb/>

          <p>327. <foreign xml:lang="grc">τίς ἐστιν</foreign>;] Another door opens, <lb/>
            and another husband comes out. The <lb/>
            door is that which Praxagora " gently <lb/>
            scratched," supra 34, and the man is the <lb/>
            husband of the second woman. He, like <lb/>
            Blepyrus, has been left in a destitute <lb/>
            condition by the disappearance of his <lb/>
            ordinary garments; but not having the <lb/>
            same urgent reason for immediately <lb/>
            leaving his house, he has found time to <lb/>
            array himself in another tunic. He is <lb/>
            therefore unprepared for the sight of <lb/>
            Blepyrus, wrapped in Praxagora's yellow <lb/>
            robe, and is at first disposed to think <lb/>
            that Cinesias, notorious for having be­ <lb/>
            fouled a shrine of Hecate (Frogs 366 <lb/>

            to be thrown over, and not to form a <lb/>
            substitute for, the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἠμιδιπλοίδιον</foreign>. The <lb/>
            man's <foreign xml:lang="grc">χιτὼν</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἱμάτιον</foreign> corresponded <lb/>
            to the woman's <foreign xml:lang="grc">κροκωτὸς</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἔγκυκλον</foreign>. <lb/>
            Praxagora had abstracted both the <lb/>
            former articles, and left the latter in <lb/>
            their stead. Her <foreign xml:lang="grc">κροκωτὸς</foreign> was now <lb/>
            . adorning her husband's person; her <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἔγκυκλον</foreign> had been thrown over his bed, <lb/>

            the wild pear tree, which is called by <lb/>
            Linnaeus, and generally since his time, <lb/>
            pirus communis, but was formerly called <lb/>
            also pirus achras. The tree itself was by <lb/>
            the Greeks called indifferently <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἄχερδος</foreign> <lb/>

            form is invariably adopted by Theo­ <lb/>
            phrastus, who in his History of Plants <lb/>
            is constantly contrasting the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀχρὰς</foreign> with <lb/>

            And he brings forward the same six <lb/>
            trees in iv. 13 as illustrations of the <lb/>
            greater longevity of the wild species. <lb/>
            In i. 4 he observes that the fruit of a <lb/>
            wild tree is superior in quantity, but <lb/>
            inferior in quality, to that of the culti­ <lb/>
            vated, and he instances the <foreign xml:lang="grc">κότινος</foreign> and <lb/>
            the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὰχράς</foreign>. Again in ii. 2 he says that <lb/>
            trees propagated by slips retain their <lb/>
            quality, but those propagated by seeds <lb/>
            degenerate, as <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐκ τῶν ὰπίων</foreign> [<foreign xml:lang="grc">φύεται</foreign>] <foreign xml:lang="grc">μοχ­ <lb/>
            θηρὰ ἡ ἀχράς</foreign>. The wild-pear tree, the <lb/>
            mother of all the orchard and garden <lb/>
            varieties, is thorny," as is observed in <lb/>
            Miller and Martyn's Gardener's Dic­ <lb/>
            tionary, s.v. pyrus. And its thorny shoots <lb/>
            were by the ancient Greeks wattled into <lb/>
            fences and sometimes placed as a coping <lb/>
            on walls, to prevent any clambering over <lb/>
            from within or without. Thus, in Odyssey <lb/>
            xiv. 10 Eumaeus is described as having <lb/>
            built a stone wall and coped it with <lb/>
            wild-pear branches, <foreign xml:lang="grc">καὶ ἐθρίγκωϭεν ἀχέρ­ <lb/>
            δῳ</foreign>; where the Scholiast explains <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὰχέρδῳ</foreign> <lb/>
            by <foreign xml:lang="grc">τῇ ἀγρίᾳ ἀπίῳ</foreign>, and adds <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἔχουϭι δὲ αὗται <lb/>

            <foreign xml:lang="grc">γίνονται</foreign>. It is unlikely that Blepyrus is <lb/>
            alluding to this use of the wild-pear <lb/>
            tree : without any allusion of this kind, <lb/>
            the word has the double recommenda­ <lb/>
            tion of introducing the reference to <lb/>
            Thrasybulus, and permitting the forma­ <lb/>
            tion of the deme-name '<foreign xml:lang="grc">Αχραδούϭιος</foreign>.</p>
          <p>356. <foreign xml:lang="grc">θραϭύβουλος</foreign>] The Scholiast tells <lb/>
            us that Thrasybulus had promised to <lb/>
            speak against a proposed treaty with <lb/>
            Sparta, but being bribed by the Spar­ <lb/>
            tans excused himself on the ground of <lb/>
            a sudden indisposition brought on by <lb/>
            eating wild pears; <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὗτος ἀντιλέγειν μέλλων</foreign> <figure type="illustration">

              <foreign xml:lang="grc">λέγειν</foreign>. But it is plain from the language <lb/>
              of Aristophanes that the Scholiast has <lb/>
              got hold of the wrong end of the story ; <lb/>
              and that Thrasybulus was excusing him­ <lb/>
              self to the Lacedaemonians for having <lb/>
              broken his promise to them. It seems <lb/>
              probable that this incident occurred in <lb/>
              connexion with the Anti-Spartan League. <lb/>
              Thrasybulus may at first have agreed to</p><pb n="58"/>

            is more consonant with what we know <lb/>
            of his character) being on consideration <lb/>
            doubtful whether the alliance might not <lb/>
            be for the best interests of his country, <lb/>
            he did not deliver his speech, and gave <lb/>
            to the disappointed Lacedaemonians the <lb/>
            excuse which is mentioned in the text. <lb/>

            But there would be no point in an allu­ <lb/>
            sion of this kind; and to me it seems <lb/>
            obvious that the oath by Dionysus has <lb/>
            no more special reference to Thrasy­ <lb/>

            above; but like <foreign xml:lang="grc">Κοπρεαῖος</foreign>, supra 317, it <lb/>
            comes close to the name of a real Attic <lb/>
            deme, the '<foreign xml:lang="grc">Αχερδούϭιοι</foreign>. See Leake's <lb/>
            Catalogue of the Demi, Topography of <lb/>

          <p>the reading of one inferior MS. <foreign xml:lang="grc">τῶν κατὰ <lb/>

            of the diseases affecting that particular <lb/>
            portion of the human body. But even <lb/>

            Garlic is recommended by Galen (Dc <lb/>

            He recommends it for toothache, the <lb/>

            tooth, and says that it gets rid of warts <lb/>
            and tumours, and dries and cleanses <lb/>
            ulcers; but that if any of it drops on <lb/>
            the skin, it raises a blister. In accord­ <lb/>
            ance with this we read in Miller and <lb/>
            Martyn, “ The juice of every species of <lb/>
            spurge is so acrid that it corrodes and <lb/>
            ulcerates the body wherever it is ap­ <lb/>
            plied : so that it is seldom used in­ <lb/>
            ternally. Externally it is dropped on <lb/>
            warts and corns to remove them, and in <lb/>
            the hollow of a decayed tooth to remove <lb/>
            the pain by destroying the nerve." Suidas <lb/>

            was a man in want of warm clothing, <lb/>
            and sometimes in want of a warm bed. <lb/>
            His clothes on this occasion are so <lb/>
            scanty or so threadbare, that people <lb/>
            cannot perceive that he has any on. <lb/>
            For I take <foreign xml:lang="grc">γυμνὸς</foreign> to be used in its strict <lb/>

            (Pollux, ix. segm. 62) and apparently <lb/>
            elsewhere: but to four silver statera, <lb/>
            which were current in several Hellenic <lb/>
            states. Their value is extremely un­ <lb/>
            certain; and four staters have been <lb/>
            variously computed as worth from five <lb/>
            to fifteen shillings. Here they represent <lb/>
            the price of a new suit of clothes, his <lb/>
            need of which was manifest to all the <lb/>
            Assembly from the deplorable state of <lb/>
            his wardrobe. This is the salvation <lb/>
            which he requires, and he proceeds to <lb/>
            show how he hopes to obtain it. With <lb/>
            the words <foreign xml:lang="grc">δεόμενον σωτηρίας</foreign> in the pre­ <lb/>

            <foreign xml:lang="grc">άπονίψασθαι</foreign>, as we have seen in the <lb/>
            Wasps, being specially applicable to <lb/>
            the after-dinner wash. See the note <lb/>

            nothing certain about this Nausicydes, <lb/>
            but for the passage which Bentley (and <lb/>
            afterwards, but quite independently, <lb/>
            Bergler). has cited from Xenophon's <lb/>
            Memorabilia, ii. 7, where Socrates ob­ <lb/>
            . serves that Nausicydes had amassed <lb/>
            such a fortune from his dealings in <lb/>
            grain, <foreign xml:lang="grc">άπ' άλφιτοποιίας</foreign>, that he became <lb/>
            one of the wealthiest men in Athens, <lb/>
            and bad frequently to undertake, at his <lb/>
            own expense, some of those onerous <lb/>
            public duties which were known as <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">λειτουργίαι</foreign>. It was natural that a man <lb/>
            who had acquired such great riches in <lb/>
            such a trade should be accused, whether <lb/>
            justly or unjustly, of having made his <lb/>
            money by harsh and ungenerous deal­ <lb/>
            ing: and that is the innuendo in the <lb/>
            line before us, In which case the poor <lb/>
            would hate gaintd this benefit from <lb/>
            Nausicydes. The combination of <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἳνα</foreign> <lb/>
            with a past tense of the indicative must <lb/>
            not be overlooked, as implying that, <lb/>
            except by means of this compulsory <lb/>
            largest they would never gain any <lb/>
            benefit from Nausicydes; see supra 152, <lb/>
            Wasps 961. The construction is illus­ <lb/>
            trated by Bp. Monk on Eur. Hipp. 643 <lb/>
            with his usual clearness and accuracy. <lb/>
            The example usually given of it is Oed. <lb/>
            Tyr. 1386, where Oedipus says that had <lb/>
            it been possible, he would have destroyed <lb/>
            not merely his eyesight, but the fount of</p><pb n="67"/>
            
          <p>No more will pleurisy attack us then. <lb/>
            Let such as own no bedclothes and no bed, <lb/>
            After they've dined, seek out the furriers, there <lb/>
            To sleep; and whoso shuts the door against them <lb/>
            In wintry weather, shall be fined three blankets.</p>
          <p>BLEP. Well said indeed ; and never a man would dare <lb/>
            To vote against him, had he added this : <lb/>
            That all who deal in grain shall freely give <lb/>
            Three quarts to every pauper, or be hanged. <lb/>
            That good, at least, they'd gain from Nausicydes.</p>
          <p>CHR. Then, after him, there bounded up to speak <lb/>
            A spruce and pale-faced youth, like Nicias. <lb/>
            And he declared we ought to place the state <lb/>
            Into the hands of (whom do you think ?) the women !</p>

          <p>427. <foreign xml:lang="grc">εύπρεπὴς νεανίας</foreign>] Praxagora her­ <lb/>
            self is the third speaker, " a fair and <lb/>
            pleasant-looking youth," says Chremes, <lb/>
            little dreaming that he is describing <lb/>
            the wife of Blepyrus. She rises from <lb/>
            the strange and pallid crowd of whom <lb/>
            he has spoken before. Both the epithets <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">λευκὸς</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">εύπρεπὴς</foreign> are applied to the <lb/>
            effeminate Agathon in Thesm. 191,192.</p>

            manner in which the three orators as­ <lb/>
            cended the bema. Neocleides in his <lb/>

            ordinary word for an orator coming <lb/>
            forward to speak. See Thucydides, i. <lb/>
            67, 72, 79, 85, and-passim. Praxagora, <lb/>
            in the nervous excitement natural to <lb/>
            her position, <foreign xml:lang="grc">άνεπήεησε</foreign>, sprang up to it. <lb/>
            The Nicias to whom she is compared is <lb/>
            probably, as Paulmier suggested, the <lb/>
            grandson of the famous Nicias who fell <lb/>
            in Sicily. It is true that in his speech <lb/>
            " In the matter of the confiscation of <lb/>
            the goods of [Eucrates], the brother of <lb/>
            Nicias," Lysias speaks of the grandson <lb/>
            in a manner which shows that he must <lb/>
            still have been a mere lad at the date <lb/>
            of this play: but the present passage <lb/>
            does not, I think, imply that the Nicias <lb/>
            to whom it alludes had ever taken part <lb/>
            in the proceedings of the Assembly, <lb/>
            whilst it does certainly imply that his <lb/>
            good looks and graceful manners were <lb/>
            generally familiar to the audience. <lb/>
            One can imagine the agreeable surprise <lb/>
            it would be to the lad to be thus singled <lb/>
            out for a public compliment in the <lb/>

          <p>473. <foreign xml:lang="grc">λόγος</foreign> it. <foreign xml:lang="grc">τ</foreign>. X.] Perhaps I may be <lb/>
            allowed to repeat here a note of my <lb/>
            own, published many years ago, on <lb/>
            another passage of Aristophanes: <lb/>
            "When the contention between Poseidon <lb/>
            and Athenè for the patronage of Athens <lb/>
            was decided in favour of the latter, <lb/>
            Poseidon in anger imprecated per­ <lb/>
            petual <foreign xml:lang="grc">δυσβουλία</foreign> on the new city. Now <lb/>
            the decrees of deities were, like those <lb/>
            of the Medes and Persians, supposed to <lb/>
            be irreversible, even by themselves: <lb/>
            , what one god had done, no other, nor <lb/>
            even himself, could undo; but he could <lb/>
            virtually nullify the effect by a subse­ <lb/>
            quent decree. To use the language of <lb/>
            the Roman law, the remedy was obrogatio, <lb/>
            not abrogatio. Hera deprived Teiresias <lb/>
            of sight; Zeus could not restore it, but <lb/>
            he gave him the power of prophecy. <lb/>
            Neither could Apollo revoke the gift of <lb/>
            prophecy which he had bestowed upon <lb/>
            Cassandra, but he could nullify it by <lb/>
            making all men disbelieve her. And so <lb/>
            in the instance before us, Athenè could <lb/>
            not change the curse of perpetual <foreign xml:lang="grc">δυσ­ <lb/>
            βουλία</foreign>, but she could and did nullify its <lb/>
            effect by causing it always to have a <lb/>
            successful issue." <foreign xml:lang="grc">ϋέγεται</foreign>, says the <lb/>
            Scholiast here, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ο̄τε Ποσειδω̑ν κα ὶ 'Αθηνᾱ</foreign> <figure type="illustration">

            There is a legend of the olden time, <lb/>
            That all our foolish plans and vain conceits <lb/>

          <p><foreign xml:lang="grc">καὶ έπιτυγχάνειν</foreign>. And this is why <lb/>
            Chremes, in his prayer three lines below, <lb/>
            whilst invoking generally all the gods, <lb/>
            makes a special appeal to Pallas.</p>
          <p>477. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ίγίαινε</foreign>] Lucian composed a <lb/>
            treatise, Pro lapsu inter salutandum, <lb/>
            because he had given a friend the even­ <lb/>
            ing salutation <foreign xml:lang="grc">ύγίαινε</foreign>, instead of the <lb/>
            morning <foreign xml:lang="grc">χαι̑ρε</foreign>. But it is clear that no <lb/>
            such distinction existed in the time of <lb/>
            Aristophanes. And cf. Frogs 165. With <lb/>
            these words Chremes and Blepyrus re- <lb/>
            enter their respective houses, and after <lb/>
            a short pause, the Chorus are heard, <lb/>
            returning from the Assembly. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ίξίρχεται <lb/>

            returning from the Assembly. She is <lb/>
            still wearing her husband's garments, <lb/>

            no more of the two women who had <lb/>
            been her companions there before. And <lb/>
            nobody else comes on the stage until <lb/>

          <p>MOVE ON, dear friends, move on apace, for now we're very near the place</p>
          <p>From whence we started, when we went to join the men in Parliament.</p>
          <p>And there's the mansion, full in view, where dwells our lady chieftain, who</p>
          <p>The wise and noble scheme invented to which the state has just assented.</p>

          <p>their respective houses, twenty lines <lb/>

            made supra 246.</p>
          <p>503. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀλγου̑σιν</foreign>] The MSS. and editions <lb/>
            read <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἥκουσιν</foreign>, which is translated, and <lb/>
            taken by all commentators to mean, <lb/>
            praeserlim quum illae (the women who <lb/>
            enter with Praxagora) adveniant vestem <lb/>
            solitam jam pridem indutae. But the <lb/>
            Greek is not open to such an interpreta­ <lb/>
            tion, even if it were not perfectly plain <lb/>
            that Praxagora enters alone. In my <lb/>
            judgement the entire line is a mere gloss <lb/>
            which has pushed out, and stepped into <lb/>
            the place of, the original line; its <lb/>
            meaning being, that the women had, in <lb/>
            the first, instance, come on the stage <lb/>
            prepared with manly beards and manly <lb/>
            dresses; see 482 supra. Nevertheless, as <lb/>
            the original line is lost beyond hope of <lb/>
            recovery, I have thought it best to <lb/>
            adopt the ingenious suggestion made <lb/>
            by Professor Arthur Palmer in the <lb/>
            Quarterly Review of October, 1884, who <lb/>
            alters <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἥκουσιν</foreign> into <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀλγου̑σιν</foreign>, and refers <lb/>
            the preceding <foreign xml:lang="grc">χαὖται</foreign> to "the tender <lb/>
            cheeks of the delicate ladies, which <lb/>
            are tired of wearing the rough beards <lb/>
            so long." Praxagora now from the <lb/>
            stage addresses the Chorus in the <lb/>
            orchestra.</p><pb n="76"/>

            <foreign xml:lang="grc">σμευούσας τὰ ὑποδήματα</foreign> shows that he <lb/>
            rightly understood the meaning of <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἡνἱας</foreign>, <lb/>
            but <foreign xml:lang="grc">συναπτοὺς</foreign> signifies "fastened," not <lb/>
            " fastening." I take the whole line to <lb/>
            . be a quotation from Euripides or some <lb/>
            other tragic poet, which in the original <lb/>
            was a direction to some charioteer to <lb/>
            let loose the Spartan reins, and give the <lb/>
            horse its head, but is here diverted into <lb/>
            a pompous description of the shoe­ <lb/>
            latchets with which the " red Laco­ <lb/>
            nians" were tied. And this accounts <lb/>

            dialogue ensues between husband and <lb/>
            wife, leading up to the great debate of <lb/>
            the play. That the friend who occa­ <lb/>

            tolerant Chremes, I am quite convinced, <lb/>
            though he takes so little part in the <lb/>
            conversation, that the very presence of <lb/>
            a third person is ignored by some. It <lb/>
            is, however, conclusively proved by lines <lb/>
            569, 570 infra, and by the use of the</p><pb n="78"/>

            disputants. As a rule be addresses <lb/>
            himself to Blepyrus, and speaks of <lb/>
            Praxagora in the third person. In the <lb/>
            following line <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὡς εὐηθικω̑ς</foreign> means what <lb/>
            a remarkably silly question !</p>
          <p>522. <foreign xml:lang="grc">παρὰ του̑ μοιχου̑</foreign>] The definite <lb/>
            article has given some trouble, as seem­ <lb/>
            ing to imply that Praxagora possessed <lb/>
            a lover. But even if this were the true <lb/>
            .interpretation it need not cause any <lb/>
            surprise, since in these opening lines <lb/>
            Praxagora is playfully making sugges­ <lb/>
            tions against herself, which, her hus­ <lb/>
            band is well aware, have no foundation <lb/>
            in fact. But in reality there is no such <lb/>
            implication; she is merely putting <lb/>
            words into her husband's lips: " You <lb/>
            will not say to me, as some husbands <lb/>
            might justly say to their wives, you are <lb/>

            being cold, Blepyrus had cast his <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἱμάτιον</foreign> <lb/>

          <p>547. <foreign xml:lang="grc">πυρω̑ν ἑκτέα</foreign>] An <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἑκτεὺς</foreign> was the <lb/>
            sixth part of a medimnus. And as <lb/>
            Blepyrus means that the triobol which <lb/>
            he would have earned by attending <lb/>
            the Assembly, would have purchased <lb/>
            an <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἑκτεὺς</foreign> of wheat, it follows that a <lb/>
            medimnus of wheat would cost about <lb/>
            18 obols, or 3 drachmas. And Boeckh <lb/>
            (Public Economy of Athens, i. 15), <lb/>
            comparing the various data which bear <lb/>
            on the subject, comes to the conclusion <lb/>
            that this would in fact have been the <lb/>
            price of a medimnus of wheat at the <lb/>
            time of this play. Blepyrus has sum­ <lb/>

            And striking down your staff against the stones.</p>
          <p>BLEP. You've lost eight quarts of wheat, I'd have you know, <lb/>
            Which the Assembly would have brought me in.</p>

          <p>551. <foreign xml:lang="grc">γεγένηται</foreign>] Has there been an <lb/>
            Assembly to-day ? <foreign xml:lang="grc">προσποιουμένη</foreign>, says <lb/>
            the Scholiast, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐ</foreign>p<foreign xml:lang="grc">ωτα̜̑ ἐπίτηδες εἰ γέγονεν <lb/>
            ἡ ἐκκλησια, ὡς ἀγνοου̑σα</foreign>. We must <lb/>
            assume it to hare been not one of <lb/>
            the ordinary Assemblies, but one con­ <lb/>
            voked for the special purpose of con­ <lb/>
            sidering what steps should be taken <lb/>
            for the safety of the state, supra 396.</p>
          <p>554. <foreign xml:lang="grc">κάθησο κ.τ.λ</foreign>.] The cuttle seems <lb/>
            to have been a favourite article of diet <lb/>
            with Athenian women: and although <lb/>
            now, I believe, altogether banished <lb/>
            from English tables, it was not always <lb/>
            so. "The cuttle,”says Lord Bacon, <lb/>
            .. is a delicate meat, and is much in <lb/>
            request.”—Nat.Hist. 742. The Scholiast's <lb/>
            explanation, <foreign xml:lang="grc">οἶον ἐντρυΦω̑σα διὰ τὴν <lb/>
            ἐξουσίαν</foreign>, is followed by all the commen­ <lb/>
            tators, who adopt Le Fevre's translation, <lb/>
            "sede, et in posterum laute ac beate <lb/>
            vivito; tibi enim magnum imperium <lb/>

            would require <foreign xml:lang="grc">γὰρ</foreign>, not <foreign xml:lang="grc">δὲ</foreign>, in the follow­ <lb/>
            ing line, and is, in my judgement, <lb/>
            altogether erroneous. Praxagora has re­ <lb/>
            presented herself as completely wrapped <lb/>
            up in domestic affairs, and ignorant of <lb/>
            all that has passed in the public <lb/>
            Assembly. Blepyrus is glorying in his <lb/>
            superior knowledge. Sit you down, he <lb/>
            says, scornfully, and che<unclear/> cuttlefish with <lb/>
            your gossips. You do not know, as I do, <lb/>

            . whereas she had merely enunciated a <lb/>
            categorical proposition, it will not be <lb/>
            open to them to do so. Praxagora dis­ <lb/>
            dains to notice his interruption, and <lb/>
            yet it affects her own language, making <lb/>
            her substitute the dependent negative <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">μὴ</foreign> for the absolute negative <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐ</foreign>. " Pergit <lb/>

          <p>571. <foreign xml:lang="grc">νυ̑ν δὴ δεί</foreign>] The time for expound­ <lb/>
            ing the principles of the <foreign xml:lang="grc">γυναικοκρατία</foreign> <lb/>
            has arrived: and the Chorus greet their <lb/>
            chieftainess with a little song of advice <lb/>
            and encouragement; the strophe, pro­ <lb/>
            bably, to an antistrophe which has <lb/>
            dropped out after line 729 infra. It <lb/>
            consists of eighteen lines, all but four <lb/>
            of which are composed of a choriamb <lb/>
            and an Ionic a minore. The Ionic is <lb/>
            twice shorn of its final syllable, and so <lb/>
            . becomes an anapaest, and once of its <lb/>
            first syllable, and so becomes a bacchic <lb/>
            foot. Also the first line has a dissyllabic, <lb/>
            and the fourth a monosyllabic, base. <lb/>
            And of course in all non-continuous <lb/>
            metres the final syllable may be either <lb/>
            long or short: <foreign xml:lang="grc">παντὸς μέτρου ἀδιάφορός <lb/>

            είναι αύτήν καί βραχείαν καί μακράν</foreign> — <lb/>
            Hephaestion, iv. 2. Of the four remain­ <lb/>
            ing lines, the fifth, eighth, and eleventh <lb/>
            are trochaic dipodies; whilst the final <lb/>
            line has an additional trochaic foot, <lb/>
            and is therefore a trochaic dimeter <lb/>
            brachycatalectic. The metrical scheme <lb/>
            of the chorus is set out in the Appendix. <lb/>
            The first line appears in the MSS. as <lb/>

            to the sense, and destructive to the <lb/>

          <p>CHOR. Now waken your intellect bright, <lb/>
            Your soul philosophic, that knows <lb/>
            So well for your comrades to fight. <lb/>
            For all to our happiness goes <lb/>
            The project your tongue will disclose, <lb/>
            As with thousands of joys you propose <lb/>
            The citizen life to endow. <lb/>
            Now show us what things you can do! <lb/>
            It is time; for the populace now <lb/>
            Requires an original new <lb/>
            Experiment; only do you <lb/>
            Some novelty bring from your store <lb/>
            Never spoken or done heretofore. <lb/>
            The audience don't like to be cheated <lb/>
            With humours too often repeated.</p>

            retained in the translation.</p>
          <p>573. <foreign xml:lang="grc">κοινη̑ γάρ</foreign>] The Chorus are ex­ <lb/>
            plaining why they had used the words <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ταῖσι φίλαισιν ὰμύνειν</foreign> “ We say to assist <lb/>
            your friends, for you are not acting for <lb/>
            yourself only: it is for the cause of <lb/>
            Womanhood in general that the scheme <lb/>
            which you are about to expound is set <lb/>
            in motion (literally, the scheme of your <lb/>
            tongue is proceeding), embellishing the <lb/>
            civic populace with ten thousand bless­ <lb/>
            ings of life. You are fighting the battle <lb/>
            of us all."</p>
          <p>576. <foreign xml:lang="grc">δηλου̑ν... δύνασαι</foreign>] Show what thou <lb/>
            const do. The infinitive is here, as con­ <lb/>
            stantly elsewhere, employed for the <lb/>
            imperative, <foreign xml:lang="grc">χρὴ</foreign> or some such word <lb/>
            being understood.</p>
          <p>580. TO <foreign xml:lang="grc">παλαιὰ πολλάκις</foreign>] There is <lb/>
            doubtless here a covert reflection upon <lb/>
            the poet's rivals, with whose constant <lb/>
            harping on the self-same topics he is <lb/>
            fond of contrasting his own boundless <lb/>
            variety and originality. " Unlike them." <lb/>
            he says in the Clouds, " I am <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀεὶ καινάς<lb/>
            ίδέας είσ</foreign>ф<foreign xml:lang="grc">έρων, ούδέν άλλήλαισινι όμοίας καί<lb/>
            πάσας δεξιάς</foreign>.”-Clouds 547, 548. " You <lb/>
            should love and cherish a poet," he <lb/>
            says in the Wasps, " who is ever seeking <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">καινόν τι λέγειν κἀξευρίσκειν</foreign>.” — Wasps <lb/>
            1053. And compare the opening scene <lb/>
            of the Frogs. He was probably unjust <lb/>
            to his rivals, but that his own self-praise <lb/>
            was justified, the existing comedies <lb/>
            abundantly testify. If the entire sen­ <lb/>
            tence from <foreign xml:lang="grc">μισου̑σι</foreign> to <foreign xml:lang="grc">θεῶνται</foreign> were read <lb/>
            as one line, as it is by Brunck and the <lb/>
            older editors, it would be in the same <lb/>
            metre as the concluding lines of the <lb/>
            Wasps. See the note on Wasps 1518.</p><pb n="86"/>

              With the expression <foreign xml:lang="grc">χαρίτων μετέχει <lb/>

            in the merits of her case, but fears that <lb/>
            the audience may not approve of so <lb/>
            novel a scheme, <foreign xml:lang="grc">τοὺς θεατὰς</foreign> is the ac­ <lb/>
            cusative placed before the conjunction, <lb/>
            instead of the nominative placed after <lb/>
            it. So Birds 652, 653, 1269, 1270 and <lb/>
            passim. And compare such passages as <lb/>
            that in Romeo and Juliet, iv. 2, <lb/>
            Now, afore God, this reverend holy friar, <lb/>
            All our. whole city is much bound to him. <lb/>
            Throughout the ensuing discussion, the <lb/>
            long Aristophanics of the text are in <lb/>
            the translation unworthily represented <lb/>
            by anapaestic dimeters, in which many <lb/>
            lines are omitted, and a few added, and <lb/>
            which generally aim at giving rather <lb/>
            the spirit of the argument than a literal <lb/>
            rendering of the words. At the time <lb/>
            they were written it was supposed that <lb/>
            in this play, as in the Lysistrata and <lb/>
            the Thesmophoriazusae, it would be <lb/>
            necessary to leave such large blanks in <lb/>
            the translation as would unfit it for <lb/>
            appearing in juxtaposition with the <lb/>
            Greek, and consequently various liber­ <lb/>
            ties were taken, for which it is hoped <lb/>
            that these considerations may be ac­ <lb/>
            cepted as an adequate apology.</p>
          <p>584. <foreign xml:lang="grc">καινοτομεῖν</foreign>] It must have been <lb/>
            sufficiently diverting to an Athenian <lb/>
            audience to hear themselves described <lb/>
            as too fond of standing in the old ways, <lb/>
            and impatient of everything novel and <lb/>
            untried. For of course, as Blepyrus <lb/>
            immediately reminds his wife, their dis­ <lb/>
            tinguishing characteristic throughout <lb/>
            all their history was their inexhaustible <lb/>
            love of novelty and change. This indeed <lb/>
            was their very reason for adopting <lb/>
            Praxagora's revolutionary scheme,</p><pb n="87"/>
            
          <p>So come to the point, and at once: for delay <lb/>
            Is a thing the spectators detest in a play.</p>
          <p>PRAX. I've an excellent scheme, if you will but believe it; <lb/>
            But I cannot be sure how our friends will receive it; <lb/>
            Or what they will do, if the old I eschew, <lb/>
            And propound them a system erratic and new. <lb/>
            This makes me a trifle alarmed and faint-hearted.</p>
          <p>BLEP. As to that, you may safely be fearless and bold : <lb/>
            We adore what is new, and abhor what is old. <lb/>
            This rule we retain when all else has departed.</p>

              of the Mitylenaeans, says that the <lb/>

            TO <foreign xml:lang="grc">καινοτομεῖν</foreign>, as the Scholiast rightly <lb/>
            explains it. The speaker is playing on <lb/>
            the words <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀρχη̑ς</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀρχαίων</foreign>. They have <lb/>
            lost their fair empire, the <foreign xml:lang="grc">καλὴν ἀρχὴν</foreign> <lb/>
            of which Aristophanes speaks in the <lb/>
            Knights (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ὠ Δη̑με, καλήν γ</foreign>’ <foreign xml:lang="grc">ε̃χεις ἀρχὴν</foreign>), <lb/>
            and now their only substitute is <foreign xml:lang="grc">καινοτο­ <lb/>

          <p>588. <foreign xml:lang="grc">μήνυν κ.τ.λ</foreign>.] Praxagora. hitherto <lb/>
            a mere innocent-inquirer, proceeds to <lb/>
            develop her scheme with the air and <lb/>
            authority of a lawgiver. Yet she has <lb/>
            not told her husband that she had been <lb/>
            the leader of the movement, or the <lb/>
            speaker in the Assembly, or that she is <lb/>
            the elected chieftainess of the New <lb/>
            Republic. Aristophanes seems to have <lb/>
            thought this unnecessary ; the audience <lb/>
            knew it, and that was enough for his <lb/>
            purpose. It is not until the discussion <lb/>
            has closed that she mentions, and then <lb/>
            only incidentally (infra 714), that she <lb/>
            is now the ruler of the state. At the <lb/>
            outset she stipulates that nobody shall <lb/>
            gainsay or interrupt her, so that her <lb/>
            entire plan may be presented to her <lb/>
            audience before the heckling begins. <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὑποκρούειν</foreign> is the regular word for inter- ! <lb/>
            rupting a speaker. Cf. supra 256, infra <lb/>
            596, Ach. 38. So in Lucian's Toxaris, <lb/>
            the Hellenic speaker, having been al­ <lb/>
            lowed to finish his own speech without <lb/>
            interruption, begins at once to interpose <lb/>
            in the Scythian's reply. And the latter <lb/>
            says, <foreign xml:lang="grc">όρα̜ς, τοῖτο ω̒ς ἐριστικὸν ποιεῖς καὶ</foreign> </p><pb n="88"/>

          <p>589. <foreign xml:lang="grc">του̑ φράζοντος</foreign>] She uses the mas­ <lb/>
            culine because, as Bergler observes, she <lb/>
            is enunciating a general maxim, Oratori <lb/>
            auscultandum. She means, of course, <lb/>
            " Listen to me,” but she puts it in the <lb/>
            form of a general rule, " Listen to the <lb/>
            speaker."</p>
          <p>590. <foreign xml:lang="grc">Κοινωνεῖν</foreign>] The first word of <lb/>
            Praxagora's address strikes the keynote <lb/>
            of the scheme she is about to propose, <lb/>
            a scheme which aims at making a clean <lb/>
            sweep of the existing order of things, <lb/>
            social as well as political, and setting <lb/>
            up in its place a system of pure un­ <lb/>
            adulterated communism, under the con­ <lb/>
            trol of the women. This is the more <lb/>
            surprising, because the special qualifica­ <lb/>
            tion put forward by the women in their <lb/>
            bid for power is the intense innate con­ <lb/>
            servatism of their sex (supra 215-238), <lb/>
            . as contrasted with the incessant craving <lb/>
            for novelty and change exhibited by <lb/>
            the men. But the theories of Plato, <lb/>
            which we now find embodied in the <lb/>
            Fifth Book of his Republic, were begin­ <lb/>
            ning to attract very general attention; <lb/>
            and Aristophanes, having gone so far <lb/>
            on one tack, suddenly finds before him <lb/>
            a unique opportunity for bringing those <lb/>
            theories into ridicule and caricature; <lb/>
            and, unable to resist the temptation, he <lb/>
            throws to the winds the consistency of <lb/>
            his plot. Some remarks on this subject <lb/>
            will be found in the Introduction to the <lb/>
            play.</p>
          <p>592. <foreign xml:lang="grc">μηδὲ ταφη̑ναι</foreign>] These words occur <lb/>
            again in Plutus 556, where Poverty says <lb/>
            that a poor man's lot is “ for ever to toil <lb/>
            and to slave At Poverty's call: and to leave <lb/>
            after all not even enough for a grave,” <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">καταλείψει, μηδὲ ταφη̑ναι</foreign>. There, however, <lb/>
            the reference is to the cost of the <lb/>
            funeral; here, to the ground required <lb/>
            for the interment.</p>

            And weigh and perpend, till you quite comprehend, <lb/>
            The drift and intent of the scheme I present. <lb/>
            The rule which I dare to enact and declare, <lb/>
            Is that all shall be equal, and equally share <lb/>
            All wealth and enjoyments, nor longer endure <lb/>
            That one should be rich, and another be poor, <lb/>
            That one should have acres, far-stretching and wide, <lb/>
            And another not even enough to provide <lb/>
            Himself with a grave: that this at his call <lb/>
            Should have hundreds of servants, and that none at all. <lb/>
            All this I intend to correct and amend : <lb/>
            Now all of all blessings shall freely partake, <lb/>

            five lines, when her husband strikes in <lb/>
            with a quite unnecessary question. This <lb/>
            so exasperates the lady that she hurls <lb/>
            at his head a slang expression of abuse, <lb/>
            You shall eat muck before I do. Blepyrus <lb/>
            affects to suppose this to be part of <lb/>
            her scheme, and innocently inquires <lb/>
            whether her communistic system extends <lb/>
            to the muck, so that she will share it <lb/>
            with him. No, she says, but you were <lb/>
            too quick with your interruption; you <lb/>
            forestalled me by breaking in upon my <lb/>

            The Darics are the famous gold coins of <lb/>

            comparison made by Greek writers <lb/>

              time. When Xerxes was marching to <lb/>
              the invasion of Hellas, a Lydian named <lb/>
              Pythius entertained the king and his <lb/>
              whole army, and afterwards offered all <lb/>
              his wealth (other than his land and the <lb/>
              slaves who tilled it) to fill the coffers of <lb/>
              the king. That wealth consisted of a <lb/>
              vast amount of silver, and four million <lb/>
              (all but 7,000) Darics of gold. Xerxes, <lb/>
              instead of taking the money, added the <lb/>
              7,000 Darics required to complete the <lb/>
              four millions (Hdt. vii 27-80). On a <lb/>
              smaller scale is the anecdote of the <lb/>
              Asiatic who endeavoured to bribe the <lb/>
              Athenian Cimon by giving him two <lb/>

            Daniel; and this is likely enough, <lb/>

            with the slight alterations made above <lb/>
            in the text, all difficulty appears to be <lb/>

            then return to the question of the com­ <lb/>
            munity of goods. The subject now <lb/>
            broached, however, reappears in Praxa­ <lb/>
            gora's peroration, infra 693-709; and <lb/>
            again in the scene of the three hags, <lb/>
            infra 877-1111.</p>
          <p>612. <foreign xml:lang="grc">τούτων</foreign>] That is, of his own private <lb/>
            property, which he has not brought into <lb/>
            the public stores. But the commen­ <lb/>
            tators have strangely misconceived the <lb/>
            meaning of the latter part of the line. <lb/>
            Dr. Blaydes renders it" Postquam autem <lb/>
            cum ilia dormirerit, communium partici­ <lb/>
            pabit; et tantum inde argenti sumet <lb/>
            quantum puellae donavcrit." And he <lb/>
            adds “Assumtum Blepyri hoc est: Si quis <lb/>
            puellam formosam viderit, pecunia ei <lb/>
            numerata vel praesenti (ut dicitur) opus <lb/>

            tantundem mox ex acervo recupera­ <lb/>

            the passage. The words <foreign xml:lang="grc">τῶν ἐκ κοινου̑</foreign> <lb/>
            are a mere piece of flippancy on the <lb/>
            part of Blepyrus, meaning "the plea­ <lb/>
            sures they will share together," or in <lb/>
            other words " the pleasures of love."</p>
          <p>614. <foreign xml:lang="grc">κοινάς</foreign>] This is, in truth, the very <lb/>

            If you know any reason, I hope you'll explain.</p>
          <p>BLEP. 'Tis those that have most of these goods, I believe, <lb/>
            That are always the worst and the keenest to thieve.</p>

            In your old-fashioned system, abolished at last; <lb/>

            When all things are common, I'd have you explain.</p>
          <p>BLEP. If a youth to a girl his devotion would show, <lb/>
            He surely must woo her with presents. PRAX. 0 no. <lb/>

            To the girl that is fairest, what then will be done?</p>
          <p>PRAX. By the side of the beauty, so stately and grand, <lb/>

            entirety, unless, indeed, it was intro­ <lb/>
            duced into Persia by the fanatic Maz­ <lb/>
            dak in the sixth century of our era ; <lb/>
            see Gibbon'a Decline and Fall, chap. <lb/>

            problem here raised must frequently <lb/>
            have been faced in Ceylon, Tibet, and <lb/>
            other Asiatic regions, where women are <lb/>
            the polygamists. " The choice of a <lb/>
            wife," says Mr. Andrew Wilson in his <lb/>
            interesting work on Tibet, " is the <lb/>
            right of the elder brother; and among <lb/>
            all the Tibetan-speaking people it uni­ <lb/>
            versally prevails that the contract he <lb/>

            contract with all the other brothers if <lb/>
            they choose to avail themselves of it." <lb/>
            Consequently there is sometimes but <lb/>
            one wife between five or six brothers. <lb/>

            All youths will in common be sons of the old.</p>

            Pray what will become of the agèd and weak ? <lb/>
            At present I own, though a father be known, <lb/>
            Sons throttle and choke him with hearty goodwill; <lb/>
            But will they not do it more cheerily still, <lb/>
            When the sonship is doubtful ? PRAX. No, certainly not.</p>
          <p>the strong family feeling prevailing <lb/>
            amongst them “ prevents any difficulty <lb/>
            arising in connexion with the children, <lb/>
            who are regarded as scions of the house <lb/>
            rather than of one particular member <lb/>
            of it." " There is no noticeable differ­ <lb/>
            ence in the relationship of a child <lb/>
            to his different fathers." The surplus <lb/>
            women are provided for in the Lamian <lb/>
            nunneries. See Andrew Wilson's The <lb/>
            Abode of Snow, chapter xxxv. These <lb/>
            customs prevail even among the Tibetan <lb/>

            Gallico, v. 14, where it is said that <lb/>
            a somewhat similar custom existed <lb/>
            amongst the ancient Britons, a little <lb/>
            group of ten or twelve having their <lb/>
            wires in common. To some extent also, <lb/>
            under the laws of Lycurgus, the like <lb/>
            question must have arisen in Sparta.— <lb/>

            Hitherto, she argues, if a son assaulted <lb/>

            it was not their own father who was <lb/>

            new system, the victim may, for aught <lb/>
            they know, be their own father, and <lb/>
            they will at once interpose. Praxagora <lb/>

            the Scholiast of the two former; and <lb/>

            curus and Leucolophus we know nothing <lb/>
            further: though looking to the Athenian <lb/>
            habit of naming children after their <lb/>
            grandfathers, some may conjecture that <lb/>
            the former was the grandfather of the <lb/>

            son of the traitor Adeimantus. See <lb/>
            Frogs 1513. Aristyllus, however, is <lb/>
            again mentioned in Plutus 314, and <lb/>
            that in a way which enables us to <lb/>
            understand why a kiss from his lips <lb/>

            on some occasion or other, been <lb/>
            smothered over with dung. Cario has <lb/>

          <p>BLEP. In much that you say there is much to admire; <lb/>
            But what if Leucolophus claim me for sire, <lb/>
            Or vile Epicurus ? I think you'll agree <lb/>
            That a great and unbearable nuisance 'twould be.</p>

          <p>BLEP. How so ? CHR. If the skunk Aristyllus should call you <lb/>

          <p>wealth is within, and will speedily turn <lb/>
            them all into rich and leisured men. The <lb/>
            Chorus are not slow in expressing their <lb/>
            surprise and delight at the prospect:- <lb/>
            CHORUS. He says we'll all be wealthy now : upon my word this passes, airs. <lb/>

            If what you say is really true, and not your own frivolity. <lb/>
            Thereupon they break out into a rustic <lb/>

            the comrades of Odysseus, chasing Cario, <lb/>

            Who late in Corinth, as I've learned, Philonides's comrades turned <lb/>
            To loathsome swine in a loathsome sty, <lb/>
            And fed them all on kneaded dung which, kneading, the amongst them flung; <lb/>
            And turn you all into swine will L <lb/>
            And then ye’ll grunt in your bestial glee, <lb/>
            Wee I wee I wee I <lb/>
            Follow your mother, pigs I quoth she. <lb/>
            CHORUS. We'll catch you, Circe dear, we will; who mix your drugs with baleful skill : <lb/>
            Who with enchantments strange and vile ensnare our comrades and defile. <lb/>
            We'll hang you up, as you erst were hung <lb/>
            By bold Odysseus, lady fair; and then, as if a goat you were, <lb/>
            We'll rub your nose in the kneaded dung. <lb/>
            Like Aristyllus, you'll gape with glee, <lb/>
            Wee I wee ! wee I <lb/>
            Follow your mother, pigs I quoth he.</p>

            -<foreign xml:lang="grc">μίνθης</foreign>, with greater emphasis. For <lb/>
            undoubtedly, as Dr. Blaydes observes, <lb/>
            -<foreign xml:lang="grc">μίνθης</foreign> is intended to remind the au­ <lb/>
            dience of the <foreign xml:lang="grc">μίνθος</foreign> with which the <lb/>
            face of Aristyllus was bedaubed. The <lb/>
            reference to Aristyllus in the passage <lb/>
            translated in the preceding note is:— <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BELL_67_fig128.jpg"/></figure> <lb/>
              If Aristyllus presses his face to yours, <lb/>
              you will certainly be smelling of u<foreign xml:lang="grc">ίνθος</foreign>. <lb/>
              The old grammarians thought that <lb/>
              there must be some connexion between <lb/>
              the words <foreign xml:lang="grc">μίνθος</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">μίνθη</foreign>. The author <lb/>
              of the EtymoL Magn. s. v. <foreign xml:lang="grc">μίνθη</foreign>, after <lb/>
              describing <foreign xml:lang="grc">μίνθη</foreign> as a sweet-smelling <lb/>
              herb, adds <foreign xml:lang="grc">μήποτ</foreign>’<foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐν ἡμεῖς μίνθον κατὰ <lb/>

              chius under the one title <foreign xml:lang="grc">μίνθα</foreign> has <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸ <lb/>
              ἡδύομον καί ἀνθρωπεία κόπρος</foreign>. And the <lb/>
              Scholiast on Plutus 313 appears to think <lb/>
              that <foreign xml:lang="grc">μίνθη</foreign> derives its name because it is <lb/>
              an <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἅνθος ἐν τη̑ κόπρῳ Φυόμενον</foreign>.</p>

            loved to cultivate their own lands, <lb/>
            though of course with the assistance of <lb/>
            numerous slaves, is plain, as from other <lb/>
            authorities, so from countless passages <lb/>
            in the plays of Aristophanes; especially <lb/>
            the Acharnians and the Peace. In the <lb/>
            latter play, as indeed in the Plutus, <lb/>
            the Chorus consists of free Athenian <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">γεωργοί</foreign>.</p>
          <p>652. <foreign xml:lang="grc">δεκάπουν</foreign>] When the (shad<foreign xml:lang="grc">οιο</foreign> of <lb/>
            the) gnomon is ten feet long, that is to <lb/>
            say, rather more than half an hour <lb/>
            before sunset. In the primitive dials of <lb/>
            which Aristophanes is speaking the <lb/>
            hour was determined not by the direc­ <lb/>
            tion, but by the length of the shadow. <lb/>
            And according to the most careful <lb/>
            observation which I have been able to <lb/>
            make or procure, an object casts a <lb/>
            shadow of " over twenty-two " times its <lb/>
            own height at sunset, and a shadow of <lb/>
            ten times its own height about thirty­ <lb/>
            one minutes earlier. It is plain there­ <lb/>
            fore that the gnomon or (as we are <lb/>
            accustomed to call it) index of an <lb/>
            Athenian dial was one foot in height, <lb/>
            rising vertically from the ground. Dials <lb/>
            of this kind are frequently mentioned <lb/>
            by the ancient writers. Thus Eubulus <lb/>
            (apud Ath. i. 14) tells a story of a para­ <lb/>
            site who, being asked to supper when <lb/>
            the shadow was twenty feet long, that <lb/>
            is, just before sunset, ó<foreign xml:lang="grc">πηνίκ</foreign>’ <foreign xml:lang="grc">άν Εϊκοσι</foreign> </p><pb n="101"/>
            
          <p>PRAX. But this, sir, is nonsense: it never could be. <lb/>
            That whelp was begotten before the Decree. <lb/>
            His kiss, it is plain, you can never obtain.</p>
          <p>BLEP. The prospect I view with disgust and alarm. <lb/>
            But who will attend to the work of the farm ?</p>
          <p>PRAX. All labour and toil to your slaves you will leave; <lb/>
            Your business 'twill be, when the shadows of eve <lb/>
            Ten feet on the face of the dial are cast, <lb/>
            To scurry away to your evening repast.</p>
          <p>BLEP. Our clothes, what of them ? PRAX. You have plenty in store, <lb/>
            When these are worn out, we will weave you some more.</p>

            Come sup to-morrow, says a friend, <lb/>
            When tuenty feet the shades extend. <lb/>
            He rises up before the lark, <lb/>
            And runs the dial's face to mark. <lb/>
            Lo, when the sun appears in view, <lb/>
            The shade is over twenty-two. <lb/>
            Off to his friend's at once he hies, <lb/>
            And, Sorry I'm so late, he cries, <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">᾽Τ</foreign>uas urgent business made me stay. <lb/>
            This, though he came with break of day. <lb/>
            The expression " Over twenty-two" is <lb/>
            quite accurate: the shadow beyond that <lb/>
            distance becomes imperceptible to the <lb/>
            naked eye. Menander's parasite (apud <lb/>
            Ath. vi. 42) measured the shadow on his <lb/>
            dial by moonlight : <figure type="illustration">

              So in Lucian's Gallus, 9, a poor man, <lb/>
              asked out to supper, is described as <lb/>

          <p>655. <foreign xml:lang="grc">πῶς... πόθεν</foreign>;] The double inter­ <lb/>
            rogative without any conjunctive, though <lb/>
            almost unknown in English, is so com­ <lb/>
            mon in Greek that if I cite from the <lb/>
            77th epigram of Paulus Silentiarius <lb/>
            the question <foreign xml:lang="grc">τίς</foreign> run <foreign xml:lang="grc">ταῦτα λέγεις</foreign>; it is <lb/>
            only as an excuse for giving . transla. <lb/>
            tion of that singular epigram which <lb/>
            purports to be a dialogue between a <lb/>
            corpse in his grave (speaking perhaps <lb/>
            through the epitaph on his tombstone) <lb/>
            and an indifferent paser-by: <lb/>
            My name's— What matter ? and my home- I care not <lb/>
            My birth was noble- What and if it were not? <lb/>
            Glory I won— What boots it in the tomb? <lb/>
            And here I lie - Who says so, and to whom? <lb/>
            By the words <foreign xml:lang="grc">παρὰ τοῖς ᾶρχουσι</foreign> he means <lb/>
            .. in the dicastic courts," over each of <lb/>
            which,as we know, an archon was ac­ <lb/>
            customed to preside. " If one should <lb/>
            lose an action before the archons, how <lb/>
            and whence will he pay the fine? It <lb/>
            would not be fair to pay it out of the <lb/>
            common fund." <foreign xml:lang="grc">πόθεν</foreign> is taken as the <lb/>
            equivalent to <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐκ τίνος</foreign>, from which <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐκ</foreign> is <lb/>

          <p>657. <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐδὲ δίκαι</foreign>] She is again borrow­ <lb/>
            ing from the Republic, <foreign xml:lang="grc">δικαι</foreign> re <foreign xml:lang="grc">καὶ <lb/>
            ἐγκλήματα πρὸς ἀλλήλονς</foreign>, says the Platonic <lb/>
            Socrates, <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐκ οἰχήσεται ἐξ αὐτῶν, ὡς ἔπος <lb/>

            (464 D). And Plutarch tells us that <lb/>
            this result did actually follow from the <lb/>
            legislation of Lycurgus. See his Ly­ <lb/>
            curgus, chap. 24. It will be observed <lb/>
            that instead of directly answering her <lb/>
            husband's question, Praxagora raises a <lb/>
            preliminary objection, which disposes <lb/>
            of the assumption upon which the <lb/>
            question is founded. This is a common <lb/>
            meaning of <foreign xml:lang="grc">πρῶτον</foreign>, Before we get to that <lb/>
            point. So in Lysistrata 497, the magis­ <lb/>
            trate having said that the money was <lb/>
            required for carrying on the war, Lysi­ <lb/>
            strata takes the preliminary objection, <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀλλ᾽ οὐδὲν δεῖ πρῶτον πολεμεῖν</foreign>. So again <lb/>
            in Plutus 519, 522, in the course of the <lb/>
            dialogue between Poverty and Chremy. <lb/>
            lus, a dialogue which, in many respects, <lb/>
            recalls the present. The statement that <lb/>
            there will be no more lawsuits naturally <lb/>
            alarms the two old men, who are well <lb/>
            aware that the bulk of the population, <lb/>
            if not themselves (563 supra), gain their <lb/>
            living, in one way or another, by means</p><pb n="103"/>
            
          <p>BLEP. Just one other thing. If an action they bring, <lb/>
            What funds will be mine for discharging the fine ? <lb/>
            You won't pay it out of the stores, I opine.</p>
          <p>PRAX. A fine to be paid when an action they bring! <lb/>
            Why bless you, our people won't know such a thing <lb/>
            As an action. BLEP. No actions! I feel a misgiving. <lb/>
            Pray what are “ our people " to do for a living ?</p>
          <p>CHR. You are right: there are many will rue it. PRAX. No doubt. <lb/>
            But what can one then bring an action about ?</p>
          <p>BLEP. There are reasons in plenty; I'll just mention one. <lb/>
            If a debtor won't pay you, pray what's to be done ?</p>
          <p>PBAX. If a debtor won't pay ! Nay, but tell me, my friend, <lb/>
            How the creditor came by the money to lend ? <lb/>
            All money, I thought, to the stores had been brought. <lb/>
            I've got a suspicion, I say it with grief, <lb/>
            Your creditor's surely a bit of a thief.</p>
          <p>BLEP. Now that is an answer acute and befitting.</p>
          <p>of litigation. Her husband at once ex­ <lb/>
            claims <foreign xml:lang="grc">τουτὶ δὲ πόσους ἐπιτρίψει</foreign>, quot cirea <lb/>
            nostros, dii boni, ea res pessumdabit ? to <lb/>
            quote Le Fevre's rendering. And even <lb/>
            Chremes, who generally acquiesces in <lb/>
            Praxagora's scheme, cannot help sharing <lb/>
            the apprehensions of Blepyrus in this <lb/>
            matter: <foreign xml:lang="grc">κἀγὼ ταύτῃ γνώμην ἐθέμη´᾽</foreign>, And <lb/>
            I too teas thinking the same; with which <lb/>
            Dindorf compares Sophocles, Philoctetes <lb/>
            1448 and Hdt. i. 120. Compare St. <lb/>
            Chrysostom, Hom. i. in Hebr. ad finem, <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ταύτῃ τίθεται τὰς ψήφους</foreign>.</p>
          <p>660. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐδάνεισ᾽</foreign>] Praxagora deals with <lb/>
            the particular case of money lent; but <lb/>
            her argument is equally applicable to <lb/>
            every other sort of debt. Where there <lb/>
            is no private property, there can be no <lb/>
            lending of money, no selling of goods, <lb/>
            no letting of houses, nor any other <lb/>
            transaction whereby the relationship of <lb/>
            debtor and creditor is created. Blepyrus <lb/>
            therefore passes from the case of a civil <lb/>
            debt to that of a criminal liability.</p>
          <p>662. XP. <foreign xml:lang="grc">νὴ τὴν Δημητρ᾽</foreign>] This entire <lb/>
            line (with <foreign xml:lang="grc">γε διδάσκεις</foreign> for at <foreign xml:lang="grc">διδάσκει</foreign>) <lb/>
            was formerly given to Blepyrus; but <lb/>
            Bentley saw that the direct address, <lb/>
            "you explain the matter well," could <lb/>
            not belong to the speaker who im­ <lb/>
            mediately adds " now then, let her tell <lb/>
            me," and with his usual acumen trans­ <lb/>
            ferred the first six words to the friend <lb/>
            of Blepyrus. But this involves a slight <lb/>
            further alteration, for Chremes never <lb/>
            addresses Praxagora herself, but always <lb/>
            speaks to his friend. For <foreign xml:lang="grc">γε διδάσκεις</foreign> <lb/>
            we should therefore read at <foreign xml:lang="grc">διδάσκει</foreign>.</p><pb n="104"/>

          <p>The change from the latter words to the <lb/>
            former was inevitable, so soon as they <lb/>
            were supposed to be spoken by Blepyrus. <lb/>
            .. By Demeter," says Chremes, in effect, <lb/>
            “she has given you a good answer." <lb/>
            “ Then let her tell me this," says Ble­ <lb/>
            pyrus, propounding his next difficulty. <lb/>
            And then turning to his wife, he adds, <lb/>
            .. That difficulty, I think, you cannot <lb/>

              it is not confined to one particular <lb/>
              eatable. It is used, as the Scholiast ob­ <lb/>
              serves, and as is frequently the case, for <lb/>
              food in general. There seems little, or <lb/>
              no, similarity between this regulation <lb/>
              of Praxagora, and the Spartan custom <lb/>
              mentioned in Athenaeus, iv. 18, with <lb/>
              which Bergler compares it. The Spartan <lb/>
              offender was required to contribute a <lb/>
              dessert, or some accessories of a dessert, <lb/>
              but he does not seem to have been de­ <lb/>

            From the repeated allusions in this <lb/>
            play to these light-fingered gentry, we <lb/>
            may infer that they were at this time <lb/>
            carrying on their trade pretty briskly. <lb/>
            Their modus operandi is described by <lb/>
            Euelpides in Birds 496. He has been <lb/>
            stopping too late at a name-day feast, <lb/>
            and is leaving the city at night to re­ <lb/>
            turn to Halimus, <lb/>
            But scarce I emerge from the wall <lb/>
            When I get such a whack with a stick on my back from a rascally thief, that I fall, <lb/>
            And he skims off the cloke from my shoulders or e'er for assistance I'm able to bawl. <lb/>
            As <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀποδύω, λωποδύτης</foreign>, and the like, are <lb/>
            specially applied to highway robberies, <lb/>
            Praxagora's first words <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐκ ἤν οἴκοι γε <lb/>
            καθεύδῃς</foreign> are a mere joke; for it is certain <lb/>
            that if a man stays at home, says Le <lb/>
            Fevre, "tutum eum a <foreign xml:lang="grc">λωποδυτῶν</foreign> per­ <lb/>
            petuo fore, seu sub Praxagora, seu sub ar­ <lb/>

            you walk abroad. Dr. Blaydes's transla­ <lb/>

            was the same in ancient Rome, " In <lb/>

            carmina antiqua in quibus laudes erant <lb/>

            accompanied by instrumental music).- <lb/>
            Varro (cited by Nonius, ii. 70). Various <lb/>
            passages relating to these old Roman <lb/>
            recitations are collected by Macaulay <lb/>
            in the Preface to his Lays of Ancient <lb/>
            Rome. And although the practice of <lb/>
            employing boys for this purpose seems <lb/>
            to have soon died out, yet, of course, <lb/>
            the recitations themselves have every­ <lb/>
            where prevailed down to comparatively <lb/>
            modern times. During the mediaeval <lb/>
            period they were continually kept up <lb/>
            in the halls of powerful chieftains and <lb/>
            military knights. By the law of Castile <lb/>
            it was part of the training of a Christian <lb/>
            knight that during his repast his mind <lb/>
            was to be refreshed with the recital, <lb/>
            from history, of deeds of ancient <lb/>
            heroism.” — Prescott's Ferdinand and <lb/>

          <p>681. <foreign xml:lang="grc">κληρωτήρια</foreign> Since the discovery <lb/>
            of Aristotle's Polity of Athens, it seems <lb/>
            impossible to doubt that these were, <lb/>

            of the dicastic sortition, but the stalls <lb/>
            or balloting booths in which the sortition <lb/>
            took place. The remarks of that treatise <lb/>
            upon the dicastic arrangements at <lb/>
            Athens are ably explained by Mr. Poste <lb/>
            in the Classical Review (vols. vii and x). <lb/>
            The word is supposed to occur three <lb/>

            Poste's <foreign xml:lang="grc">κλη</foreign>[<foreign xml:lang="grc">ρωτριδες</foreign>] seems far more <lb/>

            twice, and its meaning is unmistak­ <lb/>

            thing else but what Dr. Sandys calls <lb/>
            a " balloting chamber," which was <lb/>
            probably, as Mr. Poste suggests, a mere <lb/>
            movable erection, like our polling <lb/>
            booths. And this accords with the <lb/>
            testimony of all the old grammarians, <lb/>
            Pollux alone offering the alternative of <lb/>
            a “balloting urn." The Scholiast's note <lb/>
            here, <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὰς κληρωτὰς ἀρχἀς</foreign>, may possibly <lb/>
            . refer to the section of the Polity which <lb/>
            contains the account of the <foreign xml:lang="grc">κληρωτήρια</foreign>. <lb/>
            These balloting booths Praxagora will <lb/>
            bring into the Agora, and set them up <lb/>
            (<foreign xml:lang="grc">στήασα</foreign>) beside the statue of Harmo­ <lb/>
            dius. But her subsequent arrangements <lb/>
            have nothing to do with any dicastic <lb/>
            proceedings. To say, as Mr. Paste says, <lb/>
            that in the Utopia of Praxagora the <lb/>
            men were to dine in their dicastic <lb/>
            sections (or as he calls them, their juror <lb/>
            brigades) involves a complete misunder­ <lb/>
            standing of Praxagora's Utopia. There <lb/>
            are now no dicastic sections; all dicasts <lb/>
            and dicastic matters have been swept <lb/>
            for ever away. All citizens are to come <lb/>
            to the banquet, and the lots are merely <lb/>
            to assort the individual Athenians into <lb/>
            their respective banqueting halls.</p>

            set up the balloting booths by the statue <lb/>

            statues, but a group representing the <lb/>

            banqueting hall) he is to dine, <foreign xml:lang="grc">δέον <lb/>
            εἰπεἱν δικάζειν εἰπε δειπνῖν</foreign>, says the <lb/>
            Scholiast, merely, however, meaning <lb/>
            that <foreign xml:lang="grc">δικάζειν</foreign> would have been the word <lb/>
            required under the pre-Praxagorean <lb/>
            arrangements. For while these banquet­ <lb/>
            ing halls were still law courts, it was <lb/>
            the practice, in the early morn, to affix <lb/>
            on each hall, in which a court was to <lb/>
            be held that day, one of the second ten <lb/>
            letters (from A onwards) of the Greek <lb/>
            alphabet. The second ten letters were <lb/>
            employed because the first ten (from A <lb/>
            to K) were, appropriated for a different <lb/>
            purpose in the process of assorting the <lb/>
            dicastic sections. These dicastic sections, <lb/>
            having been fully formed, ascertained <lb/>
            the halls in which they were to sit by <lb/>
            drawing tickets in the <foreign xml:lang="grc">κληρωτήριον</foreign> : the <lb/>
            section, for instance, which drew a ticket <lb/>
            marked with the letter A, went off to <lb/>
            determine law suits in the hall over the <lb/>
            portals of which the letter <foreign xml:lang="grc">Λ</foreign> was affixed. <lb/>
            But under Praxagora's system all this <lb/>
            is changed. There are no dicastic <lb/>
            sections to be assorted, and the first ten <lb/>
            letters are therefore available for the <lb/>
            banqueting halls themselves. Every <lb/>
            citizen draws his individual letter at <lb/>
            Praxagora's balloting booths, and will <lb/>
            be duly admitted to the banquet pre­ <lb/>
            pared in the hall distinguished by the <lb/>
            same letter. Hence in the Plutus the <lb/>
            word <foreign xml:lang="grc">γράμμα</foreign> is used to signify as well <lb/>
            the letter on the ticket (277,278) as the <lb/>

            a <foreign xml:lang="grc">δικαστήριον</foreign> or a <foreign xml:lang="grc">στοὰ</foreign>, nor is there any <lb/>
            ground for supposing that the <foreign xml:lang="grc">θη̑τα</foreign> were <lb/>
            to go to a hall whose name commenced <lb/>
            with 6, any more than the <foreign xml:lang="grc">κάππα</foreign> were <lb/>
            to a hall commencing with <foreign xml:lang="grc">κ</foreign>. That <lb/>
            joke was confined to the <foreign xml:lang="grc">βη̑τα</foreign>. Words- <lb/>
            worth (Athens and Attica, chap. xxii) <lb/>
            says “the <foreign xml:lang="grc">θη̑τα</foreign> cannot refer to the <lb/>
            Theseum, which is not a stoa: but it <lb/>
            refers to the stoa of Zeus Eleutherios, <lb/>
            which stood parallel to the stoa Basi­ <lb/>

              for my own part, I think that if Aristo­ <lb/>

              a joke on <foreign xml:lang="grc">θη̑τα</foreign>, he would have made it: <lb/>
              and that his not doing so shows that <lb/>
              we are not to look for any jest, or pun, <lb/>

            Utopia does not trouble itself about <lb/>
            such trifles as these; and Praxagora <lb/>
            assures him that every citizen will get <lb/>

            a comma after <foreign xml:lang="grc">παρ</foreign>’ <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐμοὶ δ</foreign>’, and construe <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">έτέρα τις</foreign> together, as in Lysistrata 524. <lb/>

            can, as it seems to me, be less easily <lb/>

            Praxagora off the stage, and Chremes, <lb/>
            two lines later, returns to his house to <lb/>
            arrange and bring out his chattels. Of <lb/>
            Blepyrus we hear nothing more until <lb/>
            the closing scene of the play, when he, <lb/>
            his little daughters, and the Chorus all <lb/>
            go off to join the festivities, which <lb/>
            under the new system are gratuitously <lb/>
            provided for the public. Meanwhile <lb/>
            two more or less farcical scenes are <lb/>
            intercalated to illustrate the practical <lb/>
            working of the new arrangements as to <lb/>
            the community of goods and the coin­ <lb/>
            munity of women. First comes the <lb/>
            "scene of the two citizens," who are <lb/>
            the two neighbours of Blepyrus, Chremes <lb/>
            and the husband of the second woman ; <lb/>
            the former, in obedience to the law, <lb/>
            preparing to take his goods to the <lb/>
            public stores, whilst the other rails at <lb/>
            him for his folly in doing so. After <lb/>
            this comes the " scene of the three <lb/>
            Hags," all eager to avail themselves of <lb/>
            the privileges which Praxagora had <lb/>
            promised them, supra 617, 618.</p>

          <p>and the stage is now left vacant. <lb/>
            Whilst he is busy indoors with his <lb/>
            chattels, the Chorus sing an ode which <lb/>
            is now lost (its sole trace being the <lb/>
            survival of the word XOPOY in the <lb/>
            Ravenna MS.), but which, judging from <lb/>
            the usual practice of Aristophanes, we <lb/>
            may safely conclude to have been anti­ <lb/>
            strophical to the ode supra 571-581, <lb/>
            and to have celebrated the brilliant <lb/>
            success of Praxagora's exposition of her <lb/>
            scheme, wherein she had more than <lb/>
            fulfilled the anticipations expressed in <lb/>
            , the strophe. As soon as the song is <lb/>
            concluded, Chremes reappears with his <lb/>
            goods, and proceeds to marshal them <lb/>
            on the stage after the fashion, as Bergler <lb/>
            observes, of a great religious procession <lb/>
            at a Panathenaic or other festival. One <lb/>
            is to be the <foreign xml:lang="grc">κανηφόρος</foreign>, the Queen of the <lb/>
            May, the young and noble maiden who <lb/>
            bore the holy basket (Achamians 242, <lb/>
            253; Lysiatrata 646). Next to her walks <lb/>
            the <foreign xml:lang="grc">διφροφόρος</foreign> carrying her chair (Birds <lb/>
            1552). Afterwards come the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ίδριαφόροι</foreign> <lb/>
            and <foreign xml:lang="grc">σκαφηφόροι</foreign>,the resident aliens and <lb/>
            their wives and daughters, carrying pots <lb/>
            of water, and dishes filled with cakes <lb/>
            and honeycombs, <foreign xml:lang="grc">κηίων καὶ ποπάνων <lb/>

            feeble old men who walked in the pro­ <lb/>
            cession carrying their branches of olive; <lb/>
            see Wasps 544 and the note there. And <lb/>
            doubtless if we knew more fully the <lb/>
            details of a Panathenaic procession, we <lb/>
            should find something to explain all the <lb/>
            other directions which Chremes gives in <lb/>
            the passage before us. The Scholiasts <lb/>
            quite misunderstand the scene, and <lb/>
            imagine that the procession is one, not <lb/>
            of household goods, but of female slaves, <lb/>
            and accordingly take <foreign xml:lang="grc">κιναχύρα</foreign> to be <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὄνομα δούλης</foreign>, and explain <foreign xml:lang="grc">στρέψασα</foreign> by <lb/>

            so on.</p>
          <p>730. <foreign xml:lang="grc">κιναχύρα</foreign>] The first article brought <lb/>
            out, and placed in the van of the pro­ <lb/>
            cession, is the <foreign xml:lang="grc">κιναχύρα</foreign>, a word which <lb/>
            does not, I believe, occur elsewhere, but <lb/>
            which, from its obvious derivation (<foreign xml:lang="grc">παρὰ</foreign> <lb/>
            TO <foreign xml:lang="grc">κινει̑ν τὰ ἄχυρα</foreign>, Bergler), can signify <lb/>
            nothing else than the "bran-sifter," <lb/>
            a sort of sieve-like instrument for sepa­ <lb/>
            rating the fine flour from the bran. We <lb/>
            may infer from the present passage <lb/>
            (1) that it was not an agricultural or <lb/>
            mill implement, but a kitchen utensil <lb/>
            in a private house; (2) that in figure it <lb/>

            not raising a laugh by selecting the <lb/>

            refers to the floury state in which it <lb/>
            would naturally be found. See Lysi­ <lb/>
            strata 149. In the lines cited by the <lb/>
            Scholiast on Birds 1551 from the "Gods " <lb/>
            of Hermippus, we should probably read <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ώσπερ αἱ Κανηφόροι Λευκοι̑σιν ἀλφίτοισιν <lb/>

            the basket-bearer walked the <foreign xml:lang="grc">διφροφόρος</foreign> <lb/>
            (Birds 1552), who carried the chair on <lb/>
            which, I presume, the bastet-bearer <lb/>
            took her seat, when the procession <lb/>
            arrived at Athene's Temple. The ex­ <lb/>
            pression <foreign xml:lang="grc">παρ</foreign>’ <foreign xml:lang="grc">αἰτὴν</foreign> in line 737 has refer­ <lb/>
            ence merely to the juxtaposition in <lb/>
            which the two articles are placed by <lb/>
            Chremes. In the procession she followed <lb/>
            immediately behind the leader. See <lb/>
            Birds 1551, 1552, and the Scholiast <lb/>
            there. Here the chair-girl is repre­ <lb/>
            sented by the pot, black and sooty by <lb/>
            constant use : and if the part could be <lb/>
            taken by a slave (which, however, is <lb/>
            hardly probable), it might be conjec­ <lb/>
            tured that there is an allusion here to <lb/>
            Ethiopian slaves, who (some years later <lb/>
            at least) were considered very fashion­ <lb/>

            in which he expresses it. He is still <lb/>
            harping on the distinction between <lb/>
            giving and taking, on which he has been <lb/>
            dwelling with such relish, supra 778- <lb/>
            783. And so, when Chremes talks of <lb/>

            this <foreign xml:lang="grc">τεσσαρακοστὴ</foreign> was, as the Scholiast <lb/>
            says, a direct property tax of 2½ per <lb/>
            cent., just as the <foreign xml:lang="grc">πεντεκοσιοστὴ</foreign> mentioned <lb/>
            infra 1007 was a direct property tax of <lb/>
            one-fifth of a unit per cent. on the <lb/>
            taxable capital is, in my judgement, <lb/>
            absolutely certain. No other percentage <lb/>
            could have been expected to raise the <lb/>
            enormous sum of 500 talents; whilst <lb/>
            a property tax of one-fortieth would not <lb/>
            exceed an income tax for one year of <lb/>
            68. in the £. Mr. Grote's objections <lb/>
            (History of Greece, chap. lxxv) rest on <lb/>
            no substantial foundation. He says <lb/>
            that on one occasion (De Symmoriis, <lb/>
            sec. 33) Demosthenes alludes to a pro­ <lb/>
            position for raising 500 talents by direct <lb/>
            property tax as something extravagant, <lb/>
            which the Athenians would not endure <lb/>
            to hear mentioned." But this is not so. <lb/>
            Demosthenes says that the Athenians <lb/>
            would not stand a direct property tax <lb/>
            of one-twelfth (which would be required <lb/>
            to raise 500 talents). He does not <lb/>
            suggest that they would not stand a <lb/>
            direct property tax of one-fortieth, <lb/>
            which was the proposal of Euripides: <lb/>
            on the contrary, he speaks of a tax of <lb/>
            one-fiftieth as if it would create no <lb/>
            difficulty whatever. It seems to me <lb/>
            that Euripides (whether a son of the <lb/>
            great poet or some other Athenian of <lb/>
            the same name) was one of the officers <lb/>
            (<foreign xml:lang="grc">πορισταὶ</foreign>)whose duty it was both to <lb/>
            devise and levy taxes (see the note on <lb/>
            Frogs 1505): that there had arisen <lb/>
            some urgent necessity for 500 talents, <lb/>
            possibly on account of the expenses</p><pb n="129"/>
            
          <p>My cheek with coppers; then I steered away <lb/>
            And went to purchase barley in the market; <lb/>
            When just as I was holding out my sack, <lb/>
            The herald cried, No copper coins allowed ! <lb/>
            Nothing but silver must be paid or taken !</p>
          <p>CIT. Then that late tax, the two-and-a-half per cent., <lb/>
            Euripides devised, weren't we all vowing <lb/>
            'Twould yield five hundred talents to the state ? <lb/>
            Then every man would gild Euripides. <lb/>
            But when we reckoned up, and found the thing <lb/>
            A Zeus's Corinth, and no good at all, <lb/>
            Then every man would tar Euripides.</p>
          <p>incurred by reason of the Anti-Spartan <lb/>
            League: that Euripides proposed to meet <lb/>
            this need by a property tax of 2½ per <lb/>
            cent.; that the people were overjoyed <lb/>
            to think that they could get out of their <lb/>
            difficulties by so small a sacrifice; that <lb/>
            the tax was accordingly voted, and <lb/>
            Euripides proceeded to assess it; but <lb/>
            that, no sufficient allowance having <lb/>
            been made for the vast decrease of tax­ <lb/>
            able capital which had followed the <lb/>
            disastrous termination of the Pelopon­ <lb/>
            nesian War, it was found that a tax of <lb/>
            2½ per cent, would be quite inadequate <lb/>
            (<foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐκ ἤρκεσεν</foreign>) to realize anything like <lb/>
            the amount required; and that there­ <lb/>
            upon the popular feeling ran high <lb/>
            against the financier who proposed it. <lb/>
            Very possibly at that time, as in the <lb/>
            time of Demosthenes, it would have <lb/>
            required a tax of one-twelfth, and not <lb/>
            merely of one-fortieth, to raise 500 <lb/>
            talents. This <foreign xml:lang="grc">ψήΦισμα</foreign>therefore became <lb/>

            sufficient to say that the words <foreign xml:lang="grc">ό Διὸς <lb/>

            your threats of a summons ? The thread <lb/>

            " What if the women will not let you ?" <lb/>
            " At them, head foremost." " What if <lb/>

            Bergk, apparently not perceiving the <lb/>

            the case contemplated in Praxagora's <lb/>
            speech, supra 693-701, but the pro­ <lb/>

            there shadowed out For one thing, <lb/>
            both the girl and her young lover are <lb/>
            in full revolt against the regulations of <lb/>
            Praxagora. For another, no Gaffer Hob­ <lb/>
            nail, no snub-nosed Lysicrates, comes to <lb/>
            claim precedence over the youth. It is <lb/>
            difficult to feel absolute certainty as to <lb/>
            the stage arrangements, but in my <lb/>
            judgement the Hag is peeping out <lb/>
            through the half-closed door (Peace <lb/>
            980, 1), whilst the girl is looking from <lb/>
            the window overhead. The contention <lb/>
            between the two could hardly have been <lb/>
            carried on, had the girl been standing <lb/>
            in one of the balconies (menianorum) <lb/>
            which, according to Vitruvius (v. 6, ed <lb/>
            Schneider), formed part of the stock <lb/>
            scenery of the comic stage: and indeed <lb/>
            such balconies are never mentioned in <lb/>
            the Comedies of Aristophanes, and were <lb/>

          <p>897. <foreign xml:lang="grc">έθελοι</foreign>] Scilicet <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὴ νία</foreign>. The first <lb/>
            four lines of the song are a comparison <lb/>

            parison between two persons, the girl <lb/>
            and herself. The Hag has now had her <lb/>
            say, and the girl's turn has come. The <lb/>
            idea of prefixing musical terms to the <lb/>
            following songs is, and some of the <lb/>
            musical terms themselves are, bor­ <lb/>

            And constant and loving as I ? <lb/>
            No: she would be flitting away from her friend, <lb/>

          <p>904. <foreign xml:lang="grc">παραλελεξαι</foreign>] The Hag's song was <lb/>
            addressed to her expected lovers; but <lb/>
            the girl, rejoicing in her youth, makes <lb/>
            a direct attack upon the Hag. You <lb/>
            have picked out the shaggy hairs (a sign <lb/>
            of age) from your eyebrows, she says. <figure type="illustration">

          <p>906. TO <foreign xml:lang="grc">τρη̑μα</foreign>] At this direct attack, <lb/>
            the Hag loses her temper, and utters <lb/>
            imprecations which it is not easy or <lb/>
            desirable to interpret with exactness. <lb/>
            Le Fevre supposes <foreign xml:lang="grc">τρη̑μα</foreign> to be “eam <lb/>

            cf. Lysistrata 410. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὄφις</foreign> is used, both in <lb/>
            Greek and in Latin erotics, to denote <lb/>
            a cold and languid lover. Two trochaic <lb/>
            feet have dropped out of this antistrophe,</p><pb n="140"/>
            <figure type="illustration">

          <p>and I have inserted, in brackets, Bergk's <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ψυχρὸν</foreign>, and Blaydes's <foreign xml:lang="grc">σαύτη</foreign>, not as <lb/>
            thinking that they are the genuine <lb/>
            words of Aristophanes, but to show the <lb/>
            reader the metrical completeness of the <lb/>
            song.</p>
          <p>911. <foreign xml:lang="grc">αἶ αἶ</foreign>] Instead of bandying threats <lb/>
            with the Hag, the girl pursues the <lb/>
            doubtless more aggravating course of <lb/>
            lifting up her voice in a young maiden's <lb/>
            love-ditty. The words <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀλλ</foreign>’ J <foreign xml:lang="grc">μαῖα</foreign>, the <lb/>
            Scholiast says, are addressed <foreign xml:lang="grc">πρὸς τὴν <lb/>
            γραυ̑ν</foreign>, but although on the stage the <lb/>
            girl may, by way of mockery, so address <lb/>
            them, yet in the song itself <foreign xml:lang="grc">μαῖα</foreign> signifies <lb/>
            an overindulgent old nurse, such as she <lb/>
            who brought Romeo and Juliet together. <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">Ὀρθαγόρας</foreign> is the name which this Juliet <lb/>
            bestows on her Romeo. The transla­ <lb/>
            tion might perhaps lead the reader to <lb/>
            suppose that the love-sick maiden in <lb/>
            the ditty is really bewailing her mother's <lb/>
            absence, whereas she merely regards it <lb/>
            as affording a good opportunity for <lb/>
            a stolen meeting with her lover. If <lb/>
            this song is intended to correspond <lb/>
            with the double song which follows, as <lb/>
            can hardly be questioned, its opening <lb/>
            lines must have been greatly amplified, <lb/>
            possibly by the introduction of a further <lb/>
            portion of the original love-ditty, from <lb/>
            which Aristophanes is borrowing.</p>

            were notorious for their dissolute and <lb/>

            Like a young cat. They'll all come first to me.</p>
          <p>GIRL. What, to your funeral ? A new joke, hey ?</p>
          <p>charge, but the old lady is certainly <lb/>
            going too far when the imputes to her <lb/>
            rival the terrible vice of the Lesbians. <lb/>
            It would seem that this vice (<foreign xml:lang="grc">λεσβιάζειν</foreign>) <lb/>
            was at Athens described by its initial <lb/>
            letter X (<foreign xml:lang="grc">λάβδα</foreign> or <foreign xml:lang="grc">λάμβδα</foreign>), <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀπὸ του̑ <lb/>
            ἄρχοντος στοιχείου</foreign>, as the Scholiast says. <lb/>
            The same vice is imputed to the flute­ <lb/>
            girl in Wasps 1846.</p>
          <p>921. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὑφαρπάσαιο</foreign>] See supra 722. The <lb/>
            girl closes the contest with a little out­ <lb/>
            burst of triumphant insolence. “Never <lb/>
            shall you intercept (wile away) my <lb/>
            lovers (<foreign xml:lang="grc">τοὺς ἐμοὺς ἐραστὰς</foreign>, Scholiast),” <lb/>
            she sings, " Never shall you destroy or <lb/>
            carry off the charm of my youth." With <lb/>
            Bergk and Velsen, I have given these <lb/>
            last three lines to the girl, for by <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὴν <lb/>
            ἐμὴν ὤραν</foreign> we must necessarily under­ <lb/>
            stand "my youth.” It cannot mean, <lb/>
            as Bothe, thinking it spoken by the <lb/>
            Hag, explains it, " horam, h. e. tempus <lb/>
            mihi constitutum atque assignatum <lb/>
            lege nova."</p>
          <p>926. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπ</foreign>’ <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐκφοράν</foreign>] I have arranged the <lb/>
            speakers in these lines, and indeed fre­ <lb/>
            quently elsewhere in this scene, some­ <lb/>
            what differently from preceding editors. <lb/>
            The Hag is reduced to iambics, but still <lb/>
            asserts her legal rights. " Sing what <lb/>
            you will," she says, " and peep out like <lb/>
            a cat: no man will go first to you: all <lb/>
            will come first to me." " First to you?" <lb/>
            retorts the girl, " 0 yes, to your funeral, <lb/>
            I suppose. Is that a novel jest, Mother <lb/>
            Mouldy?” The same question <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπ</foreign>’ <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐκ­ <lb/>
            φοράν</foreign>; occurs in a very similar passage <lb/>
            in Plutus 1008, and is there too ad­ <lb/>
            dressed to an ancient coquette. Both <lb/>
            there and here some translate it "to <lb/>
            carry away your goods"; but in both <lb/>
            places it clearly means to carry you out</p><pb n="142"/>

              <foreign xml:lang="grc">φθείρεται</foreign>. Very possibly the passage in <lb/>
              our Plutus was repeated from the first <lb/>
              comedy of that name. so that the joke <lb/>
              was a stale one at the date of the <lb/>
              Ecclesiazusae. The girl excuses herself <lb/>
              for using an old joke by explaining that <lb/>
              it was all the more suitable to an old <lb/>
              woman.</p>
          <p>928. <foreign xml:lang="grc">τοὐμὸν γη̑ρας</foreign>] Perhaps this little <lb/>
            speech should conclude with a note of <lb/>
            interrogation. As the words stand, they <lb/>
            must be translated It is not my age that <lb/>
            will vex you; meaning, I suppose, that <lb/>
            . it is not by her age, but by her superior <lb/>
            wisdom and experience, that she will <lb/>
            wile away the girl's lovers. " Not your <lb/>
            age ?" says the girl, " what then ? <lb/>
            your beauty I suppose: your rouge and <lb/>

            red colour of the roots. It imparts <lb/>
            a fine deep red to oils, wax, and all <lb/>
            unctuous substances; its chief use is <lb/>
            for colouring plasters, lipsalves, &amp;c.” <lb/>
            Hellenic ladies used it as rouge; and <lb/>
            in the British Museum (Third Vase <lb/>
            Room, Case 43) some of this rouge may <lb/>
            still be seen in a pyxis or rouge-pot <lb/>
            discovered in the Greek cemetery at <lb/>
            Naucmtis, and ascribed by the Museum <lb/>
            authorities to the best period of Greek <lb/>
            art. Both the alkanet and the ceruse <lb/>
            (supra 878) were constant accessories <lb/>
            to a Greek toilet, and are frequently <lb/>
            mentioned in that character. Thus in <lb/>
            Xenophon's Oeconomicus, chap. x, <lb/>

            disreputable old man, and therefore, <lb/>
            the girl thinks, a fitting partner for <lb/>
            the old Hag; <foreign xml:lang="grc">φαλακρὸς οἶτος καὶ πένης</foreign>, <lb/>

            dinner table (supra 692). It is im­ <lb/>
            possible that he can be carrying the <lb/>
            torch through all the ensuing scene; <lb/>
            and I imagine that he deposits it in <lb/>
            some place, where Blepyrus finds it, <lb/>
            infra 1150. The words <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὁόξει γε καὶ σοὶ</foreign> <lb/>
            in the preceding line mean Ies, and <lb/>

            movements, and reappears the moment <lb/>
            the other is gone. The Hag at first does <lb/>
            not withdraw at all, but stays by the <lb/>
            door till she has overheard whom the <lb/>
            youth is seeking: she then does retire, <lb/>

          <p>988-945. Tyrwhitt was the first to <lb/>
            arrange these two stanzas properly, and <lb/>
            to show that they are in the most <lb/>
            familiar and most famous of all scolium- <lb/>
            metres, viz. that of "Harmodius and <lb/>
            Aristogeiton." The metrical system <lb/>
            will be found in the note to Wasps <lb/>
            1225. The first two lines are identical <lb/>
            with the hendecasyllables of Catullus <lb/>
            and Martial "Doctis, Jupiter, et labo­ <lb/>
            riosis." Tyrwhitt also suggested that <lb/>
            the commencement of the first stanza <lb/>
            is borrowed from one of the scolia pre­ <lb/>
            served by Athenaeus, xv. 50, <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BELL_67_fig171.jpg"/></figure> <lb/>
              And this seems probable enough. See <lb/>
              also Fritzsche, Quaest. Aristoph. p. 48. <lb/>
              But the last line seems also a borrowed <lb/>
              line, and possibly the entire stanza is <lb/>
              a parody of some lost scolium. In the <lb/>
              passage before us each stanza appears <lb/>
              to be a soliloquy: the youth being un­ <lb/>
              aware of the proximity of the Bag; <lb/>
              and the Hag's recitation being an <lb/>
              " saide," inaudible to the youth.</p>

            ii. 711). And possibly the two cha­ <lb/>
            racters are not absolutely inconsistent. <lb/>
            The phrase <foreign xml:lang="grc">οἰα τἀπὶ Χαριξέιης</foreign> passed <lb/>
            into a proverb applied to performances <lb/>
            without restraint or reason. It is used <lb/>
            not only by Aristophanes, but also by <lb/>
            Cratinus and Theopompus (Etymol. <lb/>
            Magn). The passages are collected <lb/>
            in Kuster's note. <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὶμώζων</foreign> in the pre­ <lb/>

            and she from the window above, and <lb/>
            her lover from the street below, indulge <lb/>
            in a little amatory duet.</p>
          <p>952. <foreign xml:lang="grc">δεῦρο δή</foreign>] That these two songs <lb/>
            are antistrophical, as Bentley pointed <lb/>
            out, it is impossible to doubt: the first <lb/>
            line, and the last three, are identical <lb/>
            in both, and there are many traces of <lb/>
            correspondence in the intermediate <lb/>
            portions. But in one or other of them, <lb/>
            if not in both, the metrical system has <lb/>
            fallen so completely out of gear, that <lb/>
            it would require far more conjectural <lb/>
            pressure than, in the absence of any <lb/>
            help from the MSS., it is permissible <lb/>
            to exert, to bring them back into <lb/>
            harmony with each other. Brunck and <lb/>
            some others, contrary to all authority <lb/>
            and, as it seems to me, contrary to all <lb/>
            sense and likelihood, take the first song <lb/>
            from the girl and transfer it to the Bag. <lb/>
            The neuter <foreign xml:lang="grc">φίλον</foreign> is used here for the <lb/>
            masculine, and in the antistrophe for <lb/>

            from love itself but from the misery <lb/>
            of disappointed love. Le Fevre trans­ <lb/>
            lates it, sine, Brunck concede, Bothe <lb/>
            cessa, desine me vexare. The way in <lb/>
            which she wishes to be set free is <lb/>
            described in the two following lines. <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ταῦτα εὶποῦσα εἰσέροχεται</foreign>, says the Scho­ <lb/>
            liast; and this must of course be the <lb/>
            fact, if the youth's song is, as Kuster <lb/>
            insists, a <foreign xml:lang="grc">παρακλαυσιθυρν</foreign>, since that is <lb/>
            the wail of an excluded lover, and is <lb/>
            incompatible with the sight of his <lb/>
            mistress. But there seems no reason <lb/>
            why the girl should re-enter the house, <lb/>
            until the Hag comes out of it, infra <lb/>
            976; and in my judgement this is not <lb/>
            a <foreign xml:lang="grc">παρακλαυσίθυρον</foreign> at all, but the youth <lb/>
            from below is singing to the girl at <lb/>

            Ah me, what means this strange unrest, <lb/>
            This love which lacerates my breast ? <lb/>

            Be pitiful, be merciful, <lb/>
            And send my love to me.</p>
          <p>Enough, I trow, is said to show the straits I'm in, my lonely grieving.</p>

          <p>HAG. Then why that lighted torch ? What seek you here ?</p>
          <p>YOUTH. Some Anaphlystian burgher. HAG. What’s his name ?</p>
          <p>YOUTH. No, not Sebinus; whom you want belike.</p>
          <p>HAG. By Aphrodite, will you, nill you, sir.</p>
          <p>YOUTH. Ah, but we're not now taking cases over <lb/>
            Sixty years old : they've been adjourned till later;</p>
          <p>Anaphlystian really had the misfortune <lb/>
            to bear the ill-sounding name of Sebinus; <lb/>
            the double appellation (’<foreign xml:lang="grc">Αναφλύστιος</foreign> as <lb/>

            <foreign xml:lang="grc">βινεῖν</foreign>) prompting the unsavoury jest <lb/>
            which is found here, and in Frogs 427. <lb/>
            In the next line, the Hag, whether <lb/>
            stimulated by the jest, or getting tired <lb/>
            of all this dallying, grapples with the <lb/>
            youth, and endeavours to drag him into <lb/>

            Imitating their language, the youth <lb/>
            says, " We are not taking to day <foreign xml:lang="grc">γυναῖκας</foreign> <lb/>
            over sixty years old," like the Hag: <lb/>
            "we are taking those under twenty," <lb/>
            like the girl. " Loquitur quasi de litibus <lb/>

            thing is known of this law or custom of <lb/>
            the Paetians, who were a Thracian tribe, <lb/>
            along whose territory Xerxes passed in <lb/>
            his march from the Hellespont to Then­ <lb/>
            saly.—Hdt.vii. 110. But it was obviously <lb/>
            familiar to the Athenians at the date of <lb/>
            this play, and must have laid down some <lb/>
            rule, which it was optional for a person <lb/>
            to adopt, or repudiate, of his own free <lb/>
            choice, without incurring any penalty. <lb/>

            ἐστι Θρα̣κιόν. ἔπαιξε δὲ παρὰ τὸ παίειν</foreign>. <lb/>
            And it was the reading of every edition <lb/>
            before Brunck, who substituted <foreign xml:lang="grc">πεττο</foreign>ȋ<foreign xml:lang="grc">ς</foreign> <lb/>
            from the only MS. of which he was cogni­ <lb/>
            zant for this part of the play, a MS. of <lb/>
            little value, and as full of futile emen­ <lb/>
            dations as if it were a recension by <lb/>
            a modern critic. But it is infinitely <lb/>
            more probable that <foreign xml:lang="grc">Παιτο</foreign>ȋ<foreign xml:lang="grc">ς</foreign> should have <lb/>
            been corrupted into the familiar <foreign xml:lang="grc">πεττο</foreign>ȋ<foreign xml:lang="grc">ς</foreign> <lb/>
            than that the converse corruption should <lb/>
            have taken place. Nobody has attempted <lb/>
            to explain the reference to <foreign xml:lang="grc">πεσσοὶ</foreign>, a <lb/>
            game apparently bearing a slight re­ <lb/>
            semblance to our “draughts,” though <lb/>
            played with fewer pieces and doubtless <lb/>

          <p>991. <foreign xml:lang="grc">κρησέραν</foreign>] The word is not, I <lb/>
            believe, used elsewhere by any writer of <lb/>
            the classical period, and its meaning is <lb/>
            not altogether clear. But it seems to <lb/>
            me that the basket called a <foreign xml:lang="grc">κόφινος</foreign> was <lb/>
            made of wicker cased in coarse linen, <lb/>
            and that <foreign xml:lang="grc">κρησέρα</foreign> was the name given to <lb/>
            this casing. Both the Scholiast and <lb/>
            Suidas define <foreign xml:lang="grc">κρησέρα</foreign> as <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸ περιβολαιον <lb/>
            τω̑ν κοφίνων</foreign>, and I think that the author <lb/>
            of the Etymologicum Magnum would <lb/>
            have done the same, had he not been <lb/>
            led astray by his own fanciful derivation <lb/>
            of the word from <foreign xml:lang="grc">κάρα</foreign> (on the analogy, <lb/>
            I presume, of <foreign xml:lang="grc">κρήδεμνον</foreign>), and so con­ <lb/>
            sidered it the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπι-βολαιον</foreign>, not the <foreign xml:lang="grc">περι­ <lb/>
            βολαιον</foreign>, of a <foreign xml:lang="grc">κόφινος</foreign>. The word was after­ <lb/>
            wards used to denote various articles, <lb/>
            probably made of this pack-cloth, such <lb/>
            as a strainer, a linen bag, the fan of <lb/>
            a winnowing machine. Galen (in his <lb/>
            “linguarum Hippocratis explicatio ”) de­ <lb/>
            scribes it as <foreign xml:lang="grc">ή του̑ ἀλεύρου πτίσις ὀνομαζο­ <lb/>
            μένη, μάραιππος δέ τίς ἐστιν αὐτὴ λινου̑ς</foreign>. <lb/>
            The application of the word in the <lb/>
            present line is not more clear than its <lb/>
            signification. Le Fevre takes the speaker <lb/>
            to mean that the Hag might indeed <lb/>
            supply him with a <foreign xml:lang="grc">κρησέ</foreign>pa, but that is <lb/>
            not what he is wanting to-day. Bergler, <lb/>
            with more probability, suggests that she <lb/>
            is herself addressed as a <foreign xml:lang="grc">κρησέρα</foreign>, and <lb/>
            that this was a cant term at Athens for <lb/>
            a common prostitute. Anyhow there is <lb/>
            a play on the words <foreign xml:lang="grc">κρουστέον, κρούση̣ς</foreign>. <lb/>
            and <foreign xml:lang="grc">κρησέρα</foreign>.</p>
          <p>992. <foreign xml:lang="grc">θαυμάζεις</foreign>] The Hag speaks as if <lb/>
            she were a shy and modest young maiden, <lb/>
            whom it is surprising to find out of <lb/>
            doors alone. The youth tells her, in <lb/>
            effect, that she is maturo propior funeri. <lb/>
            and that her fittest lover is the " under­ <lb/>
            taker," who paints the oil bottles carried <lb/>
            out and buried with the dead. See the <lb/>
            note on 537 supra. And be warns her <lb/>
            not to be seen at the door, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπὶ θύραισιν</foreign>, <lb/>
            lest the undertaker should think she is <lb/>

            But we, he says, have been taught by <lb/>

            One fifth per cent. on all your wealth — of years.</p>
          <p>HAG. 0 yes, you must; 0 yes, by Aphrodite, <lb/>

            emendation for the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐτω̑ν</foreign> of the MSS. <lb/>
            and older editions. Boeckh (Public <lb/>
            Economy of Athens, iv. 8) supposes that <lb/>

            of one-fifth of a unit per cent. on the <lb/>
            taxable capital of Athens. And as <lb/>
            debtors to the state were <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἄτιμοι</foreign>, de­ <lb/>
            prived of the rights and privileges of <lb/>

            had paid to the state one five-hundredth <lb/>
            of her possessions. But for <foreign xml:lang="grc">τω̑ν ὄντων</foreign> <lb/>
            (bonorum), as Tyrwhitt observes, the <lb/>
            youth maliciously substitutes <foreign xml:lang="grc">τω̑ν ἐτω̑ν</foreign> <lb/>
            (annorum), perhaps insinuating that <lb/>
            her " years " were her only possessions <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">Τω̑ν ἐμω̑ν</foreign> made no sense at all: for. <lb/>

            Greece. The substance, if not the very <lb/>
            language of the psephism, is given us <lb/>
            by Xenophon (Hellenics, i. 7. 21). The <lb/>
            psephism of Cannonus, he represents <lb/>
            Euryptolemus as saying, enacts that <lb/>

            resembled the youth's case, was that the <lb/>
            prisoner was to plead in fetters. In like <lb/>

            —Scholiast. Cf. Knights 262. And <lb/>
            this is a very common meaning of the <lb/>
            word. Le Fevre translates hinc illinc <lb/>
            prehensum; Brunck diremtum ; but I am <lb/>
            convinced that the former is the true <lb/>
            . interpretation here. The prisoner was <lb/>
            brought forward in chains, and was <lb/>
            probably supported by, if not actually <lb/>
            bound to, a jailer on each side. But <lb/>
            Brunck started a novel theory about <lb/>
            the psephism of Cannonus, which, it <lb/>
            must be admitted, has found some very <lb/>
            distinguished supporters, including Mr. <lb/>
            Grote in the sixty-fourth chapter of his <lb/>
            History. In the speech, to which refer­ <lb/>
            ence is made in the preceding note, Eury­ <lb/>
            ptolemus is earnestly pleading that a <lb/>
            separate trial should be accorded to each <lb/>
            of the accused general; but well knowing <lb/>
            that he must not altogether run counter <lb/>
            to the popular feeling, he proposes that <lb/>
            these separate trials should be conducted <lb/>
            under the severest conditions, either <lb/>
            under the provisions of the psephism of <lb/>
            Cannonus (which he describes in the <lb/>
            terms already given), or under the law <lb/>
            against sacrilege and high treason (crimes <lb/>
            of which they were not even accused). <lb/>
            And the resolution which he ultimately <lb/>
            proposed took the following shape, That <lb/>
            each general should have a separate trial, <lb/>
            conducted under the provisions of the <lb/>
            psephism of Cannonus, <foreign xml:lang="grc">κατὰ τό Καννώνου</foreign> <figure type="illustration">

            him a separate trial And he explains <lb/>
            the followingpassage as follows:- Juxta <lb/>
            Cannoni decreturn ait adolescens sibi <lb/>
            impositam esse necessitatem <foreign xml:lang="grc">δίχαέκάσυην</foreign>, <lb/>
            non <foreign xml:lang="grc">κίνειν</foreign> judicare, Bed <foreign xml:lang="grc">βινεῖν</foreign> permolere. <lb/>
            Jocas in eo consistit. quod quum in de­ <lb/>
            creto esset reos <foreign xml:lang="grc">διειλημμένους ἀπολογεῖσθαι</foreign>, <lb/>
            seorsum causam dicere, adolescens dicat <lb/>
            se <foreign xml:lang="grc">διαλελημένον</foreign> tanquam in direrea di­ <lb/>
            ductum binis vetulis simul morigera­ <lb/>
            turum.” Mr. Grote, avoiding the con­ <lb/>
            fusion of thought involved in this <lb/>
            explanation, observes, .. The young man <lb/>
            does not compare his situation with that <lb/>
            ofthe culprit, but with that of the dikastery <lb/>
            which tried culprita. The psephism of <lb/>
            Kannonus directed that each defendant <lb/>
            should be tried separately; accordingly <lb/>
            if it happened that two defendants were <lb/>
            presented for trial, and were both to be <lb/>
            tried without a moment's delay, the <lb/>
            dikastery could only effect this object <lb/>
            by dividing itself into two halves or <lb/>
            portions. By doing this (<foreign xml:lang="grc">κρίνειν ὀιαλε­ <lb/>
            λημμένον</foreign>) it could try both the defendunts <lb/>
            at once; but in no other way. Now the <lb/>
            young man in Aristophanes compares <lb/>
            himself to the dikastery thus circum­ <lb/>
            stanced; which comparison is signified <lb/>
            by the pun of <foreign xml:lang="grc">βινεῖν διαλελημμέτον</foreign> in <lb/>
            place of <foreign xml:lang="grc">κρίνειν διαλελημμένον</foreign>." This <lb/>
            amendment of Brunck's explanation, <lb/>
            though clear and coherent in itself, <lb/>
            shocks all one's notions, not only of <lb/>
            Aristophanic humour, but also of dicastic <lb/>
            usages. A dicastery had no power to <lb/>
            subdivide itself in the way suggested; <lb/>
            there were dicasteries enough to give a <lb/>
            separate and simultaneous trial not only <lb/>
            to two, but to ten defendants; whilst, as <lb/>
            regards the proposal of Euryptolemus. <lb/>
            it is clear that he intended the trials <lb/>
            to be not simultaneous, but successive. <lb/>
            so that the popular fury might have time <lb/>
            to calm down ; he even suggests which <lb/>
            prisoner shall stand his trial first. There <lb/>
            is no ground for supposing a pun <lb/>
            between <foreign xml:lang="grc">κρίνειν</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">βνεῖν</foreign>. There is no <lb/>
            such phrase known as <foreign xml:lang="grc">κρίνειν διολελημ­ <lb/>
            μένον</foreign>. And the youth's <foreign xml:lang="grc">βινεῑν διαλελημ­ <lb/>
            μένον</foreign> is intended to answer to the words <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀποὀικεῑν δεδεμέιον</foreign> which are found in <lb/>
            the psephism of Cannonus.</p>

            from the unnatural brilliance of their <lb/>
            eyes. The Phryne, of whose beauty so <lb/>
            many anecdotes are told, belonged of <lb/>
            course to a later period. The words <lb/>
            which follow, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἅχουσαν λήκυθον, πρὸς ταῖς <lb/>
            γνάθοις</foreign>, are plainly a continuation of <lb/>
            the grim joke which pervades the scene, <lb/>
            that the Hag resembles a corpse with <lb/>
            her funeral bottle beside her. It is <lb/>

            the phrase, expressing the speaker's <lb/>

            as the Thasian wine which had got <lb/>
            inside her head. The Thasian wine <lb/>
            was famous for its bouquet, and when <lb/>
            it was bottled in these earthen flagons, <lb/>
            the vintners were accustomed to put <lb/>
            in it wheaten dough (<foreign xml:lang="grc">σταῖς</foreign>) steeped in <lb/>

            it are collected from the poets in <lb/>
            Athenaeus, i. chapters 51-53. In the <lb/>
            latter chapter he cites some hexameters <lb/>
            of Hermippus, describing the various <lb/>
            kinds of wine: and of the Thasian <lb/>
            he says: <lb/>
            A sweet apple-fragrance so mellow, <lb/>
            Has the flagons of Thaws invaded, <lb/>
            That the Thasian has hardly its fellow, <lb/>
            'Tis the best of all wines, I'm persuaded, <lb/>

            are a parody of a favourite couplet of <lb/>
            Homer, who says that Nireus was the <lb/>
            fairest (II. ii. 674) and Aias the shape­ <lb/>

            Thasian and the Chian are frequently <lb/>
            bracketed together as the noblest wines <lb/>

            tained an absolute supremacy, yet in <lb/>
            softer and more luxurious times, the <lb/>
            sweet-tasted and sweet-scented Thasian <lb/>
            was at least an equal favourite. "Ye <lb/>
            drink your Thasian wine," says St. <lb/>
            Chrysostom to the wealthy members of <lb/>
            his congregation (Hom. 48 in Matth. <lb/>
            501 B), "Ye drink your Thasian wine, <lb/>
            and will not give even a cup of cold <lb/>
            water to the Lord who gave you all," <lb/>
            that is, to the poor of Christ. And in <lb/>
            the fifty-third Homily 544 A, he uses <lb/>
            the expression <foreign xml:lang="grc">οί</foreign> TOP <foreign xml:lang="grc">Θάσιον οίνον πίνον­ <lb/>

            who drinks the water from the crystal <lb/>
            spring. St. Clement of Alexandria in <lb/>
            his Paedagogus, ii. 30, running through <lb/>
            the principal Hellenic wines, and ap­ <lb/>

            Plutus 4.</p>
          <p>1127. <foreign xml:lang="grc">αὐτοὒ μένουσ</foreign>'] The line would <lb/>
            seem to be a quotation from some <lb/>
            tragic poet. It is hardly spoken when <lb/>
            the door of the central house is opened. <lb/>
            .and Blepyrus comes out with some <lb/>
            little girls, the children of himself and <lb/>
            Praxagora.</p>
          <p>1182. <foreign xml:lang="grc">πλεῖον ἢ τρισμυρίων</foreign>] See the <lb/>
            note on Wasps 707. The 20,000 men­ <lb/>
            tioned there are the poorer citizens who <lb/>
            are to be recipients of the state's bounty. <lb/>
            Here he is reckoning up the entire <lb/>
            number of Athenian citizens (for there <lb/>
            is no distinction now between rich and <lb/>
            poor), and agrees in his computation <lb/>
            with Hdt. v. 97 and Plato, Symposium, <lb/>

          <p>1133. <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐ δεδείπνηκας μόνος</foreign>] These words <lb/>
            are probably intended to be taken <foreign xml:lang="grc">παρ' <lb/>
            ὑπόνοιαν</foreign>, as the Scholiast says, and as <lb/>
            in the following line the Chorus appear <lb/>
            to take them. Yet they are no doubt <lb/>
            susceptible of another interpretation, <lb/>
            viz. that Blepyrus is happy in still <lb/>
            having his dinner to enjoy, whilst the <lb/>
            other citizens have nearly finished <lb/>
            theirs.</p>

          <p>'Twill make us merry all the whole night through. <lb/>
            But tell me, ladies, where my master is; <lb/>
            I mean, the husband of my honoured mistress.</p>
          <p>CHOP. If you stay here, methinks you'll find him soon.</p>
          <p>MAID. Aye, here he comes. He's off to join the dinner. <lb/>
            O master, 0 you lucky, lucky man !</p>
          <p>BLEP. What I ? MAID. Yes you, by Zeus, you luckiest man. <lb/>
            What greater bliss than yours, who, out of more <lb/>
            Than thrice ten thousand citizens, alone, <lb/>
            Have managed, you alone, to get no dinner ?</p>
          <p>CHOR. You tell of a happy man, and no mistake.</p>
          <p>MAID. Hi! Hi! where now? BLEP. I'm off to join the dinner.</p>
          <p>MAID. And much the last of all, by Aphrodite. <lb/>
            Well, well, my mistress bade me take you, sir, <lb/>
            You and these little girls and bring you thither. <lb/>
            Aye, and there's store of Chian wine remaining, <lb/>
            And other dainties too; so don't delay.</p>
          <p>says the Scholiast, and with him the <lb/>
            Commentators agree. But this is to <lb/>
            destroy all the pleasantry of the passage. <lb/>
            The <foreign xml:lang="grc">μείραες</foreign> are the little daughters of <lb/>
            Blepyrus and Praxagora, who have just <lb/>
            come on the stage with their father. <lb/>
            See the notes on 1112 and 1127 supra. <lb/>
            The women who form the Chorus were <lb/>
            contemporaries of Praxagora, and, as <lb/>
            we know from the entrance scene, were <lb/>
            actually married women, who could in <lb/>
            no sense be called <foreign xml:lang="grc">μείρακες</foreign>. And see <lb/>
            infra 1151, 2.</p>
          <p>1139. <foreign xml:lang="grc">Χῖος</foreign>] We have seen in the note <lb/>
            on 1119 supra that the Chian was <lb/>
            deemed the " peerless Achilles" of wines. <lb/>
            And in fact it was the choicest and most <lb/>
            expensive of the old Hellenic wines, the <lb/>
            drink of the wealthiest citizens, just as <lb/>
            the Coan was the worst and cheapest, <lb/>
            the drink of the agricultural labourer <lb/>
            (Demosthenes, v. Lacritum 39). The <lb/>
            Chian stood at the head, and the Coan <lb/>
            at the foot, of the list of Hellenic wines. <lb/>
            And hence it probably was, that dicers, <lb/>
            playing in their wine-parties, gave the <lb/>
            name of <foreign xml:lang="grc">Χῖος</foreign> to the highest, and <foreign xml:lang="grc">Κῳ̄ος</foreign> <lb/>
            to the lowest, throw of the dice. " The <lb/>
            ancient medals of Chios," says Dr. Clarke <lb/>
            (Travels, iii. 192)," all have reference to <lb/>
            the Chian wine, which still maintains <lb/>
            its pristine celebrity." And almost all <lb/>
            the ancient Chian coins in the British <lb/>
            Museum bear, amongst other emblems, <lb/>
            the figure of a wine-jar set underneath <lb/>
            a cluster of grapes.</p><pb n="172"/>

          <p>1144. <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὔκουν</foreign>] Blepyrus, amazed at <lb/>
            the magnificent invitation which his <lb/>
            waiting-maid issues, ironically proposes <lb/>
            to make it still more magnificent. <lb/>
            .. There is no end, no measure, limit, <lb/>
            bound," to his invitation. Had you not <lb/>
            better, he says, bid all the spectators <lb/>
            come, and not only such of them as are <lb/>
            well-disposed ? and all the judges, and <lb/>
            not merely those who look kindly on our <lb/>
            play ? At the same time he intimates <lb/>
            that they will get nothing if they do <lb/>
            come: if they really want a dinner, they <lb/>
            had better depart each to his own home. <lb/>
            The imaginary character of the proffered <lb/>
            feast is several times intimated in these <lb/>
            closing lines. Observe that in his in­ <lb/>
            vitation to all the spectators he enumer­ <lb/>
            ates merely boys and men of different <lb/>
            ages; he makes no allusion to women. <lb/>
            The question whether women formed <lb/>
            part of the audience is discussed in the <lb/>
            Introduction to this play.</p>
          <p>1150. <foreign xml:lang="grc">δᾷδα ταυτηνι</foreign>] This is perhaps the <lb/>
            torch which the youth was carrying <lb/>
            on his first appearance. See the note <lb/>
            on 934 supra.</p>
          <p>1153. <foreign xml:lang="grc">μέλος μελλοδειπνικόν</foreign>] A play on <lb/>
            the words is, of course, intended. Aelian <lb/>
            (V. H. viii. 7) calls the "Song before <lb/>
            meals" a <foreign xml:lang="grc">μέλος συγκλητικόν</foreign>. At the <lb/>
            wedding-banquet of Alexanderthe Great, <lb/>
            he says, one <foreign xml:lang="grc">μέλος</foreign> was sung to summon <lb/>
            the guests to the banquet, and another <lb/>
            to dismiss them when it was over. <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸ</foreign> <figure type="illustration">

            to the theatrical judges, in the character, <lb/>
            not of Praxagora's friends, but of the</p><pb n="173"/>
            
          <p>And all the audience who are well disposed, <lb/>
            And every judge who looks not otherwards, <lb/>
            Come on with us; we'll freely give you all.</p>
          <p>BLEP. Nay, no exceptions; open wide your mouth, <lb/>
            Invite them all in free and generous style, <lb/>
            Boy, stripling, grandsire; yea announce that all <lb/>
            Shall find a table all prepared and spread <lb/>
            For their enjoyment, in — their own sweet homes. <lb/>
            But I ! I'll hurry off to join the feast, <lb/>
            And here at least I've got a torch all handy.</p>
          <p>CHOR. Then why so long keep lingering here, nor take <lb/>
            These little ladies down ? And as you go, <lb/>
            I'll sing a song, a Lay of Lay-the-dinner. <lb/>
            But first, a slight suggestion to the judges.</p>
          <p>Aristophanic choreutae, or, in other <lb/>
            words, their remarks aie <foreign xml:lang="grc">παραβατικά</foreign>. <lb/>
            That the <foreign xml:lang="grc">κριταὶ</foreign>, in comedy at all events, <lb/>
            were five in number is plain upon all <lb/>
            the authorities. Most of them are cited <lb/>
            and discussed in Hermann's little treatise, <lb/>
            De Quinque judicibus Poetarum (Opuscula, <lb/>
            vii. 88). Thus Hesychius says, <foreign xml:lang="grc">πέντε <lb/>
            κριταί· τοσοῦτοι τοῖς Κωμικοῖς ἔκρινον, οὐ <lb/>
            μόνον Ἀθήνησιν, ἀλλὰ καὶ ἐν Σικελίᾳ</foreign>. And <lb/>
            Photius, <foreign xml:lang="grc">πέντε κριταί· οί</foreign> Tol, <foreign xml:lang="grc">Κωμῳδοῖς <lb/>
            ἀποδεικνί μενοι</foreign>. And the Scholiast on <lb/>
            Birds 445, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἔκρινον έ κριταὶ τοὺς Κωικούς· <lb/>
            οί δὲ λαμβάνοντες τὰς έ ψήφους εὐδαιμόνουν</foreign> <lb/>
            (<foreign xml:lang="grc">έ κριταὶ</foreign> is Hermann's emendation for <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">οἱ κριταὶ</foreign>, and its correctness is shown <lb/>
            by the subsequent <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὰς έψήφους</foreign>). The <lb/>
            spectators might applaud or hiss, and <lb/>
            the judges would no doubt be swayed, <lb/>
            and to some extent rightly so, by the <lb/>
            reception which a comedy experienced <lb/>
            from the assembled people; but still <lb/>
            the ultimate decision rested entirely <lb/>
            with the <foreign xml:lang="grc">κριταὶ</foreign> themselves, whether they <lb/>
            were the five judges of Athenian <lb/>
            comedy, or the more or less numerous <lb/>
            judges who might be the umpires in <lb/>
            other contests. <foreign xml:lang="grc">Καὶ γὰρ οὖν καὶ ἐν τοῖς</foreign> <figure type="illustration">

              which Hermann thinks was originally <lb/>
              an anapaestic of Epicharmus, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐν πέντε <lb/>

              Yet verily all these things on the knees of the high gods lie. <lb/>

              address to the judges could have formed <lb/>
              no part of the original play. It could <lb/>
              not have been inserted until the play <lb/>
              had been not only accepted, but also <lb/>
              allotted the first place in the order of <lb/>
              performance.</p>
          <p>1155. <foreign xml:lang="grc">τοίς σοφοῖς</foreign>] We know that <lb/>
            Aristophanes always claimed the <foreign xml:lang="grc">σοφοὐς</foreign> <lb/>
            and <foreign xml:lang="grc">δεξιοὺς</foreign> amongst the audience as his <lb/>
            unwavering supporters; see the note on <lb/>
            Wasps 1047. But here the word <foreign xml:lang="grc">σοφοὶ</foreign> <lb/>
            has probably a somewhat more specific <lb/>
            meaning. The play is a compound of <lb/>
            philosophic theory and broad farce. <lb/>
            And by <foreign xml:lang="grc">σοφοὶ</foreign> he probably means the <lb/>
            philosophic theorists from whom be has <lb/>
            borrowed the idea of his eommunistic <lb/>
            legislation. However, according to <lb/>
            Plutarch's (if it be Plutarch's) uncritical <lb/>
            " Comparison of Aristophanes and Men­ <lb/>
            ander," such an appeal as this would <lb/>
            meet with no response from any quarter; <lb/>
            for, says that writer, Aristophanes was <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὔτε τοῖς πολλοῖς ἀρεστὀς, οὔτε τοῖς φρον­ <lb/>

          <p>1160. <foreign xml:lang="grc">μἠ 'πιορκεῖν</foreign>] Pherecrates, an <lb/>
            older contemporary of our poet, in a <lb/>
            passage preserved by both Photius and <lb/>
            Suidas, a. v. <foreign xml:lang="grc">Φίλιος</foreign>, addresses the judges <lb/>
            in a very similar strain. He has ap­ <lb/>
            parently been bringing an accusation <lb/>
            of unfairness against the judges in some <lb/>
            earlier contest: <figure type="illustration">

            Let it nothing tell against me, that my play must first begin ; <lb/>
            See that, through the afterpieces, back to me your memory strays ; <lb/>
            Keep your oaths, and well and truly judge between the rival plays. <lb/>
            Be not like the wanton women, never mindful of the past, <lb/>
            Always for the new admirer, always fondest of the last. <lb/>

          <p><figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BELL_67_fig211.jpg"/></figure> Now to you, the judges, I say, <lb/>
              You who judge betwixt us to-day, <lb/>
              Keep your oaths, be honest and true, <lb/>

              Else, by Zeus, the lover of friends, <lb/>
              (These the words Pherecrates sends), <lb/>
              He'll, with chiding sterner than this, <lb/>
              Pay you out for judging amiss. <lb/>
              Each line consists of a trochaic dipody, <lb/>
              followed by a choriamb. The judges <lb/>
              were chosen, and the oath administered, <lb/>
              in the full theatre, after the spectators <lb/>
              bad taken their seats, and immediately <lb/>
              before the commencement of the dram­ <lb/>
              atic performances. Plutarch tells us <lb/>
              that when Sophocles first came forward <lb/>
              as a competitor in the tragic contests, <lb/>
              the excitement was so great, and the <lb/>
              partisan spirit was running so high, <lb/>
              that the Archon did not choose the <lb/>
              judges by lot, <foreign xml:lang="grc">κριτὰς μὲν οὐκ ἐκλήρωσε <lb/>

              offer sacrifice and made them take <lb/>
              the oath, and sit as judges; and that, <lb/>
              although they were ten in number, one <lb/>
              from each tribe, <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐκ ἐφη̑κεν αὐτοὺς ἀπελ­ <lb/>

          <p>1181. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὡς ἐπὶ νίκη</foreign>] Aristophanes loves, <lb/>
            as the play draws to a close, to indulge <lb/>
            in notes of triumph and anticipations <lb/>

          <p>THE Ecclesiazusae is found, in whole or in part, in the following <lb/>
            MSS.:— <lb/>
            R. The Ravenna MS. <lb/>
            H. The Monaco (Herculis Portus) MS. (No. 137). <lb/>
            F. The first Florentine (No. 31, 15 in the Laurentian Library). <lb/>
            P. The first Parisian (No. 2712). <lb/>
            P1. The second Parisian (No. 2715).</p>
          <p>Only R. and H. give the play in its entirety. But F. and P1. <lb/>
            omit only about fifty verses at the end, both terminating with line <lb/>
            1136. P., in Brunck's time (A.D. 1783), contained the first 444 lines, <lb/>
            but part of the MS. has perished since then, and in Velsen's time <lb/>
            (A.D. 1883) it went no further than line 282.</p>
          <p>All these are collated by Velsen, whose diligence and accuracy as <lb/>
            a collator are beyond all praise. For the readings of P. between 282 <lb/>
            and 444 we must rely upon Brunck, who did not profess to give <lb/>
            a complete account of its variations.</p>
          <p>Of these five MSS., R. H. and P. are far superior to the other two. <lb/>
            F. is full of obvious blunders, destructive alike of the sense and the <lb/>
            metre. The transcriber of Pl. or of the MS. from which it was copied, <lb/>
            seems to have had before him F. or a MS. of the same type, and to <lb/>
            have attempted, by emendations of his own, to restore both sense and <lb/>
             <pb n="181"/>
            metre. Sometimes be hits upon the true reading, but far more fre­ <lb/>
            quently he strays further from it than F. itself does.</p>
          <p>The editions of Aristophanes in my possession are enumerated at the <lb/>
            commencement of the Appendix to the Frogs. With the exception of <lb/>
            Xeobari (No. 6) all the first nineteen, from Aldus to Dindorf, contain <lb/>
            the Ecclesiazusae. After Dindorf's I have the following editions of <lb/>
            the play:- <lb/>
            (19) Bothe. Leipsic, 1845. <lb/>
            (20) Bergk. Leipsic, 1857. <lb/>
            (21) Meineke. Leipsic, 1860. <lb/>
            (22) Holden. London, 1868. <lb/>
            (23) Blaydes. Halle, 1881. <lb/>
            (24) Yelsen's Ecclesiazusae. Leipsic, 1883.</p>
          <p>It should be remembered that my account of the readings of the <lb/>
            printed editions of Aristophanes is confined to those in my own posses­ <lb/>
            sion. Thus, if I say “All editions before Gelenius read so and so," <lb/>
            I mean that all the editions in my possession do so. If I say that such <lb/>
            a word is read by Fracini, Grynaeus, Brunck, recentiores (I use “recen­ <lb/>
            tiores" as if it were undeclinable), I mean that Fracini and Gelenius <lb/>
            are the only editions in my possession before Brunck which so read, but <lb/>
            that all the editions in my possession after Brunck do so. I believe, <lb/>
            however, that my list contains all the editions of any value.</p>
          <p>I have taken one or two hints from an article in the Quarterly <lb/>
            Review of October, 1884. From Dr. Blaydes's critical notes on Frogs 76 <lb/>
            and elsewhere I gather the Reviewer to have been his friend Arthur <lb/>
            Palmer, the late eminent Professor of Latin in the University of Dublin, <lb/>
            to whom indeed Dr. Blaydes dedicates his own edition of Aristophanes.</p>
          <p>There being so much fewer MSS. and editions of this play than of the <lb/>
            Frogs, I have been able to give a more complete synopsis of the manu­ <lb/>
            script readings, and to trace them more minutely through the printed <lb/>
            editions; though-even in the MSS. it did not seem desirable to enumerate <lb/>
            such matters as an erroneous accent or the omission of an iota sub­ <lb/>
             <pb n="182"/>
            scriptum, unless indeed the error or omission might conceivably point <lb/>
            to some other reading; whilst in the printed editions there are often <lb/>
            obvious misprints, to record which would be merely to compile a list <lb/>
            of If Errata." In the present play too, the names of the speakers are, in <lb/>
            the MSS., so often omitted, and the dialogue, both in the MSS. and <lb/>
            in the editions, is so variously distributed, that I have not, as a rule, <lb/>
            thought it necessary to notice these minor points.</p>

            The last word in the line is in all the <lb/>
            MSS. and all the editions before Brunck <lb/>
            (and Bekker afterwards) written <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐξητη­ <lb/>
            μένον</foreign>. Scaliger suggested <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐξησκημένον</foreign>. <lb/>
            Dobree suggests that the Scholiast read <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐζητημένον</foreign>, which is adopted, as the true <lb/>
            reading of the text, by Holden and <lb/>
            Velsen, but can hardly mean excogitatum. <lb/>

            last three words of the line Blaydes <lb/>
            substitutes <foreign xml:lang="grc">τοῖς σοφοῖσιν ἐξηυρημένον</foreign> from <lb/>
            the Scholiast's gloss <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἡ ε̃ννοια, καλλιστα</foreign> <lb/>
            Tins <foreign xml:lang="grc">σοφοῖς εὑρημένον, κ.τ.λ</foreign>. But if the <lb/>
            Scholiast had read <foreign xml:lang="grc">τοῖς σοφοῖσιν ἐξηυρη­ <lb/>
            μένον</foreign>, he. could not possibly have said <lb/>
            that the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ε̃ννοια</foreign> (the meaning) of the words <lb/>
            was <foreign xml:lang="grc">τοῖς σοφοῖς εὑρημένον</foreign>, so explaining <lb/>
            idem per idem. And indeed it seems <lb/>
            pretty clear that the Scholiast is really <lb/>
            explaining <foreign xml:lang="grc">εὐσκόποισιν</foreign>. Moreover line 6 <lb/>
            seems to show that the lamp was <lb/>
            placed in some conspicuous position, as <lb/>
            the signal to which the women were <lb/>
            to gather. And while the expression <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">γονἀς</foreign> in the succeeding line is satisfied <lb/>
            by the <foreign xml:lang="grc">τροχηλάτου</foreign> of line 1, there is <lb/>
            nothing to which the expression rvxar <lb/>
            can answer unless we read <foreign xml:lang="grc">έν εὐσκόποισιν <lb/>
            ἐξηρτημένον</foreign> here. There is not much <lb/>
            force in Meineke's objection, “Suspensae <lb/>
            lucemae nullum in sequentibus indi­ <lb/>
            cium" (Vind. Aristoph.). The lamp <lb/>
            was certainly somewhere, and wherever <lb/>
            it was, there is no mention of it " in <lb/>

            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐστὶν ἤδ</foreign>’ <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐκκλησία</foreign>, generally followed by <lb/>

            otherwise all the MSS. and Brunck and <lb/>

            before Dindorf, except Junta and Gor­ <lb/>
            mont who have <foreign xml:lang="grc">έτέρας</foreign>, obviously a mere <lb/>
            copyist's error, since it ruins the metre, <lb/>
            neither Junta nor Gormont, nor any <lb/>
            other editor before Dindorf, introducing <lb/>
            into the line the particle <foreign xml:lang="grc">πως</foreign>. The <lb/>
            MSS. however have <foreign xml:lang="grc">πως</foreign> though they <lb/>
            do not know where to locate it, R. and <lb/>
            H. placing it before, and F. P. and P1. <lb/>
            after, the participle. It is, as Meineke <lb/>
            admits, " perquam incommoda," and is <lb/>
            probably interpolated from some gloss, <lb/>
            perhaps from the very scholium cited <lb/>
            in the first note in the commentary. <lb/>
            Nevertheless Dindorf introduces it into <lb/>
            the text, though in order to make the <lb/>
            line scan, he is obliged to resort to the <lb/>
            old error of Junta and Gormont, and <lb/>
            to substitute <foreign xml:lang="grc">έτέρας πως</foreign> (which is read <lb/>
            by no MS. or edition) for the <foreign xml:lang="grc">έταίρας</foreign> of <lb/>
            the MSS. and (save as aforesaid) all the <lb/>
            editions. And he is followed by all <lb/>
            subsequent editors, who generally con­ <lb/>
            nect <foreign xml:lang="grc">έτέρας</foreign> with <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἔδρας</foreign> the other seats <lb/>
            (Meineke ubi supra), which I confess <lb/>
            seems to me perilously like nonsense. <lb/>
            Velsen reads <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὰς δ</foreign>’ <foreign xml:lang="grc">έτέρας</foreign>, as if the <lb/>
            speaker and her friends were to take <lb/>
            the seats assigned them by Phyromachus, <lb/>
            and the other women to sit where they <lb/>
            could, out of sight. All these diffi­ <lb/>
            culties are avoided if we retain the <lb/>
            genuine reading <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἑταίρας</foreign>. About the <lb/>
            participle which follows there is, as it. <lb/>
            seems to me, much more room for doubt. <lb/>
            H. and all the editions before Brunck <lb/>
             <pb n="184"/>
            have <foreign xml:lang="grc">κἀγαθιζομένας</foreign>. And this is to some <lb/>
            extent approved by Bentley who refers <lb/>
            to the explanations given by Hesychius <lb/>
            and the Etymol. Magn. of <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀγαθιζομένη</foreign>. <lb/>
            viz. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀγαθὰλέγουσα</foreign>and <foreign xml:lang="grc">συνχῶςἀγαθὰ <lb/>
            λέγουσα</foreign> And if the passage is cited <lb/>
            from Agathon, the employment of <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀγα­ <lb/>
            θιζεσθαι</foreign>for <foreign xml:lang="grc">εὐφηυεῖνι</foreign>s just one of the <lb/>
            little conceits which we should expect <lb/>
            in his language. Bentley however him­ <lb/>
            self suggested <foreign xml:lang="grc">κἀγκαθιζομένας</foreign>, and this, <lb/>
            or the cognate form <foreign xml:lang="grc">κἀγκαθεζομένας</foreign>,is <lb/>
            adopted by Dindorf, Bothe, Bergk, <lb/>
            Meineke, Holden, and Blaydes. Scaliger <lb/>
            had previously proposed <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐγκαθιζομένας</foreign>, <lb/>
            which is followed by Brunck, Invernizzi, <lb/>
            Bekker, and Velsen. I confess to a <lb/>
            strong leaning towards <foreign xml:lang="grc">κἀγαθιζομένας</foreign>, <lb/>
            but the word is not found elsewhere, <lb/>
            Bentley's alteration is very slight, and <lb/>
            seems strongly supported by the scho­ <lb/>
            lium above referred to, and by the <lb/>
            Scholiast on this verse, and I have <lb/>
            therefore adopted it. Another suggest <lb/>
            tion by Bentley was <foreign xml:lang="grc">δεῖν</foreign>for <foreign xml:lang="grc">δεῖ</foreign>,but <lb/>
            this was on the old reading in which <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">καταλαβεῖν</foreign>was governed by <foreign xml:lang="grc">έσται</foreign>.See <lb/>
            on 20 supra. The other MS. readings <lb/>
            are <foreign xml:lang="grc">κωλαθιζομένας</foreign>R., <foreign xml:lang="grc">καθαγιαζομένας</foreign> <lb/>
            F. P. P1.</p>
          <p>24-26. <foreign xml:lang="grc">τίδῆτ...λαθεῖν</foreign>.These three <lb/>
            lines are omitted by F. P. P1., the tran­ <lb/>
            scriber's eye having passed from the <lb/>
            final <foreign xml:lang="grc">λαθιῖνο</foreign>f line 23 to the final <foreign xml:lang="grc">λαθεῖν</foreign> <lb/>
            of line 26. Brunck indeed changes, <lb/>
            from his own conjecture, the second <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">λαθεῖνι</foreign>nto <foreign xml:lang="grc">λαβεῖν</foreign>and is followed by <lb/>
            Invernizzi, Dindorf, and Bothe. But <lb/>
            there is no ground for this alteration.</p>

          <p>So. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ΓυνὴΑ</foreign>. It is not easy to say how <lb/>
            many women take part in the ensuing <lb/>
            conversation, or in what manner they <lb/>
            should be described. The MSS. give <lb/>
            us but little assistance. R. F. P1. gene­ <lb/>
            rally omit, the speaker's name alto­ <lb/>
            gether, whilst H. and P. have simply <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">γυνήΤΙ</foreign>S, or something equally indefinite. <lb/>
            The editions before Brunck merely <lb/>
            indicated the speakers with the exception <lb/>
            of Praxagora by <foreign xml:lang="grc">γυ</foreign>., and when two <lb/>
            women speak consecutively, introduced <lb/>
            the second as <foreign xml:lang="grc">έτ</foreign>. or <foreign xml:lang="grc">ᾰλλ</foreign>’.Brunck dis­ <lb/>
            tinguishes nine women, other than <lb/>
            Praxagora, calling them <foreign xml:lang="grc">γυ</foreign>.a: yv. : <lb/>
            and so on down to <foreign xml:lang="grc">γυ. ί</foreign>.This was <lb/>
            followed by Invernizzi, Bekker, Dindorf, <lb/>
            and Bothe. Bergk rightly reduced the <lb/>
            speakers to four: calling them Praxa­ <lb/>
            gora, two women, and the Chorus. And <lb/>
            so, in substance, Meineke, Holden, and <lb/>
            Velsen. Blaydes, omitting the Chorus, <lb/>
            reduced them to three: making the <lb/>
            second woman give one account of her­ <lb/>
            self in 37-40, and a totally different <lb/>
            account in 54-56. This seems an im­ <lb/>
            possible arrangement. The latter lines <lb/>
            are obviously spoken by a woman who <lb/>
            has just hurried breathlessly in. Bergk <lb/>
            gives to the Chorus the present speech <lb/>
            30, 31, and 42-45 infra. The reasons <lb/>
            for my own arrangement will be found <lb/>
            in the commentary.</p>

            that the termination -<foreign xml:lang="grc">εινι</foreign>s in some <lb/>

            reading, this being the <foreign xml:lang="grc">πάροδοςο</foreign>f the <lb/>

            not reading, <foreign xml:lang="grc">κάθιζε Παίων</foreign> or <foreign xml:lang="grc">Πρίων</foreign>. <lb/>

            offers seven conjectures for the choice <lb/>

            the commencement of this line, by a <lb/>
            very singular mistake, all editions before <lb/>

            γονον</foreign>, the MS. reading, was replaced by <lb/>
            Brunck and has since been universally <lb/>
            received.- Perhaps it is wrong to speak <lb/>
            of Elmsley's rule, because he does not pro­ <lb/>
            fess to lay down any absolute rule. He <lb/>
            merely says, " Longe rarius quam puta­ <lb/>
            ram anapaestum in hoc metri genere <lb/>
            inchoat ultima vocis syllaba." And he <lb/>
            adds that of the places in which such <lb/>
            an arrangement occurs, many admit of <lb/>
            an easy emendation, giving as his first <lb/>
            example, <foreign xml:lang="grc">καὶ τοῖσι φενακισμοῖσιν ἐξαπατω­ <lb/>
            μένην</foreign>, where he would change <foreign xml:lang="grc">τοῖσι</foreign> into <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">τοῖτ</foreign>. And this doubtless is the reason <lb/>
            why, in 154 supra, Dindorf prefers <foreign xml:lang="grc">τοῖς</foreign> <lb/>
            the reading of the inferior, to <foreign xml:lang="grc">τοῖστ</foreign> the <lb/>
            reading of the better, MSS. But if it <lb/>
            is admitted, as it is, that Aristophanes <lb/>
            sometimes so wrote, it is merely a <lb/>
            question of the MSS. and of the ear, <lb/>
            whether he did so in any particular <lb/>

            of delicias facit, Velsen <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐρείδεται</foreign>. <lb/>
            Meineke's conjecture, though intro­ <lb/>
            duced into the text by himself, and <lb/>
            adopted by Holden, Blaydes, and Yelsen, <lb/>
            is far the most unsuitable of all: for <lb/>
            Praxagora is plainly on the side of <lb/>
            Thrasybulus, and she is, in this section <lb/>
             <pb n="192"/>
            of her speech, criticizing the action of <lb/>
            the People in regard to their foreign <lb/>
            relations, not satirizing the airs and <lb/>
            graces of any individual orator. In <lb/>
            the next line Blaydes changes <foreign xml:lang="grc">αὐτὸς</foreign> <lb/>

            the transposition is required by the <lb/>

            <foreign xml:lang="grc">έν τοῖς στεφανώμασιν</foreign>, and accordingly <lb/>
            he here omitted <foreign xml:lang="grc">μὴ ιντὸ τριώ ζολον</foreign>. <lb/>
            Bentley suggested an alteration in the <lb/>
            MS. reading by substituting <foreign xml:lang="grc">κὰρεύγων <lb/>

            the necessary transposition of the lines <lb/>

             <pb n="197"/>
            too short; and many years ago noting <lb/>
            the particularity of the <foreign xml:lang="grc">δύο</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">τρεῑς</foreign> <lb/>
            in the latter part of the sentence, I <lb/>
            came to the conclusion that for <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐ</foreign> we <lb/>
            should read <foreign xml:lang="grc">ε̃να</foreign>; and it was an agree­ <lb/>
            able surprise to find that the same idea <lb/>
            bad occurred to Bentley. But I fear <lb/>
            that the short syllable <foreign xml:lang="grc">ε̄ν</foreign> cannot end <lb/>
            a line like this in the middle of a <lb/>
            sentence, and I have come round to <lb/>
            Reiske's suggestion <foreign xml:lang="grc">αὐον</foreign> dry, stale, as <lb/>

            are the answer of Blepyrus to the ques­ <lb/>
            tion asked in the first line ; whilst the <lb/>
            final <foreign xml:lang="grc">ποθεν</foreign> is also given to Blepyrus as <lb/>
            a denial of the question asked in the <lb/>
            previous part of the fourth line: cf. <lb/>
            infra 389, 976. But this sense, as <lb/>
            Brunck remarks, is hardly compatible <lb/>
            with the <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐκ</foreign> which follows. For the <lb/>

            H. is in accord with the older arrange­ <lb/>

            mencement of the line, which is its <lb/>
            way of introducing a new speaker. <lb/>
            Brunck refers to very similar passages <lb/>
            in Terence, Andr. iv. 6, 6; Eun. iii. <lb/>
            4, 7: and on the whole it seems better <lb/>

            <foreign xml:lang="grc">φύλαττε</foreign>, and has ousted a verb signifying <lb/>
            the damage feared, whether detection, <lb/>

            and the two following lines; and the <lb/>
            best way of filling the lacuna, in my <lb/>
            opinion, is by supplying (with Valcke­ <lb/>
            naer) from Birds 424, Thesm. 666 the <lb/>
            words ra <foreign xml:lang="grc">τῆδε καὶ</foreign>. It seems clear, <lb/>
             <pb n="204"/>
            however, that unless another imperative <lb/>
            is introduced, as is done by Blaydes, <lb/>
            the <foreign xml:lang="grc">καὶ</foreign> before <foreign xml:lang="grc">περισκοπουμένη</foreign> cannot <lb/>
            stand, and Bentley's suggestion to <lb/>
            substitute <foreign xml:lang="grc">εὐ</foreign> is adopted by Velsen. But <lb/>
            I think that the corruption goes a little <lb/>
            deeper, and that the specific directions <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">τἀκεῖσε κ.τ. λ</foreign>. would have been preceded <lb/>
            by a more general direction such as <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">πανταχῆ</foreign>. See Birds 423; Thesm 665; <lb/>
            Eur. Phoen. 265; and I have therefore <lb/>
            substituted <foreign xml:lang="grc">πανταχῆ</foreign> for <foreign xml:lang="grc">καὶ περι</foreign>-. R. it <lb/>
            may be observed separates <foreign xml:lang="grc">περὶ</foreign> from <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">σκοπουμένη</foreign>. Holden in his first edition <lb/>
            read <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὰ τῆδε</foreign> as I do, but in his later <lb/>
            edition, not seeing his way to prevent <lb/>
            the anacoluthon, left the lacuna un­ <lb/>
            filled. The other suggestions for sup­ <lb/>
            plying it are, <foreign xml:lang="grc">τἀνθένδε καὶ</foreign>, Cobet, which <lb/>
            is vastly inferior to <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὰ τὴδε καὶ</foreign>, but is <lb/>
            accepted by Velsen: <foreign xml:lang="grc">περιστρέφου</foreign> (before <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">τἀκεῖσε</foreign>) Hermann; <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὰ π άν θ</foreign>’ <foreign xml:lang="grc">δρα</foreign> Meineke; <lb/>

            Blaydes, which is probable enough, and <lb/>
            which he places in the text. The MSS. <lb/>
            and earlier editions have <foreign xml:lang="grc">κὰκεῖσε</foreign>, but <lb/>
            Le Fevre suggested <foreign xml:lang="grc">τἀκεῖσε</foreign>, which indeed <lb/>
            seems required by <foreign xml:lang="grc">τἀκ δεξιᾶς</foreign> and is now <lb/>
            universally adopted. <foreign xml:lang="grc">τἀκ δεξιᾶς</foreign> is the <lb/>
            reading of R. and this too was suggested <lb/>
            by Le Fevre and is read by Invernizzi <lb/>

            posed to get rid of the anacoluthon by <lb/>

            by changing the xai before <foreign xml:lang="grc">περισκοπου­ <lb/>

            which in Bergler's edition is introduced <lb/>
            into the text. Brunck, who never did <lb/>
            justice to Bergler, attacked this reading <lb/>
            as follows: " Quod ex Kusteri con­ <lb/>
            jectura in textum intulit Berglerus, <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">χἡμῶν ἵσως κατείπη</foreign>, ineptissimum est. <lb/>

            Ravenna MS. was given to the public, <lb/>
            and entirely confirmed the reading of <lb/>

            ing with Brunck's reading, observed <lb/>

            <foreign xml:lang="grc">φιλόσοφον</foreign> into <foreign xml:lang="grc">φιλόδημον</foreign>, and <foreign xml:lang="grc">ταίσι</foreign> <lb/>
            below into <foreign xml:lang="grc">ταίς σαίσι</foreign>, so manufacturing <lb/>
            out of the first three lines of the choral <lb/>
            ode a couple of heroic hexameters —<foreign xml:lang="grc">νυ̂ν <lb/>

            extremely improbable, metre, and cf. <lb/>

            unmetrical. Brunck indeed omits the <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">τινος</foreign>, and so, he says, “ pulcher emergit <lb/>
            hexameter heroicus.” A choriamb and <lb/>
            Ionic a minore, are of course equivalent <lb/>
            to two dactyls and a spondee, the second <lb/>
            moiety of an heroic hexameter: and the <lb/>
            temptation to alter the preceding verse <lb/>
            into the commencement of the hexa­ <lb/>

            These two lines have had a singular <lb/>
            fate. In all the editions before Brunck, <lb/>
            line 621 disappeared entirely with the <lb/>
            exception of the first two words, the <lb/>
            copyist confusing them with the last <lb/>
            two words: thus, Aldus wrote — <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BELL_67_fig215.jpg"/></figure> <lb/>
              A new form was introduced by Fracini, who wrote — <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BELL_67_fig216.jpg"/></figure> <lb/>
              Fracini’s last five words were obviously <lb/>
              a mere gloss on <foreign xml:lang="grc">τοιου̑τον</foreign>. Then, to use <lb/>
              Kuster's words, "Bisetus utramque lee­ <lb/>
              tionem in unam quasi massam conflat, <lb/>
              ut versum integrum reddat. Bed quid <lb/>

              lari liceret; led quis praestare possit, <lb/>
              ea esse Aristophanis ? " The good sense <lb/>
              of Kuster's last words has been entirely <lb/>
              ignored by subsequent critics, “ qui <lb/>
              multa ubique ariolantur, quae esse Ari­ <lb/>
              stophanis, nemo credeie potest." The <lb/>
              combined verse of which Kuster speaks <lb/>
              is found in the editions which go by <lb/>
              the name of Scaliger and Le Fevre. <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BELL_67_fig217.jpg"/></figure> <lb/>
              These were the three types which, with <lb/>
              inconsiderable variations (such as <foreign xml:lang="grc">σου̑</foreign> <lb/>
              for <foreign xml:lang="grc">του̑</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὑπάρχει</foreign> for <foreign xml:lang="grc">ίπάρξει</foreign>), stood <lb/>
              their ground until Brunch, from P1., <lb/>
              introduced for the first time the two <lb/>
              lines in their entirety. It is not neces­ <lb/>
              sary to go into the details of the earlier <lb/>
              editions, and (with one or two excep­ <lb/>
              tions) the readings given from the <lb/>
              printed editions commence with Brunck.</p>
          <p>621. <foreign xml:lang="grc">περὶ σου̑</foreign> MSS. Brunck changes <lb/>
            this into <foreign xml:lang="grc">περὶ του̑</foreign> ; takes it from Praxa­ <lb/>
            gora, and gives it to Blepyrus, as in the <lb/>
            following line. And he is followed by <lb/>
            subsequent editors except Meineke and <lb/>
            Velsen. Dobree proposed <foreign xml:lang="grc">μαχου̑νται, <lb/>
            περὶ σου̑ θάρρει μὴ δείση̩ς, οὐχὶ μαχου̑νται <lb/>
            Περὶ του̑ μή σοι ξυγκαταδαρθεῖν</foreign> " omnia <lb/>
            scilicet, Praxagorae.” And so Meineke <lb/>
            and (as regards 621) Velsen. But H. <lb/>
            has BA. before the second <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐχὶ μαχου̑νται</foreign>. <lb/>
            And this seems right.</p>

            Both Bisetus and Dobree, as we have <lb/>
            seen, and following them Meineke, <lb/>

            requires the omission of <foreign xml:lang="grc">μὴ</foreign>, and accord­ <lb/>
            ingly, with Velsen, I have substituted <lb/>

            all editions before Dindorf, giving of <lb/>
            course the sentence to Praxagora. Here <lb/>
            again, as at 495 supra and elsewhere, <lb/>
            Brunck's unfair animadversion upon <lb/>
            Bergler met with a speedy retribution. <lb/>
            "Mendose Junta," he says, “ <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὑμέτερον</foreign>, <lb/>

            videns haec ex ipsa sententia mulieri <lb/>
            continuari debcre." Soon afterwards <lb/>
            the Ravenna MS. and (as a matter of <lb/>
            criticism) the supreme authority of <lb/>
            Bentley were found to support the <lb/>
            reading adopted by Bergler; modern <lb/>
            critics have no doubt of its accuracy; <lb/>
            and for my own part the words seem <lb/>
            to me to be appropriate to Blepyrus <lb/>
            only. Praxagora could hardly have <lb/>
            said that her plan for the women bad <lb/>
            something to recommend it. — <foreign xml:lang="grc">τιν᾽</foreign> H. <lb/>

            in F. P1. <foreign xml:lang="grc">οἱ φαυλότεροι</foreign>, as two lines <lb/>
            above, R. H. vulgo. This cannot be <lb/>
            right: and two suggestions have been <lb/>
            made for correcting it. The first is <lb/>
            Tyrwhitt's. “Illud sane <foreign xml:lang="grc">οἱ φαυλότεροι</foreign>, <lb/>
            quod in v. 628 secundo occurrit, et plane <lb/>
            otiosum est, ab Aristophane profectum <lb/>
            esse non possum credere. Libenter <lb/>
            igitur scriberem, stigmate post v. 627 <lb/>
            posita; <foreign xml:lang="grc">Κοὐκ ἐξέσται παρὰ τοῖσι καλοῖς καὶ <lb/>
            τοῖς μεγάλοις καταδαρθεῖν</foreign>.” - Tyrwhitt. <lb/>
            "Tyrwhitti conjecturam probat Por- <lb/>
            Bonus apud Gaisfordium ad Marklandi <lb/>
            Supplices p. 206.” - Elmsley The <foreign xml:lang="grc">τοῖς <lb/>
            μεγάλοις</foreign> is introduced by way of contrast <lb/>
            to <foreign xml:lang="grc">τοῖς μικροῖς</foreign> in the following verse; <lb/>
            but it is not a likely expression in itself, <lb/>
            nor is <foreign xml:lang="grc">τοῖς μικροῖς</foreign> free from suspicion. <lb/>
            I, like others before me, think that the <lb/>
            allusion to Lysicrates in line 630 makes <lb/>
             <pb n="213"/>
            it probable that in line 629 we should <lb/>
            read <foreign xml:lang="grc">σιμοῖς</foreign> for <foreign xml:lang="grc">μικροῖς</foreign>. And if we look <lb/>
            to lines 701-705 infra to see who are <lb/>
            there contrasted with <foreign xml:lang="grc">τοῖς σιμοῖς καὶ τοῖς <lb/>
            αῖσχροῖς</foreign>, we light upon <foreign xml:lang="grc">τοῖς εὐπρεπέσιν</foreign>. <lb/>
            So that, following Tyrwhitt's lead, we <lb/>
            might read here: <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BELL_67_fig218.jpg"/></figure> <lb/>
              The second suggestion is by Hirschig, <lb/>
              who would omit the words <foreign xml:lang="grc">καὶ τηρήσουσ᾽ <lb/>
              ἐπὶ τοῖσιν δημοσίοισιν οἱ φαυλότεροι</foreign> as <lb/>
              a gloss, and read <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀπό τοῦ δείπνου, κοὐκ</foreign> <lb/>
              'flarat <foreign xml:lang="grc">π</foreign>apa <foreign xml:lang="grc">τοῖσι καλοῖς καταδαρθεῖν</foreign>. <lb/>
              This also seems to me very probable. <lb/>
              On the whole, however, I have thought <lb/>
              it better to retain the lines unaltered, <lb/>
              merely, with Dindorf and Bergk, en­ <lb/>
              closing the second <foreign xml:lang="grc">οἱ φαυλότεροι</foreign> in <lb/>
              brackets. Velsen omits them, marking <lb/>
              a lacuna. Meineke gives them to Ble­ <lb/>
              pyrus, placing after them a note of <lb/>
              interrogation: but they would surely <lb/>
              make a very unmeaning question in his <lb/>
              mouth. Blaydes adopts Tyrwhitt's <lb/>
              suggestion. I had not observed that <lb/>
              Blaydes also suggests for <foreign xml:lang="grc">καὶ</foreign> ToP, <foreign xml:lang="grc">μεγά­ <lb/>
              λοις</foreign> either <foreign xml:lang="grc">καὶ τοῖς σεμνοῖς</foreign> or <foreign xml:lang="grc">τοῖς</foreign> r' <lb/>

            οῦπος</foreign> R. This last reading looks very <lb/>

            ingly reads <foreign xml:lang="grc">τουτὶ του̃πος σ</foreign>', in which <lb/>
            he is followed by Holden and Velsen. <lb/>
            Between these two readings <foreign xml:lang="grc">τουτὶ δι <lb/>
            πόσους</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">τουτὶ του̃πος σε</foreign>, it is very <lb/>
            difficult to decide. The latter comes <lb/>
            nearer to the MSS., and the rejoinder <lb/>
            of Chremes, which immediately follows, <lb/>
            is perhaps more suitable to a definite <lb/>
            statement made than to a question <lb/>
            put by the preceding speaker, though <lb/>
            the question sufficiently indicates the <lb/>
            speaker's opinion. On the other hand <lb/>
            the former reading is far more in <lb/>
            the tone which Blepyrus has assumed <lb/>
            throughout the dialogue, and is just <lb/>
            like his interruption in 562 supra. And <lb/>
            on the whole, though with great hesita­ <lb/>

            that this was not in accordance with <lb/>
            Attic usage. "Nam Attici," he said, non <lb/>
            solent vocabulum <foreign xml:lang="grc">ε</foreign> post articulum TO <lb/>
            elidere, sed potius per crasin duas illas <lb/>

            for TO <foreign xml:lang="grc">ε̃πος</foreign> et sexcenties alia.. It He there - <lb/>
            fore proposed a reading which he found <lb/>
            in Suidas (to which Bentley had already <lb/>
            called attention) <foreign xml:lang="grc">κλέψαι, μετὸναὐτῷ</foreign>. <lb/>
            And Bergler so reads. And this is found <lb/>
            to be the reading of all the MSS. But <lb/>
            both Brunck and Parson pointed out <lb/>
            that the true reading must be <lb/>
            and this is universally accepted.</p>

          <p>669. <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐὂ ἣνγε... πρότερον</foreign>. These words <lb/>
            are taken from Praxagora and given to <lb/>
            Blepyrus (as a question) by Dobree, <lb/>
            Meineke. Holden, and Velsen. But this <lb/>
            is a change for the worse. It leaves <lb/>
            Praxagora's speech a mere pointless <lb/>
            jest: and the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ω̃σπερ πρότερον</foreign> is quite in <lb/>
            her style, as supra 609. For <foreign xml:lang="grc">θύραζ</foreign>' <lb/>
            (MSS. vulgo), Meineke and Holden <lb/>
            write <foreign xml:lang="grc">θύρασ</foreign>', I know not why.</p>
          <p>670. <foreign xml:lang="grc">δώσει</foreign>. Bergk proposes <foreign xml:lang="grc">δώσεις</foreign>, <lb/>
            which Meineke reads. The alteration <lb/>
            must have occurred to everybody, but <lb/>
            the third person is more in accord with <lb/>
            what follows.</p>

            doubtless a correction by P1. to save the <lb/>
            metre, since H. F. P1. and all editions <lb/>
            before Invernizzi read But Inver. <lb/>
            nizzi and all subsequent editors have <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀρ</foreign>'. <lb/>
            Both Invernizzi and Bekker attribute <lb/>
            this reading to R., and I think that this <lb/>
            must be right, for Invernizzi could not <lb/>
            have invented it himself. In 668 they <lb/>
            attribute <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἂρα</foreign> to R. as well as the other <lb/>
            MSS. On the other hand, Velsen flays <lb/>
            that R. reads <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀρα</foreign> in 668, and that with <lb/>
            this exception all the MSS. read <foreign xml:lang="grc">α̃ρα</foreign> <lb/>
            both in 668 and 672. Velsen is a most <lb/>
            careful and excellent transcriber, but <lb/>
            in this case I think that he must be <lb/>
            wrong.—<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἄνθρωποι</foreign> MSS. rulgo. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἄνθρωποι</foreign> <lb/>

            Holden, and Velsen. The other MSS. <lb/>
            have no trace of a Chorus, but Brunck <lb/>
            rightly thought that a Choral Ode must <lb/>
            have dropped out somewhere, and un­ <lb/>
            fortunately fixed its place two lines <lb/>

            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἔγωγ</foreign>’. Still more unfortunately, when <lb/>
            the Ravenna MS. was discovered, Din­ <lb/>

            where it is absolutely required, to the <lb/>

            the patient Chremes, with whom he <lb/>
            has not one single characteristic in <lb/>

              once, is so certain of his own emenda­ <lb/>
              tion that it is only fair to gire his own <lb/>
              words. " We conceive we have dis­ <lb/>
              covered the true reading and explanation <lb/>
              beyond all controversy. Citizen A is <lb/>
              hasting to comply with the decree of <lb/>
              the women that all property must be <lb/>
              collected in a common store, and is <lb/>
              removing all his household goods to <lb/>
              deposit them in the appointed place. <lb/>
              Citizen B is a mocker, and tells him <lb/>
              there is no hurry, that the men are <lb/>
              likely to repent of having committed <lb/>
              the city to the women. A says in the <lb/>
              passage before us, ‘I'd be in a nice fix <lb/>
              if I couldn't find a place to deposit my <lb/>
              goods in,' thinking every one will be in <lb/>
              such a hurry to obey the decree, that <lb/>
              all available space in the agora will be <lb/>
              taken up. To which Citizen B the <lb/>
              mocker replies, if our view of the passage <lb/>
              be right, It would be more reasonable <lb/>
              to fear you would not find room to <lb/>
              throw them, <foreign xml:lang="grc">μὴ γὰρ οὐ βάλοις ὄποι. θάρρει, <lb/>
              καταθήσεις κἀν ἔνης ἔλθῃς</foreign>. You will find <lb/>
              you will have space to put them down <lb/>
              the day after to-morrow, never fear! <lb/>
              At present it would be more reasonable <lb/>
              to fear there will not be room enough <lb/>

            by R. and H. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἅλλη νέα</foreign>. F. and P1. give <lb/>
            her no name. In the earliest editions <lb/>
            she is simply called AA (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἅλλη</foreign>) which <lb/>
            degenerated into <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἅλλη γραυ̑ς</foreign>; and this <lb/>
            is found even in Kuster and Bergler, <lb/>
            though in his notes Bergler points out <lb/>
            that the speaker is a girl. Brunck <lb/>
            gives NE’ both for the girl and for the <lb/>
            youth who presently enters and talks to <lb/>

            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ΝΕΑΝΙΣ</foreign> in full for the girl, and <lb/>

            which Hermann proposed <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἄρηξον</foreign> which <lb/>
            is meaningless, and Velsen reads <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἄνελθε</foreign>. <lb/>

          <p>" Not a mere drily correct version, but a spirited piece, which will give the <lb/>
            English reader a very good idea of the celebrated ‘ Clouds,' and, what is of more <lb/>
            importance, may be perused with pleasure.”—Spectator.</p>
          <p>“ A most successful performance. Not only the meaning and metres of Aristo­ <lb/>
            phanes are faithfully represented, but also his tone and spirit: his sparkling wit, his <lb/>
            pointed raillery, his broad farce, his poetical flights, and the manly vigour of his sober <lb/>
            moods. Even the puns, and other almost untranslatable forms of expression, are <lb/>
            not lost to the English reader. Excellent notes are appended to the Greek text."- <lb/>

          <p>" An able, pleasant, and valuable book. It has a well-written Preface; a care­ <lb/>
            fully prepared text; a readable, sometimes striking, translation; and notes which <lb/>
            are lively and full of literature. We shall be glad to meet Mr. Rogers on this old <lb/>
            classical field again.”—Pall Mall Gazelle.</p>
          <p>" The version is so terse as to run almost line for line with the Greek, while it <lb/>
            is lively enough to tempt the mere English reader, and accurate enough to give <lb/>
            pleasure to the scholar who has the Greek before him. The notes are marked with <lb/>
            a pleasant freshness, and contain much interesting information, and not a little old <lb/>
            Athenian gossip, culled from Athenæus and elsewhere. The critical Appendix is <lb/>
             <pb n="2"/>
            most interesting. The reader will find a remarkably graphic sketch of the feeling <lb/>
            in Greece at this time in Mr. Rogers' Preface. We anticipate with much pleasure <lb/>
            the promise given in the Preface to this play that we may shortly look for a version <lb/>
            of the Thesmophoriazusae from the same pen.”—London Review.</p>
          <p>" The best metrical version which we ever remember to have seen of any of the <lb/>
            Plays of Aristophanes. We hope that so vigorous a translator and so genuine an <lb/>
            admirer of Aristophanes will persevere in his undertaking. General readers will not <lb/>
            easily find another translator who does his work with so much spirit and such evident <lb/>
            enjoyment.”—Spectator.</p>
          <p>"A scholarly translation, so lively yet so literal as to console for the loss which <lb/>
            literature sustains by the unfinished condition of Frere's treatment of the same <lb/>
            Play.”—Saturday Review.</p>
          <p>" In a former translation by Mr. Rogers (as we said at the time), not only the <lb/>
            meaning and metres of Aristophanes are faithfully represented, but also his tone <lb/>
            and spirit: his sparkling wit, his pointed raillery, his broad farce, his poetical <lb/>
            flights, and the manly vigour of his sober moods. The work now before us seems <lb/>
            to have all the merits which distinguished Mr. Rogers's former performance as a <lb/>
            translation, while as a piece of critical editing it is decidedly superior to it. If the <lb/>
            Comedies of Aristophanes are to be naturalized in English, it would not be easy to <lb/>
            find a translator more suited in every way for the task than Mr. Rogers has shown <lb/>
            himself to be. Compared with Frere or Mitchell, he has greatly the advantage in <lb/>
            terseness and compactness, preserving far more of the form of the original; and <lb/>
            though of course such closeness cannot be attained without occasional loss of freedom <lb/>
            and spirit, it is surprising to see how little is really sacrificed.”—Athenæum.</p>
          <p>" Mr. Rogers has translated the ' Peace in a manner bespeaking an ac­ <lb/>
            complished scholar. His aim is to be literal, but not at the expense of readableness, <lb/>
            and the compromise is very cleverly carried into effect. Freedom as regards metre <lb/>
            and expression is recognized within due bounds and under the surveillance of a correct <lb/>
            ear and an unpedantic taste. The result is a very pleasing version. It entitles <lb/>
            him to a rank not far below Walsh and Frere among first-class translators of <lb/>
            Aristophanes.”—Contemporary Review.</p>

          <p>" We have in this Play, as in the ' Clouds' and ' Peace,' the great advantage <lb/>
            of the companionship of Mr. Rogers, whose volumes must be welcomed alike by <lb/>
            the scholar, the antiquary, and the English reader. His translation is a wonderful <lb/>
            success, and catches the Aristophanic tone exactly; in fact we think that neither <lb/>
             <pb n="3"/>
            Mitchell, Walsh, nor Frere comes near him, taking accuracy and spirit both into <lb/>
            account.”— Quarterly Review.</p>

            Mr. Rogers stands on equal grounds with Frere.”—New Quarterly.</p>
          <p>" Consists of text, notes, and translations: the text carefully revised in the <lb/>
            light of that classical erudition which Mr. Rogers is known to possess, the translation <lb/>
            done in a masterly style that may fairly be pronounced in the manner of Frere, <lb/>
            and the notes full of learning and valuable illustration. No commendation could <lb/>
            be too high for most of those portions of the translation done into long rhymed <lb/>
            metres.”—London Quarterly.</p>
          <p>"All students of Aristophanes will feel grateful to Mr. Rogers. It is hardly <lb/>
            too much to say that he has given a new value and interest to the play.”—Saturday <lb/>
            Review.</p>
          <p>" As for the manner in which Mr. Rogers has done his work, it is difficult to <lb/>
            use praise sufficiently high. His notes are full of excellent scholarship and leave <lb/>
            nothing to be desired in the way of explanation. As for his translation, it is simply <lb/>
            a marvel of ease and skill. It would not be too much to say that no English <lb/>
            translation of a classical author surpasses the rhymed portions.”—Spectator.</p>
          <p>“ A delightful rendering of a famous play.”—Educational Times.</p>
          <p>Decidedly the most complete edition as yet published in England. We <lb/>
            earnestly hope that Mr. Rogers will not rest till he has given us the less known <lb/>
            plays with equal completeness.”—Academy.</p>
          <p>" Mr. Rogers has a marvellous facility in metre and rhyme. In the translation, <lb/>
            where all is excellent, it is difficult to select.”—Athenæum.</p>
          <p>" Quite equal to Frere, and somewhat closer to the original.”—Pictorial Times.</p>
          <p>“ Mr. Rogers's success as a translator is so marked, we had almost said so <lb/>
            brilliant, that we cannot but regret that he did not choose a play which would have <lb/>
            afforded freer scope to his powers. Indeed, in his fertility of rhythmic resource, <lb/>
            he may almost be said to rival the inexhaustible wealth of his original.”—Pall Mall <lb/>

          <p>" A clear and accurate text, a capital commentary, and, above all, undoubtedly <lb/>
            the best verse translation of the play which has yet been published. By way of <lb/>
            adding our quota to the chorus of praise which Mr. Rogers's ' Wasps is eliciting, <lb/>
            we need only say that it is his bappiest effort.”—Examiner.</p><pb n="4"/>

          <p>" It is not often that either scholar or critic or student of poetry has before <lb/>
            him a more satisfying book than this version of the 'Lysistrata.' As to the <lb/>
            execution of the Play in detail, and irrespective of the tact and delicacy shown <lb/>
            throughout, it is certainly not less than masterly; and there is an inimitable <lb/>
            litheness and impetuosity of movement in the more difficult and intricate portions of <lb/>
            the dialogue. It is a work which can scarcely be too highly commended.”—London <lb/>
            Quarterly.</p>
          <p>" Every page shows the translator's scholarship, and every difficult passage <lb/>
            gives proof-of his delicacy and good taste.”—Saturday Review.</p>
          <p>" Mr. Rogers is to be congratulated on a translation which, for spirit and <lb/>
            ingenuity of rendering, and for grace and facility of versification, is worthy to take <lb/>
            rank beside his excellent edition of the ‘Wasps.’ To the work, as a whole, we <lb/>
            can hardly give higher praise than to say that it fully sustains Mr. Rogers's <lb/>
            reputation as a translator.”—Pall .all Gazette.</p>
          <p>" A version which preserves to us all the spirit and splendour of the original, <lb/>
            without its coarse jokes and allusions. From this single translation the English <lb/>
            reader will form the best possible impression of the sparkling wit, the pointed <lb/>
            raillery, the unfailing humour, and the strong common sense of the poet's more <lb/>
            sober moods. The spirit of Aristophanes seems to breathe from every line; yet <lb/>
            so easy and unrestrained is its tone that it reads everywhere like an original.”— <lb/>
            Press and St. James's Chronicle.</p>
          <p>" The translation is a marvel of easy elegance, and of fidelity to the spirit, <lb/>
            grace, and rhythmical melody of the original, which loses none of its charms by <lb/>
            the pure English idiom which is here the main feature of the translator's work. It <lb/>
            will be equally acceptable to the scholar and the general reader who will gain from <lb/>
            its pages a better and more faithful impression of the tone and spirit, the fun and <lb/>
            frolic, and the manly vigour and political insight of Aristophanes than from any <lb/>
            other work on him.”—Public Opinion.</p>
          <p>"The translation conveys to English readers in an unusual degree the true <lb/>
            meaning and flavour of the original. The few notes which appear in the present <lb/>
            volume show a remarkably sound and independent opinion.‘—Academy.</p>
          <p>"Mr. Rogers won his spurs in the field of Aristophanic scholarship many <lb/>
            years ago by an admirably executed edition and translation of the ' Clouds'; that <lb/>
            he followed up with a still better one of the ' Peace'; and that by a better again <lb/>
            of the ' Wasps.' The present version is full of the highest intelligence and scholar­ <lb/>
            ship, and what is still more important in a poetic translation, of fine metrical <lb/>
            instinct. We have seldom had to notice a more thoroughly satisfactory rendering <lb/>
            of a classic work into English verse.”—Notes and Queries.</p>
