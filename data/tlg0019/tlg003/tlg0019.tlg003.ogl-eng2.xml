          <p>IT is a question confessedly difficult to answer, in what manner and to <lb/>
            what extent a translator is bound to conform to the conventional decorum <lb/>
            of the age and nation in which he lives: whether he is to omit whatever in <lb/>
            the least degree runs counter to those rules by which an author is now hap­ <lb/>
            pily compelled to abide, a method which would infallibly destroy the whole <lb/>
            humour of some of the most felicitous, and withal the most harmless pas­ <lb/>
            sages of Greek Comedy and Roman Satire, or to follow his author even in <lb/>
            his wildest extravagances, which would in many cases render his translation <lb/>
            unreadable to by far the greater portion of English Society. It has been my <lb/>
            endeavour to steer, as far as has been in my power, clear of either extreme: <lb/>
            to leave nothing in my translation which can justly offend the classical reader : <lb/>
            while at the same time I have not dared entirely to ignore any passage which <lb/>
            seemed necessary to the full understanding of the true position of an author, <lb/>
            who in spite of these occasional blemishes has been at all times venerated as <lb/>
            well as admired, and that too even on moral grounds, by the best and wisest <lb/>
            of mankind. For it must have been something more than the exuberance of <lb/>
            wit which overflows every page of these Comedies, something more than that <lb/>
            brilliancy of sarcastic humour which no imitator has ever approached, and of <lb/>
            which, I sincerely hope and believe, no translation can entirely denude them; <lb/>
            it must have been something beyond all this which has endeared Aristophanes <lb/>
            in such a remarkable degree to so very many great and illustrious names, and <lb/>
            among them, as is well known, to one of the severest Saints of the Christian <lb/>
            Church, the " Glorious Preacher," St. Chrysostom. It was doubtless the ex­ <lb/>
            cellence of their moral doctrines, the practical good sense, which, as Gibbon <note type="footnote"> a 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="IV"/>
            truly remarks, is a faculty rarer and more precious than genius, and with which <lb/>
            Aristophanes can, when he chooses to speak soberly, treat the great questions <lb/>
            of Religion and Politics in Athens, and lay bare the causes of decay which <lb/>
            were hurrying on that bright Republic to internal misery and external ruin. <lb/>
            " Men smile," says Mr. Sewell, in his eloquent Introduction to the Dialogues <lb/>
            of Plato a, " Men smile when they hear the anecdote of one of the most vene­ <lb/>
            rable fathers of the Church, who never went to bed without Aristophanes <lb/>
            under his pillow. But the noble tone of morals, the elevated taste, the sound <lb/>
            political wisdom, the boldness and acuteness of the satire, the grand object, <lb/>
            which is seen throughout, of correcting the follies of the day, and improving <lb/>
            the condition of his country,—all these are features in Aristophanes, which <lb/>
            however disguised, as they intentionally are, by coarseness and buffoonery, <lb/>
            entitle him to the highest respect from every reader of antiquity. There is as <lb/>
            much system in the Comedies of Aristophanes as in the Dialogues of Plato. <lb/>
            No one play is without its definite object: and the state of national education <lb/>
            as the greatest cause of all [the vitiated condition of the public mind] is laid <lb/>
            open in the Clouds. Whatever light is thrown by that admirable play upon <lb/>
            the character of Socrates, and the position which he occupies in the Platonic <lb/>
            Dialogues, it is chiefly valuable as exhibiting in a short but very complete <lb/>
            analysis, and by a number of fine Rembrandt-like strokes, not any of which <lb/>
            must be overlooked, all the features of that frightful school of sophistry, <lb/>
            which at that time was engaged systematically in corrupting the Athenian <lb/>
            youth, and against which the whole battery of Plato was pointedly directed." <lb/>
            Moreover it may be observed that the Clouds is far the purest and the most <lb/>
            refined of all the productions of the Aristophanic Muse: it was an attempt, <lb/>
            as he says himself, to raise Comedy out of a mere coarse and licentious <foreign xml:lang="grc">αἰ­ <lb/>
            σχρολογία</foreign> b to a philosophic and elegant entertainment: an attempt which un­ <lb/>
            fortunately failed, and the result of that failure may be witnessed in most of <lb/>
            the poet's later plays : but an attempt carried out with so much taste and <note type="footnote"> a p. 41. </note><note type="footnote"> b Aristotle says that the New Comedy <lb/>

              vigour, that it would undoubtedly have been the most successful work of <lb/>
              Aristophanes, had it not been for its one great and indelible blemish, its <lb/>
              complete and entire misrepresentation of the character and tendencies of <lb/>
              Socratic philosophy.</p>
          <p>And this, it must be confessed, is another objection to the Play, far more <lb/>
            formidable than the plea, which we have just considered, of its occasional <lb/>
            indelicacy. But even this may be safely disregarded : for it is not difficult to <lb/>
            discover the cause of the enmity which Aristophanes entertained towards <lb/>
            Socrates : nor is it necessary that the character of either the one or the other <lb/>
            should be vilified, (as has too often been done,) to account for it. The spirit <lb/>
            of a new intellectual æra was brooding over Athens : from one extremity of <lb/>
            the Hellenic world to the other, from the coast of Ionia to the coast of Italy, <lb/>
            the movements of philosophy were beginning to make themselves felt. Nor <lb/>
            can it be denied that this change was accompanied by a change for the worse <lb/>
            in the morals and character of the people: the old faith was breaking up, and <lb/>
            no new one was offered to their minds: it cannot be denied that the Athe­ <lb/>
            nians of the Peloponnesian War had degenerated in generosity, in upright­ <lb/>
            ness, in Pan-hellenic patriotism from the men of Marathon and Platæa. And <lb/>
            doubtless there were at Athens many excellent men who sighed for the in­ <lb/>
            tegrity, the honour, the moral rectitude of the good old times; who were <lb/>
            content to live as their fathers lived, to die as their fathers died: to be no <lb/>
            wiser than their ancestors. And this principle though unsound c is neverthe­ <lb/>
            less always respectable, and if sometimes a check to beneficial improvement is <lb/>
            more frequently a guard against rash and hasty innovation. Such a spirit <lb/>
            found an interpreter in Aristophanes: he looked back with regret to the days <lb/>
            when the whole education of an Athenian was " to call for his rations and to say <lb/>
            his Rhyppapæ,” as distinguished, as indeed they were, by the superior simplicity, <lb/>
            honesty, and temperance of their discipline, and he viewed with disgust and <note type="footnote"> c " If all other things fail, men By to <lb/>
            this, that such or such things pleased our <lb/>
            ancestors, and it were well for us if we <lb/>
            could but match them. They set up their <lb/>
            rest on such an answer, as a sufficient con­ <lb/>
            futation of all that can be said : as if this <lb/>
            were a great mischief that any should be <lb/>
            found Miser than his ancestors." Sir <lb/>

            apprehension this whole intellectual tendency which appeared to be bringing <lb/>
            immorality and licentiousness in its train. His fault was that he did not <lb/>
            discriminate : that he did not discern that the tendency was already taking <lb/>
            two directions: that he confounded the efforts of Socrates to go on and build <lb/>
            up a new and better morality in the place of the old which was now irretriev­ <lb/>
            ably undermined, with the sophistical school which would overthrow the old <lb/>
            without substituting anything in its place: that he did not see that the only <lb/>
            way then practicable of resisting the sophistical theories, was the way in which <lb/>
            Socrates was attempting to proceed: that he looked upon their disputes as <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">κεραμέως κεραμεῖ</foreign>, and identifying the two systems which were alike merely in <lb/>
            their onward tendency and intellectual progress, thought he should be doing <lb/>
            God service by acting against the whole. We, with the writings of Plato and <lb/>
            Xenophon in our hands, know that he was wrong : but with his own writings <lb/>
            in our hands, that he was honest, who shall dare deny ?</p>
          <p>Still, although the opposition of Aristophanes to the spread of literature on <lb/>
            the score of the blow thereby inflicted on the old principles of virtue and of <lb/>
            honour, must by no means be carelessly confounded with the willing igno­ <lb/>
            rance of such cavillers as the Bestius of Persius, (Sat. vi. 37.), and the Jack <lb/>
            Cade of Shakespeare's Henry the Sixth (' He hath corrupted the youth of our <lb/>
            age by erecting a grammar school,' Part II. Act iv. sc. 7) : and although the <lb/>
            idea of his having been incited to this opposition by pecuniary motives, by <lb/>
            the bribes of Anytus and Melitus, is universally surrendered, and can indeed <lb/>
            be refuted on chronological considerations d, in spite of all this, a deep blot <lb/>
            must always remain upon the memory of Aristophanes, as having forwarded <lb/>
            actually if not intentionally, the foulest deed, save one, that ever disgraced <lb/>
            the annals of mankind, the accusation and execution of Socrates. The words <note type="footnote"> d Mr. Gilbert Cooper in his learned and <lb/>
            ingenious Life of Socrates says, 'Ælian has <lb/>
            made a most egregious blunder when he <lb/>
            says that Melitus was concerned in hiring <lb/>
            Aristophanes to compose it: for Melitus, <lb/>
            when Socrates was brought to his trial <lb/>
            (which was three or four and twenty <lb/>
            years after this play was performed) is <lb/>
            called even then a young man : <foreign xml:lang="grc">νές τίς <lb/>
            μοι φαίνεται καὶ ἀγνώς</foreign>, says Socrates, Eu­ <lb/>
            thyphron ad init. If therefore he was then <lb/>
            a young man, he certainly must have been <lb/>
            too young to have entered into any plots <lb/>
            four and twenty years before that time.' <lb/>

            of the Platonic Apology are too plain to be misunderstood : <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὴν ἀντωμοσίαν</foreign> <figure type="illustration">

              <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐδὲν οὔτε μέγα οὔτε σμικρὸν πέρι ἐπαΐω</foreign>. Apol. 19 B.—It is urged that <lb/>
              twenty years after its publication a Comedy which was not even then success­ <lb/>
              ful could not have had so powerful an influence over the Athenian mind: <lb/>
              but Plato was a contemporary speaking of what he felt and knew : and his <lb/>
              testimony, partial as he was to Aristophanes, must be held fully sufficient to <lb/>
              establish the fact. Doubtless Aristophanes regretted the fatal result: doubt­ <lb/>
              less he would join in the universal repentance which pervaded Athens, and <lb/>
              sympathise with those deeply pathetic lines of the Poet whom he uniformly <lb/>
              connected with Socrates, addressed to the Athenian audience,</p><figure type="illustration">

          <p>Ye have slain—ye have slain—the wisest in song, <lb/>
            The Nightingale of Science, who had done you no wrong.</p>
          <p>And it is observed by Meineke that the Poets of the Middle Comedy who at­ <lb/>
            tacked and wrote against Plato, did it in a much more gentle and kindly <lb/>
            spirit than that which animates the Clouds.</p>
          <p>But although an entire misrepresentation of the Socratic philosophy, the <lb/>
            picture in the Clouds is a faithful resemblance of what Mr. Mitchell calls " the <lb/>
            outer Socrates :" so faithful that as Diogenes Laertius f observes, Aristophanes <lb/>
            is often really praising him, when he thinks he is holding him up to derision. <lb/>
            Without this external likeness the satire could not have had its prodigious <lb/>
            effect alike upon the enemies and the friends of Socrates. He himself, con­ <lb/>
            scious as be was of the internal dissimilarity, was, not improbably, the least <note type="footnote"> e Eurip. Palamedes, ap. Diog. Laert., <lb/>

            says his biographer g, " He could afford even to contemn the scoffs of his <lb/>
            assailants." Indeed that Socrates was believed to have disregarded the attack <lb/>
            of the Comedian may be gathered with great probability from the well- <lb/>
            known anecdote recorded by Ælian h that he stood up in his place in the <lb/>
            Theatre the whole time that the play was being acted : that his followers felt <lb/>

            Clouds in the Dialogues i which are extant to this day. But their sense of <lb/>

              may well be presented to the English reader in its full, complete, and undi­ <lb/>

              with Person that there is no man of sound judgment who would not sooner <lb/>
              let his son read Aristophanes than Congreve or Vanbrugh."</p>
          <p>The drama of the Clouds was represented in the Archonship of Isarchus <lb/>
            B.C. 423, when Socrates was about forty-five years old. It gained only <lb/>
            the third - prize: the first was carried off by the aged Cratinus with a drama <lb/>
            called the <foreign xml:lang="grc">Πυτίνη</foreign> or Flagon, which was a humorous adaptation of the attack <lb/>
            made upon him in the preceding year by Aristophanes in his Equites, on the <lb/>
            score of his ultra-convivial habits : Ameipsias with his <foreign xml:lang="grc">Κόννος</foreign> won the second. <lb/>
            Whether, as is said in the didascalia, the defeat of the poet was owing to the <lb/>
            machinations of Alcibiades and other friends of Socrates, cannot be determined <lb/>
            with certainty, but what we know of the character of Alcibiades renders it at <lb/>
            least extremely probable. Disappointed, but not daunted, at the reception <lb/>
            given to this his favourite production, Aristophanes re-formed it anew: the <lb/>
            portions especially pointed out by the ancient grammarians as belonging to <lb/>
            the Second Edition are the Parabasis Proper, the Discussion between the Two <lb/>
            Logics, and the burning of the school of Socrates. The same authorities <lb/>
            state that it was brought forward again in this condition, and received a more <lb/>
            signal defeat (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀποτυχὼν πόλυ μᾶλλον</foreign>) : but Dindorf contends, and makes <note type="footnote"> 1 Bergk. Plat. Epigram. 26. </note> <note type="footnote"> b </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="X"/>
            out a tolerable case to shew, that this Second Edition was never brought on <lb/>
            the stage.</p>
          <p>In my translation of this celebrated Comedy, I have endeavoured to keep <lb/>
            more closely to the original, both in the text and in the metre, than has been <lb/>
            done in any preceding version m. That in some places I have done so more <lb/>
            strictly than in others, is attributable to the fact that I did not determine to <lb/>
            publish the Greek text along with the translation, until I had made consider­ <lb/>
            able progress in the latter, and that determination forbade any further such <lb/>
            alterations in the metre, as I had made (e. g.) in the speech of the Chorus, <lb/>
            1440 etc. As to the degree in which verbal and metrical conformity is ad­ <lb/>
            visable, I agree on the whole with the judicious remarks of Mr. Conington <lb/>
            in the preface to his late able version of the Agamemnon : that mine is not <lb/>
            quite so literal as his, may be ascribed to the fact, that the familiar colloquies <lb/>
            and lively repartees of a Comic Poet do not admit of being rendered, word <lb/>
            for word, into a foreign language, as do the solemn and dignified iambics of <lb/>
            Greek Tragedy : the quaintness inseparable from a scrupulously literal version <lb/>
            serves to adorn the latter, as much as it would spoil and render unmeaning <lb/>
            the former.</p>
          <p>The text I have followed is that of Dindorf, with a few inconsiderable ex­ <lb/>
            ceptions, chiefly consisting in restorations of the older text, where alterations <lb/>
            of his own, of which I could not approve, have been introduced into the later <lb/>
            editions of his Aristophanes.</p>
          <p>With regard to the notes, such remarks as I have quoted from previous <lb/>
            Commentators where they seemed necessary for the right understanding of <lb/>
            the play, are always scrupulously ascribed to their proper owners, and the re­ <lb/>
            fcrences contained in them have been carefully verified; the same is the case <lb/>
            when I have brought quotations from authorities, who either from their more <note type="footnote"> m The only translations of whose existence <lb/>

            more nearly approaches the object I had in <lb/>
            view, but is, I grieve to say, sadly deficient <lb/>
            in that elegance and refinement, which <lb/>
            distinguishes the wildest flights of him, in <lb/>
            whom, as Plato says, the Graces combined <lb/>

            found useful, especially to such as come to the study of Aristophanes with the <lb/>
            feelings with which Persius and all true judges have ever regarded him, not as a mere brilliant but unprincipled caviller at things profane and things <lb/>
            sacred alike, but as a prægrandis senex, a man who threw his whole weight <lb/>
            into the scale of honour, and morality, and virtue, and who although in the <lb/>
            present instance mistaken, completely and irreparably mistaken, in the object <lb/>
            of his Satire, is yet worthy of all praise for the high ground and lofty princi­ <lb/>
            ples on which he took his stand, to oppose the pernicious and most danger­ <lb/>
            ous doctrines of the Sophistical school, which he unfortunately confounded <lb/>

          <p>The following specimens may serve to shew the manner in which Plato <lb/>
            was assailed by the poets of the Middle Comedy. Aristophon, in a comedy <lb/>
            which was called by the name of that philosopher, writes : <figure type="illustration">

            (B) <lb/>
            0 yes, I can tell the tale very well. <lb/>
            For when I was by at our festival high <lb/>
            A troop of these youngsters I chanced to descry, <lb/>
            Wrapt deep in some theme, in the fair Academe ; <lb n="10"/>
            And their language I heard, most strange and absurd ; <lb/>
            They were testing, I saw, some Physical law ; <lb/>
            So it was ; for they tried the world to divide, <lb/>
            Into beasts, into trees, into pot-herbs beside ; <lb/>
            And then they must see in which of the three <lb n="15"/>
            That wonderful thing called a Pumpkin would be. <lb/>

            0 tell me what passed ; in what genus 'twas classed; <lb/>
            And what they agreed to define it at last. <lb/>
            (B) <lb/>
            O first they said nought, but in diligent thought, <lb n="20"/>
            As they stood in a row, stooping down very low, <lb/>
            To fix their attention they strove and they sought; <lb/>
            And in study profound they bent to the ground, <lb/>
            Till one of them deemed the solution was found, <lb/>
            And lifting his head, 'Tis a pot-herb, he said ; <lb n="25"/>
            But another I heard say, 'Tis grass ; and a third, <lb/>
            It seemeth to me that a pumpkin's a tree. <lb/>
            At this answer profound one who stood on the ground, <lb/>
            A doctor from Sicily, slowly turned round, <lb/>
            And with gestures unclean did an action obscene, <lb n="30"/>

            genuity and some plausibility attempts <lb/>
            to prove that under this name Alcihiades <lb/>
            is represented. In proof of this he urges, <lb/>
            not merely the general resemblance of the <lb/>
            two characters, and the known relation in <lb/>
            which Alcibiades stood to Socrates, but <lb/>
            also the manner in which each was con­ <lb/>
            nected by the mother's side with the great <lb/>
            house of the Alemæonidæ, and the rpav­ <lb/>

            he won the first, second, and fourth prizes <lb/>

            tives for that interference of Alcibiades, <lb/>
            of which another grammarian speaks, to <lb/>
            wrest the prize from Aristophanes. Still <lb/>
            no reason can he given why the poet <lb/>
            should not have satirized him under his <lb/>
            own name. The legend of his vengeance <lb/>
            upon Eupolis for his satire in the Baptæ, <lb/>
            is refuted by Eratosthenes (see Cicero <lb/>
            Epistolæ ad Atticum VI. i. 18), and in­ <lb/>
            deed was not pretended to have taken <lb/>
            place until eight years after the represen­ <lb/>

            urge that there would have been as much <lb/>

            Alcibiades, as there was for Clean the year <lb/>

            have found means to retaliate, he would <lb/>
            no doubt have done so with as much pas­ <lb/>
            sion on an underhand, as on an open at­ <lb/>
            tempt to caricature him. Indeed the <lb/>
            fact that the greater part of the play <lb/>
            turns on the poverty and clownish igno­ <lb/>
            rance of the father of Phidippides, seems <lb/>
            to forbid the supposition that he was ex­ <lb/>
            pressly intended to personate Alcibiades ; <lb/>
            the truth seems to be that he was meant <lb/>
            to be the representative of the modern <lb/>
            spirit generally, and in framing that repre­ <lb/>
            sentation many traits were taken from that<lb/>
            distinguished young man, who was already <lb/>
            rising so rapidly into public notice. And <lb/>
            this is probably all that Süvern intended <lb/>

            who says <foreign xml:lang="grc">Φασιανικοὶ</foreign> is the form used to <lb/>
            designate pheasants. I quite agree with <lb/>
            him and Hermann, that Brunck's objec­ <lb/>
            tion to the illogical expression, ' I would <lb/>
            not give up horses for the best breed of <lb/>
            horses in Athens,' goes rather against him <lb/>
            than for him. Poets are often illogical for <lb/>
            effect: so Juvenal, ' The will is as bad as <lb/>
            the deed: and if the mere will is so bad, <lb/>
            how much worse must the deed be.' Sat. <lb/>
            xiii. 209-10. Again, Nature designed man <lb/>
            to defend man in war: instead of this, man <lb/>
            wages war himself.' Sat. xv.; and shortly <lb/>
            after; ' If Pythagoras thought it as bad <lb/>
            to eat brute's flesh as man's, how much <lb/>
            more horrified would he be to hear of <lb/>
            man's flesh being eaten.' I may add in <lb/>
            favour of my version 'racers,' though <lb/>
            more as an illustration than a proof, that <lb/>
            the notorious Andocides, the informer in <lb/>

          <p>STREPS. Socrates ! Socrates !</p>
          <p>one day was taken by Socrates to a build­ <lb/>
            ing in the city of Athens, in which maps <lb/>
            of different countries were collected. The <lb/>
            philosopher directed the attention of his <lb/>
            young friend to a chart of the habitable <lb/>
            world, as far as it was then known to the <lb/>
            geographers of Greece, with the intention <lb/>
            of diminishing the pride in which the <lb/>
            latter appeared to indulge in consequence <lb/>
            of the extent of his territorial possessions <lb/>
            on the Athenian soil. He desired him to <lb/>
            point out the position of Attica on the <lb/>
            map. Alcibiades did so. Now shew me <lb/>
            there, said Socrates, the situation of your <lb/>
            own estate. How is it possible ? replied <lb/>
            the other : can you expect that my do­ <lb/>
            mains should appear there, where even <lb/>
            Attica itself occupies so small a space ?</p>
          <p>213. <foreign xml:lang="grc">παρετάθη</foreign>.]Stretched on the ruck. <lb/>
            This refers to the subjection of Eubœa by <lb/>
            Pericles just before the thirty years' truce, <lb/>
            when the Athenian <foreign xml:lang="grc">κληρουχία</foreign> was planted <lb/>
            at Histiæa. Thucydides, i. 114.</p>
          <p>219. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὦ Σώκρατες</foreign>.] Strepsiades roars <lb/>
            out; Socrates, wrapt in contemplation, <lb/>
            does not hear him. The student, afraid <lb/>
            to interrupt his meditations, excuses him­ <lb/>
            self by suddenly recollecting a press of <lb/>
            business, and retires.</p><pb n="22"/>

            It is frequently used in the same elliptical <lb/>

            Strepsiades means to say, 'It is not so bad <lb/>

          <p>STREPS. 0, first of all, please tell me what you are doing.</p>
          <p>SOCR. I walk on air, and contem-plate the Sun.</p>
          <p>STREPS. 0 then from a basket yon contemn the Gods, <lb/>
            And not from the earth, at any rate ? SOCR. Most true. <lb n="5"/>
            I could not have searched out celestial matters <lb/>
            Without suspending judgment, and infusing <lb/>
            My subtle spirit with the kindred air. <lb/>
            If from the ground I were to seek these things, <lb/>
            I could not find: so surely doth the earth <lb/>
            Draw to herself the essence of our thought. <lb/>
            The same too is the case with water-cress.</p>
          <p>STREPS. Hillo! what's that ? <lb/>
            Thought draws the essence into water-cress ? <lb/>
            Come down, sweet Socrates, more near my level, <lb/>
            And teach the lessons which I come to learn.</p>
          <p>SOCR. And wherefore art thou come? STREPS. To learn to speak. <lb/>
            For owing to my horrid debts and duns, <lb/>
            My goods are seized, I'm robbed, and mobbed, and plundered.</p>
          <p>SOCR. How did you get involved with your eyes open ?</p>
          <p>STREPS. A galloping consumption seized ray money. <lb/>
            Come now : do let me learn the unjust Logic <lb/>
            That can shirk debts : now do just let me learn it.</p>
          <p>homely imagery so familiar to the readers <lb/>
            of Plato and Xenophon. ' To hear Socrates <lb/>
            talk,' says Alcibiades in the Symposium of <lb/>
            Plato, 'appears to a superficial observer <lb/>
            very ridiculous, for his conversation is all <lb/>
            about donkeys, and coppersmiths, and <lb/>
            cobblers, and tanners : but look deeper, <lb/>
            and you will find that there is a hidden <lb/>
            meaning in all this, a meaning full of <lb/>
            virtue, piety, and divinity : like the sculp­ <lb/>
            tured figures of Sileuus, which, without, <lb/>
            are coarse, and rude, and repulsive, but <lb/>
            within, are the images of the Gods.' In <lb/>
            what follows, Strepsiades catches at the <lb/>
            word <foreign xml:lang="grc">κάρδαμα</foreign>, probably the first word he <lb/>
            has thoroughly understood, and after dis­ <lb/>
            playing his utter inability to comprehend <lb/>
            such philosophical language, beseeches his <lb/>
            new master to descend to his level, both <lb/>
            in a physical and in an intellectual sense.</p><pb n="24"/>

            what were the adverse influences which <lb/>
            compelled Byzantium to resort to an iron <lb/>
            circulation. It seems extraordinary that <lb/>
            a city in a situation with such extreme <lb/>
            facilities for commerce, should be reduced <lb/>
            to such a measure from poverty, according <lb/>
            to Professor Hussey's notion. However, <lb/>
            the fact is undoubted, whatever the reason <lb/>

            Don't pass for current coin. STREPS. Eh ? what do you use then ? <lb/>
            Have you got iron, as the Byzantines have ?</p>
          <p>SOCR. Come, would you like to learn celestial matters, <lb/>
            How their truth stands ? STREPS. Yes, if there's any truth.</p>

            Don't sacrifice poor me, like Athamas.</p>
          <p>SOCR. Fear not: our entrance-services require <lb/>
            All to do this. STREPS. But what good comes of it?</p>
          <p>SOCR. You'll be the flower of talkers, prattlers, gossips: <lb/>
            Only keep quiet. STREPS. Zeus ! your words come true ! <lb/>

          <p>SOCR. So then till this day that celestials were they, you never imagined nor knew ?</p>

            'Tis the Clouds who all these support at theirsease, because they exalt them in verse.</p>
          <p>STREPS. 'Tis for this then they write of ‘the terrible might of the light-flashing, rain-splashing Cloud, <lb/>
            And the dankmatted curls, which the Tempest God whirls,' and 'the blasts with their trumpets so loud, <lb/>
            And ' birds of the sky floating upwards on high,' and ‘Clouds of first water, which drown <lb/>
            With their soft falling dew the great Ether so blue,' and then in return they gulp down <lb/>
            Huge cutlets of pike, and game if they like, most delicate game in its season.</p>
          <p>SOCR. And is it not right such praise to requite ? STREPS. Ah, but tell me then what is the reason <lb/>
            That if, as you say, they are Clouds, they to-day are regular women and true ? <lb/>
            For the ones in the air are not women, I swear. SOCR. Why, what do they seem then to you ?</p>
          <p>STREPS. I can't say very well, but they straggle and swell like fleeces spread out in the skies; <lb/>
            Not like women they flit, no, by Zeus, not a bit, but these have mouths, noses, and eyes.</p>
          <p>BOOR. Well, now then, attend to this question, myfriend. STREPS. Look sharp, and propound it to me.</p>

            Xenophantes's heir with his long shaggy hair, or one of those monsters hirsute: <lb/>
            Forthwith they appear like Centaurs, to jeer the ridiculous look of the brute.</p>

          <p>SOCR. Why, his nature to shew to us mortals below, a wolfish appearance they frame.</p>
          <p>STREPS. 0, they then I weed having yesterday seen, Cleonymus quaking with fear, <lb/>
            (Him who threw off his shield as he fled from the field,) metamorphosed themselves into deer.</p>

            Tooke of Greece, as Mr. Sewell calls him, <lb/>
            was a native of Ceos, and a pupil of Pro­ <lb/>

            says Bergler, honoris causâ : and indeed <lb/>
            the Platonic Socrates uniformly speaks <lb/>
            with respect of Prodicus, ‘who was,' as <lb/>
            Müller says, 'the most respectable of all <lb/>
            the Sophists: he used to present lessons <lb/>
            of morality under an agreeable form: <lb/>
            such a moral lesson was the well-known <lb/>
            allegory of the Choice of Heracles.' He <lb/>
            was very fond of drawing subtle distinc­ <lb/>

          <p>Because as you go, you glance to and fro, and in dignified arrogance float, <lb/>
            And think shoes a disgrace, and put on a grave face, your acquaintance with us to denote.</p>

          <p>SOCR. These, these then alone, for true Deities own, the rest are all God-ships of straw.</p>
          <p>STREPS, Let Zeus be left out: He's a God beyond doubt: come, that you can scarcely deny.</p>
          <p>SOCK. Zeus, indeed! there's no Zeus : don't you be so obtuse. STREPS. No Zeus up aloft in the sky! <lb/>
            Then, you first must explain, who it is sends the rain; or I really must think you are wrong.</p>
          <p>SOCR. Well then, be it known, these send it alone : I can prove it by arguments strong. <lb/>
            Was there ever a shower seen to fall in an hour when the sky was all cloudless and blue ? <lb/>
            Yet on a fine day, when the Clouds are away, he might send one, according to you.</p>
          <p>STREPS. Well, it must be confessed, that chimes in with the rest: your words I am forced to believe. <lb/>
            Yet before, I had dreamed that the rain-water streamed from Zeus and his chamber-pot sieve. <lb/>
            But whence then, my friend, does the thunder descend ? that does make me quake with affright!</p>
          <p>SOCR.Why 'tis they, I declare, as they roll through the air. STREPS. What the Clouds? did I hearyou aright ?</p>
          <p>SOCR. Ay : for when to the brim filled with water they swim, by Necessity carried along, <lb/>
            They are hung up on high in the vault of the sky, and so by Necessity strong <lb/>
            In the midst of their course, they clash with great force, and thunder away without end.</p>
          <p>STREPS. But is it not He who compels this to be ? does not Zeus this Necessity send ?</p>
          <p>SOCR. No Zeus have we there, but a Vortex of air. STREPS. What! Vortex? that's something, I own. <lb/>
            I knew not before, that Zeus was no more, but Vortex was placed on his throne ! <lb/>
            But I have not yet heard to what cause you referred the thunder's majestical roar.</p>
          <p>SOCR. Yes, 'tis they, when on high full of water they fly, and then, as I told you before, <lb/>
            By Compression impelled, as they clash, are compelled a terrible clatter to make.</p>

            comedy, the <foreign xml:lang="grc">Δαιταλεῖς</foreign>, or the Feasters. <lb/>
            The following account of that play rests <lb/>
            chiefly on the authority of Müller's His­ <lb/>
            tory of Greek Literature, chap. 28. The <lb/>
            early comedies of Aristophanes, were pro­ <lb/>

          <p>Thou, who at an age like thine, <lb/>
            Seek est with discoveries new <lb/>
            Thine old nature to imbue, <lb/>
            In philosophy to shine.</p>
          <p>O Spectators, I will utter honest truths with accents free, <lb/>
            Yea! by mighty Dionysus, Him who bred and nurtured me. <lb/>
            So may I be deemed a poet, and this day obtain the prize, <lb/>
            As till that unhappy blunder I had always held you wise, <lb/>
            And of all my plays esteeming this the wisest and the best, <lb/>
            Served it up for your enjoyment, which had, more than all the rest, <lb/>
            Cost me thought, and time, and labour : then most scandalously treated, <lb/>
            I retired in mighty dudgeon, by unworthy foes defeated. <lb/>
            This is why I blame your critics, for whose sake I framed the play : <lb/>
            Yet the clever ones amongst you even now I won't betray. <lb/>
            No ! for ever since from judges unto whom 'tis joy to speak, <lb/>
            Brothers Profligate and Modest gained the prize we fondly seek, <lb/>
            When, for I was yet a Virgin, and it was not right to bear, <lb/>
            I exposed it, and Another did the foundling nurse with care, <lb/>
            But 'twas ye who nobly nurtured, ye who brought it up with skill ;- <lb/>
            From that hour I proudly cherish pledges of your sure good will. <lb/>
            Now then comes its sister hither, like Electra in the Play, <lb/>
            Comes in earnest expectation kindred minds to meet to-day ;</p>
          <p>them to appear in his own name : accord­ <lb/>
            ingly he handed them over to two friends, <lb/>
            the political ones to Callistratus, the do­ <lb/>
            mestic ones to Philonides, speaking, as he <lb/>
            says in the Wasps, like a ventriloquist, <lb/>
            through the lips of others. One of these, <lb/>
            it is uncertain which, brought out his first <lb/>
            play, the Dætaleis, B.C. 427. This play <lb/>
            contained a contest between the Old and <lb/>
            New Schools, in the persons of two young <lb/>
            men, Brothers Modest and Profligate. The <lb/>
            latter was represented as a despiser of <lb/>
            Homer, an upholder of all manner of legal <lb/>
            quibbles, a partizan of Thrasymachus, (the <lb/>
            sophist of the Republic of Plato,) and in <lb/>
            all respects a complete rough sketch of the <lb/>
            Unjust Logic of the play before us. In­ <lb/>
            deed if we may judge from one fragment, <lb/>

          <p>530. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀφανίζων πονηρὰ σκώμματα</foreign>.] This <lb/>
            phrase has, I believe, been universally <lb/>
            misunderstood. Dindorf translates it, <lb/>
            after Bergler, ‘dicta mordacia retundens.' <lb/>
            An older Latin version (Aristophanes Bi­ <lb/>
            seti) is, 'amotis e conspectu dictis mor­ <lb/>
            dacibus.' Mitchell gives, making the <lb/>
            wretched scoRers disappear, res pro per­ <lb/>
            sona. The translation in the text seems <lb/>
            scarcely to stand in need of any support: <lb/>
            if any is wanted, there is a very apposite <lb/>
            passage in Aristotle (Poetics 44). Aristotle <lb/>
            is speaking of Homer, who, he says, is <lb/>
            sometimes extravagant, but <foreign xml:lang="grc">τοῖς ἄλλοις <lb/>
            ἀγαθοῖς</foreign> o <foreign xml:lang="grc">ποιήτης ἡγύνων ΑΦΑΝΙΖΕΙ τὸ <lb/>
            ἄτοπον</foreign>, he draws the reader's attention from <lb/>
            his extravagance, by his manifold other <lb/>
            merits : <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀφανίζειν</foreign> has much the same <lb/>
            meaning, infr. 959 ; Thuc. ii. 42 ; Eth. <lb/>
            Nic. III. ix. 3, etc. Thus too we see the <lb/>
            full force of the succeeding verses. They <lb/>
            resort to all kind of manoeuvres, says the <lb/>
            Poet, to draw the attention of the au­ <lb/>
            dience from their TAIIH, mine needs no <lb/>
            such adventitious succour, but comes be­ <lb/>
            fore you <foreign xml:lang="grc">αὑτῇ</foreign> Kat <foreign xml:lang="grc">τυῖς ΕΠΕΣΙΝ πιστεύουσα</foreign>. <lb/>
            For a similar sentiment compare Peace <lb/>
            739—750, Plutus 798. It may be allow­ <lb/>
            able on the same subject to quote the <lb/>
            powerful lines of a living poet, Henry <lb/>
            Taylor, in his drama entitled The Virgin <lb/>
            Widow. Silisco gives the following advice <lb/>
            to some tragic actors.</p>
          <p>Might I speak</p>
          <p>My untaught mind to you that know your art, <lb/>
            I should beseech you not to stare, and gasp, <lb/>
            And quiver, that the infection of the sense</p><pb n="49"/>
            
          <p>She will recognise full surely, if she find, her brothers tress. <lb/>
            And observe how pure her morals : who, to notice first her dress, <lb/>
            Enters not with filthy symbols on her modest garments hung, <lb/>
            Jeering bald-heads, dancing ballets, for the laughter of the young. <lb/>
            In this play no wretched grey-beard with a staff his fellow pokes, <lb/>
            So obscuring from the audience all the poorness of his jokes. <lb/>
            No one rushes in with torches, no one groans, 'Oh, dear ! Oh, dear !' <lb/>
            Trusting in its genuine merits comes this play before you here. <lb/>
            Yet, though such a hero-poet, I, the baldhead, do not grow <lb/>
            Curling ringlets: neither do I twice or thrice my pieces shew. <lb/>
            Always fresh ideas sparkle, always novel jests delight, <lb/>
            Nothing like each other, save that all are most exceeding bright. <lb/>
            I am he who floored the giant, Cleon, in his hour of pride, <lb/>
            Yet, when down I scorned to strike him, and I left him where he died!</p>
          <p>May make our flesh to creep; for as the hand <lb/>
            By tickling of out skin may make us laugh <lb/>
            More than the wit of Plautus, so these tricks <lb/>
            May make us shudder. But true art is this; <lb/>
            To set aside your sorrowful pantomime, <lb/>
            Pass by the senses, leave the flesh at rest, <lb/>
            And working by the witcheries of WORDS <lb/>
            Felt in the fulness of their import, call <lb/>
            Men's spirits from the deep.</p>
          <p>[Since writing the above, I observe that <lb/>
            in a prose translation privately published <lb/>
            by a Mr. Gerard, not otherwise distinguish­ <lb/>
            ed for its sound scholarship, these words <lb/>
            are rendered ‘smuggling his poor jests <lb/>
            through,' which is precisely the meaning <lb/>

            mark, that Aristophanes begins this very <lb/>
            play with the reprobated words <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἰοὺ ἰού</foreign> : <lb/>
            and ends it with the ‘torches.' If the <lb/>
            Scholiast, ad 146, (q. v.) is to be believed, <lb/>
            he alludes there to the baldness of So­ <lb/>
            crates, and it is generally supposed, though <lb/>
            Dindorf and others deny it, that the Clouds <lb/>
            themselves were acted twice. At any rate, <lb/>
            as the Scholiast ad loco observes, in the <lb/>
            Peace <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἔσκωψε τοὺς φαλακροὺς</foreign>, he has in­ <lb/>
            troduced the <foreign xml:lang="grc">κόρδαξ</foreign> into the Wasps, the <lb/>

            Birds; though of course, as Suvern re­ <lb/>
            marks, it is not the introduction, but the <lb/>
            indiscriminate introduction, not the use, <lb/>

            Scholiast refers this to the Graces said to <lb/>
            have been sculptured by Socrates in his <lb/>
            youth, when he followed the trade of his <lb/>
            father Sophroniscus. The following ob­ <lb/>
            servations are quoted from Mr. Gilbert <lb/>
            Cooper's learned Life of Socrates, p. 14. <lb/>
            " Several authors (Suidas, Diog. Laert., <lb/>
            Pausanias) affirm that the celebrated Graces <lb/>
            carved on the walls of the citadel at <lb/>
            Athens behind the statue of Minerva were <lb/>
            his performances. An early indication of <lb/>
            the propensity of his mind to beauty. From <lb/>
            this, compared with his life and doctrines, <lb/>
            (cf. Xen. Mem. iii.) we may perceive what <lb/>
            invariable analogy there is between a taste <lb/>
            for moral and for natural comeliness, for <lb/>
            the same faculties of the soul which lead <lb/>
            mankind to admire proportion and order <lb/>
            in external forms of matter, have a corres­ <lb/>
            pondent relish for a like regularity in cha­ <lb/>
            racters and manners. It is very observable <lb/>
            that these Graces were, contrary to the <lb/>

            Why if the Moon should never rise again, <lb/>
            I'd never pay one farthing. SOCR. No ! why not ?</p>
          <p>STREPS. Why, don't we pay our interest by the month ?</p>
          <p>SOCR. Good ! now I'll proffer you another problem. <lb/>
            Suppose an action : damages, five talents: <lb/>
            Now tell me how you can evade that same.</p>
          <p>STREPS. How! how ! can't say at all: but I'll go seek.</p>
          <p>SOCR. Don't wrap your mind for ever round yourself, <lb/>
            But let your thoughts range freely through the air, <lb/>
            Like beetles with a thread about their feet.</p>
          <p>STREPS. I've found a bright evasion of the action : <lb/>
            Confess yourself, 'tis glorious. SOCR. But what is it ?</p>
          <p>STREPS. I say, haven't you seen in druggists' shops <lb/>
            That stone, that splendidly transparent stone, <lb/>
            Bf which they kindle fire ? SOCR. The burning glass ?</p>
          <p>STREPS. That's it: well then, I'd get me one of these, <lb/>
            And as the clerk was entering down my case, <lb/>
            I'd stand, like this, some distance towards the sun, <lb/>
            And burn out every line. SOCR. By my Three Graces, <lb/>

          <p><foreign xml:lang="grc">ριτας</foreign>, whereas other artists represented <lb/>

            was also Anaxagoras, who although he <lb/>
            was a citizen of Clazomenæ, was within a <lb/>
            few suffrages of being condemned to die, <lb/>
            because he said the sun, which the <lb/>
            Athenians thought to be a God, was a <lb/>

          <p>ners, Mr. Mitchell notices that it has been <lb/>
            observed by Plato, and by persons much <lb/>
            less speculative than Plato; and he quotes <lb/>
            from the speech of the outlaw in Ivanhce <lb/>
            his indignant reproof of those who with <lb/>
            new French graces and traliras disturbed <lb/>
            the ancient English bugle notes, and cor­ <lb/>
            rupted the true old manly blasts of venerie. <lb/>
            Plato treats of this subject in the third and <lb/>
            fourth books of the Republic. " Never," <lb/>
            he says, (424, c.) "according to Damon, <lb/>
            and I quite agree with him, never are the <lb/>
            principles of music changed without a <lb/>
            change in the principles of the Constitu­ <lb/>
            tion." And so Mr. Keble says (Prælec­ <lb/>
            tions, p. 812.), " non facile invenias in <lb/>
            ullâ eivitate, quæ quidem leges moresque <lb/>
            habet stabiles, mutari in gravius et sane­ <lb/>
            tius rem sacram et religiosam, non ante <lb/>
            mutato laudatorum carminum tenore." And <lb/>
            indeed if we look at any musical school, <lb/>
            the Æolian, the Phrygian, the Lydian, the <lb/>
            Dorian, etc., we at once see that the na­ <lb/>
            tional spirit has entered into, and directed <lb/>
            and dictated the whole. See Mr. Brownc's <lb/>
            History of Greek Literature, vol. i. p. 156. <lb/>
            Observe also the extreme jealousy with <lb/>
            which the Spartans regarded any innova­ <lb/>
            tion on the established music. “ Thus <lb/>
            Ecprepes the ephor, on observing that the <lb/>
            cithara of Phrynis had two strings more <lb/>
            than the allowed number, immediately cut <lb/>
            them out; and the same thing is said to <lb/>
            have happened to Timotheus at the Car­ <lb/>
            nean festival." Muller<foreign xml:lang="grc">᾽</foreign>s Dorians, iv. 6. 2.</p>
          <p>958. <foreign xml:lang="grc">κατὰΦρῦιν</foreign>.] Phrynis was a <lb/>
            celebrated musician of Mitylene, who <lb/>
            flourished before, and contemporaneously <lb/>
            with, Aristophanes. The Scholiast says <lb/>
            that he was the first victor in the musical <lb/>
            contests (instituted by Pericles) at the <lb/>
            Panathenæa, B.C. 456, and that he is at­ <lb/>
            tacked by Aristophanes and Aristocrates <lb/>
            (legendum Pherecrates, Meineke. Corn. <lb/>
            Frag. i. 76, note)' for his effeminate in­ <lb/>
            novations in the art of music. The pas­ <lb/>
            sage of Pherecrates to which the Scholiast <lb/>
            refers is given in Plutarch's treatise de <lb/>
            Musicâ. The following translation accepts <lb/>
            the readings of Bekker, who quotes and <lb/>
            emends that passage among his Fragments <lb/>
            of Aristophanes. Pherecrates the Comic <lb/>
            Poet brings on the stage (‘ in his Chiron.' <lb/>
            Meineke) the personification of Music, in <lb/>
            the form and dress of a woman, and in <lb/>
            very sorry plight. Justice meets her and <lb/>
            enquires the reason of her pitiful con­ <lb/>
            dition, to which she replies :</p><pb n="85"/>
            
          <p>Such as Phrynis is fain, and his long-winded train, perversely to quaver and trill, <lb/>
            Many stripes would he feel in return for his zeal, as to genuine Music a foe. <lb/>
            And every one's thigh was forward and high as they sat to be drilled in a row, <lb/>
            So that nothing the while indecent or vile the eye of a stranger might meet; <lb/>
            And then with their hand they would smooth down the sand whenever they rose from their seat, <lb/>
            To leave not a trace of themselves in the place for a vigilant lover to view. <lb/>
            They never would soil their persons with oil but were in artificial and true. <lb/>
            Nor tempered their throat to a soft mincing note and sighs to their lovers addressed:</p>
          <p>Well, I will gladly tell you : for my spirit <lb/>
            quite as fain to speak, as yours to listen. <lb n="10"/>
            The first commencement of my evil days <lb/>
            Was Melanippides: he took and made me <lb/>
            Weak and effeminate with his twelve strings. <lb/>
            I thought him bad enough, but he was pleasant <lb/>
            Compared with what was coming. For then came <lb/>
            That doubly cursed Cinesias of Athens <lb/>
            And with his tuneless, twisting, turning strophes <lb/>
            So utterly undid me, that it seemed 10 <lb/>
            As on the field of battle, so in verse, <lb/>
            His right hand was where his left hand should be. <lb/>
            JUSTICE. He never was so barbarous! Music. Yes, he was though ! <lb/>
            Then Phrynis with some new turn of his own <lb/>
            Bending and twisting, ruined me completely, <lb/>
            With his twelve harmonies on five poor strings. <lb/>
            Yet still he might have seemed pleasant enough <lb/>
            For be would straight amend whate'er he erred in. <lb/>
            But this Timotheus, friend, has undermined <lb/>
            And overthrown me. JUST. Who is this Timotheus? 20 <lb/>
            Whence comes he? Mus. Who? Some sandy-haired Milesian. <lb/>
            He did annoy me sadly, worse than all, <lb/>
            With his outrageous finikin conceits; <lb/>
            And if he met me in my walks alone <lb/>
            Then on his twelve strings would he hack and thwack me <lb/>
            And cram me with his tuneless screeching fifes, <lb/>
            Unholy innovations! twisting me <lb/>
            Like some poor garden plant.</p>
          <p>Lines 11, 12. Hanovius, and apparently <lb/>
            Meineke, take this to be a satire on the <lb/>
            cowardice of Cinesias, insinuating that he <lb/>
            was wont to turn and fly, so that his left <lb/>
            hand would be where his right ought to be. <lb/>

            of the festival of the Buphonia was as fol­ <lb/>
            lows. There was a law of Triptolemus <lb/>
            which forbad the slaughter of the labour­ <lb/>
            ing cattle. (Z<foreign xml:lang="grc">ῶα μὴ σινέσθην</foreign>. vide infra <lb/>

            steer devouring the sacrificial cakes on <lb/>
            the altar of Zeus, drew his knife, and slew <lb/>
            him on the spot. The Buphonia was in­ <lb/>
            stituted to expiate the guilty deed. A <lb/>
            steer was slain, and the parties concerned <lb/>
            in the act shifted the guilt each to his <lb/>
            neighbour, till the knife was accused, con­ <lb/>

            which the Egyptians agreed with the <lb/>
            Spartans, and differed from the rest of <lb/>
            Greece. The respect paid by the Spar­ <lb/>

            Nor dainties to quaff, nor giggle and laugh, nor foot within foot to enfold.</p>

            How old established rules and laws might contradicted be : <lb/>
            And this, as you may guess, is worth a thousand pounds to me, <lb/>
            To take the feebler arguments, and win the disputation. <lb/>
            And mark me now, how I'll confute his boasted Education! <lb/>

            Which was the manliest ? which endured more toils than all the rest ?</p>

          <p>WRONG L. And are the baths of Heracles so wonderfully cold ? <lb/>
            Aha! you blame warm baths, I think. RIGHT L. This, this is what they say: <lb/>
            This is the stuff our precious youths are chattering all the day! <lb/>
            This is what makes them haunt the baths, and shun the manlier Games!</p>

            But if it was so bad, do you think old Homer would have made <lb/>
            Nestor and all his worthies ply a real forensic trade ? <lb/>

            so that the new Moon (the moon's orbit <lb/>
            being 29½ days) always fell on the last <lb/>

            called the Old-and-New, because at the <lb/>
            beginning of the day the moon was still <lb/>
            on the wane, but before the close had <lb/>
            begun to wax again. And this name was <lb/>

          <p>PHEID. Old Solon had a democratic turn.</p>
          <p>STREPS. Well, but that's nothing to the Old-and-New.</p>
          <p>PHEID. Hence then he fixed that summonses be issued <lb/>

            He wished the litigants to meet on that day <lb/>
            And compromise their quarrels: if they could not, <lb/>
            Then let them fight it out on the New-month.</p>
          <p>STREPS. Why then do Magistrates receive the stakes <lb/>

          <p>STREPS. Well from the very first I will the whole contention shew: <lb/>
            'Twas when I went into the house to feast him, as you know, <lb/>
            I bade him bring his lyre and sing, the supper to adorn, <lb/>
            Some lay of old Simonides, as, how the Earn was shorn :</p>
          <p>the guests. Each as he sung took in his <lb/>
            hand a lyre or a sprig of myrtle, as a <lb/>
            badge of minstrelsy, and passed it on, <lb/>
            when he had finished, to his neighbour. <lb/>
            Colonel Mure, (iii. 110,) says that the lyre <lb/>
            was the badge when a song was to be sung, <lb/>
            the myrtle when a passage was to be re­ <lb/>
            cited, and refers to these lines as a proof <lb/>
            of the correctness of this distinction. Phi­ <lb/>

          <p>I may just observe that Mr. Sewell is <lb/>

            goes directly against him. He is equally <lb/>

          <p>But he replied, to sing at meals was coarse and obsolete; <lb/>
            Like some old beldame humming airs the while she grinds her wheat.</p>
          <p>PHEID. And did you not at once deserve a thrashing, at the least, <lb/>
            To bid me sing at meals, as at some old cicala's feast ?</p>
          <p>STREPS. You bear him! so he said just now or e'er high words began : <lb/>
            And next he called Simonides a very sorry man. <lb/>
            And when I heard him, I could scarce my rising wrath command; <lb/>
            Yet so I did, and him I bid take myrtle in his hand <lb/>
            And chant some lines from Æschylus, but he replied with ire, <lb/>
            “Believe me I'm not one of those who Æschylus admire, <lb/>
            That rough, unpolished, turgid froth, that mouther of bombast !" <lb/>
            When he said this, my heart began to heave extremely fast; <lb/>
            Yet still I kept my passion down, and said, Then prithee you, <lb/>
            Sing one of those new-fangled songs which modern striplings do. <lb/>
            And he began the shameful tale Euripides has told <lb/>
            How a brother and a sister lived incestuous lives of old. <lb/>
            Then, then 1 could no more restrain, but first I must confess <lb/>
            With strong abuse I loaded him, and so, as you may guess, <lb/>
            We stormed and bandied threat for threat: till out at last he flew, <lb/>
