          </head>
          <p>IN the present English version of the Comedies of <lb/>
            Aristophanes, the text adopted is that of Dindorf, as re­ <lb/>
            vised for the edition recently published by Didot, which <lb/>
            it may here be observed is a great improvement on that <lb/>
            contained in his Poetæ Scenici. The translator's aim <lb/>
            has been to render the very words of Aristophanes into <lb/>
            English as closely and exactly as the idioms of the two <lb/>
            languages admit, and in illustrating his author the most <lb/>
            approved commentators and versions have been diligently <lb/>
            consulted. Any other mode of proceeding would have <lb/>
            been inconsistent with the profession of a new and <lb/>
            literal translation. Loose paraphrases of difficult Greek <lb/>
            authors,—of which the world has more than enough <lb/>
            already,—would be any thing but new, while an at­ <lb/>
            tempt to improve the author by substituting modern <lb/>
            conceits, or fanciful interpretations, whenever the quaint­ <lb/>
            ness or freedom of the original appeared likely to offend <lb/>
            the reader, would be inconsistent with his professed ob­ <lb/>
            ject. He has endeavoured to give what Aristophanes <lb/>
            actually wrote, as far as could be accomplished in <lb/>
            English words, excepting in passages of extreme indeli­ <lb/>
             <pb n="VI"/>
            cacy, which are necessarily paraphrased. The obscurity <lb/>
            which sometimes arises in the English text from a <lb/>
            strictly literal rendering, has been obviated by explana­ <lb/>
            tory notes, and by extracts from English and German <lb/>
            metrical versions, in which the thoughts are expanded <lb/>
            and freely expressed. The metrical extracts are mostly <lb/>
            taken from Frere, Walsh, Carey, and Wheelwright, and <lb/>
            from the excellent German versions of Voss and Droysen. <lb/>
            The latter of these has afforded most valuable assistance <lb/>
            throughout. That of Voss has been less available, being <lb/>
            so absolutely literal as often to be more difficult than the <lb/>
            Greek itself. Droysen, on the contrary, being ex­ <lb/>
            pressed in easy idiomatic language, may be understood <lb/>
            by any one who can read German at all. In conclusion, <lb/>
            it only remains to observe, that three of the plays now <lb/>
            offered to the public, the Lysistrata, Thesmophoriazusæ, <lb/>
            and Ecclesiazusæ, have never before appeared in English <lb/>
            prose.</p>

            <title type="sub">THE ARGUMENT.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>THIS Comedy takes its name from the natives of Acharnæ, who <lb/>
            constitute the Chorus. In order of time, it is the first entire play <lb/>
            which has come down to us. It was brought out in January, <lb/>
            a. c. 425, 01. lxxxviii. 4, at the Lenæan feast of Bacchus, in the <lb/>
            sixth year of the Peloponnesian war. It obtained the first prize, <lb/>
            the <foreign xml:lang="grc">Χειμαζόμενοι</foreign> of Cratinus the second, and the <foreign xml:lang="grc">Νουμηνία</foreign> of <lb/>
            Eupolis the third. Musgrave and Scaliger, deceived by the cor­ <lb/>
            rupt reading, <foreign xml:lang="grc">Εύθυμένους</foreign>, in the argument, have ascribed it to B. c. <lb/>
            437, although the play itself, vs. 266, mentions the sixth year of the <lb/>
            war, and quotes the Philoctetes of Euripides, vs. 424; and although <lb/>
            the archonship of this Euthymenes is referred to as a distant date, <lb/>
            vs. 67.—See Clinton's Fast. Hell. p. 69, second edition.</p>
          <p>The plot is simply this:—Dicæopolis, an Athenian citizen, but an <lb/>
            Acharnian by birth, tired at the continuance and miseries of the <lb/>
            war, determines, if he cannot persuade the Athenians to adopt his <lb/>
            measures, to make a peace for himself and family. The Athenians, <lb/>
            elated by success, and urged on by the factious demagogues of the <lb/>
            day, refuse to hear of it. Dicæopolis, therefore, despatches Amphi­ <lb/>
            theüs to Sparta, on his own account. A private peace is, concluded, <lb/>
            and its happy results are enumerated with all the festivity and <lb/>
            license conceded to the old Comedy. For the political importance <lb/>
            of Acharnæ, see Thucydides, book ii. c. xix. xx; and for other par­ <lb/>
            ticulars, Anacharsis' Travels, vol. iv, 314, &amp;c., octavo edition. As <lb/>
            tending to elucidate many passages, it may be observed, that <lb/>
            Acharnæ abounded in charcoal works. This was the author's third <lb/>
            play, the two preceding it, the <foreign xml:lang="grc">Δαιταλει̃ς</foreign> (B. c. 427, under the <lb/>
            name of Philonicles), and <foreign xml:lang="grc">Βαβυλώνιοι</foreign> (B. c. 426, at the Great <lb/>
            Dionysia, under the name of Callistratus), not having come down <lb/>
            to us entire.</p><pb n="-"/>

          <p>How many things truly have I been vexed at in my heart; <lb/>
            and with how few have I been pleased, how very few, some <lb/>
            four! while the things I have suffered are countless. Come, <lb/>
            let me see ; at what was I pleased that was worthy of exulta­ <lb/>
            tion ? I know at what I was gladdened in my heart when <lb/>
            I saw it,-at the five talents which Clean disgorged. How I <lb/>
            was transported at this, and for this deed I love the Knights, <lb/>
            for it was worthy of Greece ! But then again I suffered another <lb/>
            woe, a tragic one ; just when1 I was gaping with expectation <lb/>
            for Æschylus, the herald proclaimed, " Theognis,2 introduce <lb/>
            your Chorus." You can't think how this agitated my heart! <lb/>
            But then again I was pleased, when at length Dexitheus en­ <lb/>
            tered, after Moschus,3 to sing a Boeotian strain. And this year <lb/>
            I almost died, and stared my eyes asquint at the sight, when <lb/>
            Chæris strutted forward to chaunt the Orthian strain. But <lb/>
            never at any time since I began to wash, have I been so tor­ <lb/>
            mented in my eyebrows by dust as now, when, the regular <lb/>
            morning assembly being come, the Pnyx here is empty, while <lb/>
            the members in the market-place gossip, and shift up and down <lb/>
            to avoid the vermilion'd rope.4 Neither have the Prytanes <lb/>
            arrived; and when they arrive too late, you can't think5 <lb/>
            how they will jostle each other for the first seat6 rushing <lb/>
            down in a body. But how peace is to be made, they take <note type="footnote"> 1 See Krüger's Greek Gram. § 69, 17, obs. 2. (Eng.

            no heed. 0 city, city! While I, always coming first to the <lb/>
            assembly, take my seat; and there being alone, groan, gape, <lb/>
            stretch and yawn,1 break wind, puzzle, scribble, pluck my <lb/>
            hairs, calculate, looking towards the country, anxious for <lb/>
            peace, disgusted with the city, and longing for my own farm, <lb/>
            which never at any time said, "Buy coals," or "vinegar, or <lb/>
            "oil;" or knew the word "buy,"—but of itself produced all <lb/>
            things, and the " buy" was absent. Now therefore I have <lb/>
            come thoroughly prepared to bawl, interrupt, rail at the ora­ <lb/>
            tors, if any one talk of any thing but peace. But see here <lb/>

              I do not mean the state, but certain rascally fellows, base coin, <lb/>

              Aspasia;7 and hence the beginning of the war broke out for <lb/>

          <p>From the time that our instructor has presided over the <lb/>
            comic choruses, he never yet came forward to the spectators <lb/>
            to tell how clever he is. But being calumniated1 among the <lb/>
            hasty-deciding Athenians by his enemies, that he ridicules <lb/>
            our state and insults the democratic party, he wants now to <lb/>
            make his defence before the changeful Athenians. Now <lb/>
            your poet says he is worthy of much good treatment at your <lb/>
            hands, in that he put an end to your being neatly cajoled by <lb/>
            strangers' words,2 and to your delighting in flattery, and to <lb/>
            your being gaping-mouthed cockneys.3 And formerly the <lb/>
            ambassadors from the cities, trying to cajole you, used first <lb/>
            to call you " violet crowned;" 4 and as often as any one said <lb/>
            this, immediately, by reason of the " crowns," you sat on the tips <lb/>
            of your-bums.5 And as often as any one soft-sawdered you <lb/>
            and called you " sleek Athens," he used to obtain all his wish <lb/>
            through the "sleekness," for having attached to you the glory <lb/>
            of an anchovy.6 By having done this, he has been the cause <lb/>
            to you of many advantages, and from having made known <lb/>
            to you how the people in the cities live under a democracy.7 <note type="footnote"> 1 Another allusion to his Babylonians. See vs. 377, 502. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Bergk supposes the allusion to be to the embassy of Gorgias of <lb/>

            Accordingly, now from the cities they have come, bringing in <lb/>
            to you tribute, desiring to see the best of poets, who had the <lb/>
            hardihood to say amongst the Athenians what is just. And <lb/>
            so far already has the fame of his daring reached, wlren even <lb/>
            the King, questioning the embassy of the Lacedæmonians, <lb/>
            first asked them whether of the two had the superiority at <lb/>
            sea ; and then about this poet,1 which of the two lie plentifully <lb/>
            abused. For he said that those people must have become far <lb/>
            better, and would be far superior in war, who had him as an <lb/>
            adviser. For this reason the Lacedæmonians make you pro­ <lb/>
            posals of peace, and demand back Ægina. And for that <lb/>
            island2 they do not care, but only that they may dispossess <lb/>
            this poet. But do you therefore never give him up, inas­ <lb/>
            much as he will represent in his comedies what is right. <lb/>
            And he says he will teach you mauy good points, so that you <lb/>
            be fortunate, not by wheedling you, nor yet by offering bribes, <lb/>
            nor yet by cheating a little, nor yet by playing the villain, <lb/>
            nor yet by besprinkling you with praise, but by teaching <lb/>
            what is best. Wherefore let Cleon cunningly devise, and con­ <lb/>
            trive every thing against me : for that which is good, and that <lb/>
            which is just with me, shall be my ally; and never will I be <lb/>
            found, like him, a cowardly and effeminate minister of the <lb/>
            state. Come hither, ardent, eager, Acharnian Muse, having <lb/>
            the strength of fire, like as the sparks, roused by the favouring <lb/>

          <p>MEG. I also myself say yes. But who so simple as to buy <lb/>
            you, an evident loss ? However, I have a certain Megarian <lb/>
            device; for I will dress you up as hogs and say I am bring­ <lb/>

            that you appear to be the offspring of a noble sow; since, <lb/>

            what else are you Megarians about now ?</p>
          <p>MEG. Just what we are doing.1 When I set out from <lb/>
            thence, the committee were contriving this for the state, how <lb/>
            we might most quickly and most miserably perish !</p>

          <p>THIS Comedy was performed at the Lenæan Festival, in the <lb/>
            Archonship of Stratocles, 01. Ixxxix. 1, in January, B. C. 424. " In the <lb/>
            eighth year of the war: Aristoph. Equit. 793, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἔτος ὄγδοον</foreign>, computed <lb/>
            from the battle of Potidæa, E. C. 432. The sixth year, mentioned <lb/>
            Aristoph. Acharn., (vide a. 425,) was computed from the invasion <lb/>
            of Attica, eight months afterwards.”—Clinton's Fast. Hell. p. 69.</p>

          <p>In this Drama, which was the first represented in his own name, <lb/>
            the Poet fulfilled his promise, and with the assistance of the Knights, <lb/>
            who here constitute the Chorus, carried off the first prize, and showed <lb/>
            the Demagogue to be <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐς τὰ ἄλλα βιαιότατος τω̃ν πολιτω̃ν τῳ̃ τε δήμῳ <lb/>
            παραπολυ̃ ἐν τῳ̃ τοτε πιθανώτατος</foreign>, (Thucyd. lib. iii. 36,) for he still <lb/>
            remained as great a favourite as ever. The second prize was ad­ <lb/>
            judged to Cratinus, for the Satyrs: the third to Aristomenes, for the <lb/>
            Lamentations. As no artist would make a mask for the character of <lb/>
            Cleon, Aristophanes was obliged to perform the part himself. In <lb/>
            some measure to give an idea of the flushed and bloated countenance <lb/>
            of that Demagogue, he smeared his face with lees of wine, and thus <lb/>
            stood forth in the double capacity of Poet and Actor. A. W. Schle­ <lb/>
            gel (Dramatic Literature, p. 159) remarks, " He bad the prudence <lb/>
            never to name Cleon, though he portrayed him in such a way that <lb/>
            it was impossible to mistake him. No one of his plays, perhaps, is <lb/>
            more historical and political; and its rhetorical power in exciting <lb/>
            our indignation is almost irresistible : it is a true dramatic Philippic. <lb/>
            However, in point of amusement and invention, it does not appear <lb/>
            to me the most fortunate." To understand fully the historical allu­ <lb/>
            sions, it will be necessary to have a recollection of the affair of <lb/>
            Pylos, as recorded by Thucydides, lib. iv. See also Thirlwall, <lb/>
            Hist. Greece, iii. 235—244.</p>
          <p>As there is no plot, the Dramatis Personæ will be a sufficient <lb/>

            purchased pest, together with his schemings ! For since the <lb/>
            time that he entered into our family, he is always inflicting <lb/>

            with our discourse and matter.</p>
          <p>DEM. I will now tell them. We have a master surly in <lb/>
            his temper, bean-fed,4 passionate, Demus of the Pnyx, a crab­ <lb/>
            bed old man, somewhat deaf. He at the previous new5 moon <lb/>
            bought a slave, a tanner of Paphlagonia, most villanous and <lb/>
            most calumniating. This Leather-Paphlagonian, when he <lb/>
            had fully learnt the old man's disposition, by fawning on our <lb/>
            master, used to wheedle,6 cajole, flatter, and deceive him with <lb/>
            tips of leather parings, using such words—“ 0 Demus, when <lb/>
            you have first tried one7 cause, bathe, eat, gobble up, devour, <lb/>
            take the three obols. Would you that I serve up supper to <lb/>
            you ?" Then, having snatched up what any of us may have <lb/>
            prepared, the Paphlagonian makes a present of this to our <lb/>
            master. And lately too, when I bad kneaded a Spartan cake <lb/>
            at Pylos, he somehow circumvented me most knavishly and <lb/>
            filched it away, and served up himself what had been knead­ <lb/>
            ed by me. Us he drives away, and does not suffer any <lb/>
            one else to wait on our master, but with a leather fan, when <lb/>
            at supper, stands and drives away the orators.8 And he re­ <note type="footnote"> faithful historian of the times, Thucyd. vii. 50, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἤν γάρ τι καὶ ἄγαν <lb/>

          <p>DEM. But it is not possible for any thing to escape the <lb/>
            Paphlagonian's notice, for he overlooks all things himself: he <lb/>
            keeps one leg at Pylos, the other in the assembly; and when <lb/>
            he has straddled thus far, his hinder parts are really and <lb/>
            truly among the Chaonians,5 his hands among the Ætolians, <lb/>
            and his mind with the Clopidæ.6</p>
          <p>Nic. Then it is best for us to die. But consider how we <lb/>
            may die most manfully.</p>
          <p>DEM. How, pray, how can it be done, most manfully ?</p>

            become a great man ?</p>
          <p>DEM. For this very reason,2 truly, shall you even become <lb/>

            and impudent.</p>

          <p>DEM. Alas ! whatever's the reason that you say you are <lb/>
            not worthy ? \ou seem to me to be conscious of something <lb/>

          <p>S. S. No, by the gods, unless4 to come of blackguards be so.</p>

            have for statesmanship !</p>
          <p>S. S. But, my good sir, I don't even possess any education, <lb/>
            beyond my letters, and them, to be sure, as bad as bad can be.</p>
          <p>DEM. This alone is an obstacle to you, that you do know <lb/>
            them, even as bad as bad can be. For the character of popular <lb/>
            leader no longer belongs to a man of education, nor yet to one <lb/>
            good in his morals, but7 to the ignorant and abominable. Then <lb/>
            don't neglect what the gods in their oracles offer you.</p>
          <p>S. S. How, pray, does the oracle speak ?</p>
          <p>DEM. Well, by the gods, and ambiguously, in a way, and <lb/>
            learnedly wrapped in riddles. "But when the leather-eagle <lb/>
            with crooked claws shall seize in his beak a serpent, a stupid <lb/>

          <p>S. S. How then does this relate to me ? Instruct me.</p>
          <p>DEM. This Paphlagonian here is the “ leather-eagle."</p>
          <p>S. S. Why is he " with crooked claws ?"</p>
          <p>DEM. It means, I ween, that he snatches and takes away <lb/>
            with his hands curved.1</p>
          <p>S. S. But what's the import of the " serpent?”</p>
          <p>DEM. This is very clear; for the “ serpent " is long, and <lb/>
            the “ sausage " again is long: then both the sausage2 and the <lb/>
            serpent are “ drinkers of blood." It says, therefore, that the <lb/>
            serpent shall immediately conquer the leather-eaglet unless <lb/>
            it be cajoled with words.</p>
          <p>S. S. The oracles please me: but I wonder how I am able <lb/>
            to manage the people.</p>
          <p>DEM. A very easy affair ! Act as you act now; jumble and <lb/>
            mince together all state-affairs, and always win over the peo­ <lb/>
            ple to your side, coaxing it with little cookish words. But <lb/>
            the other requisites for a demagogue you possess - a foul <lb/>
            tongue, you are of vulgar birth, a low fellow; you possess all <lb/>
            things which are requisite for statesmanship. The oracles <lb/>
            and the Delphic shrine conspire in your favour. Crown <lb/>
            yourself then, and offer a libation to Dulness, and see that <lb/>
            you punish the fellow.4</p>
          <p>S. S. And who will be my ally ? for the rich fear him, <lb/>
            and the poor people are afraid of him.</p>
          <p>DEM. But there are a thousand brave knights5 who hate <lb/>

            carrying away from their places, used to bear away the oaks <lb/>

            order that you may hear2 what the herald from Lacedæmon <lb/>
            says, for he has come treating of peace." But they all cried <lb/>
            out with one mouth,—" Now do they talk of peace ? Aye, poor <lb/>
            fool, since they have heard that anchovies are cheap with us. <lb/>
            We don't want peace; let the war go on." And they shouted <lb/>
            that the Prytanes should dismiss the assembly. Then they <lb/>
            leaped over the barriers in every direction. While I slipped <lb/>
            out and bought up all the coriander-seed, and the leeks, as <lb/>
            much as there was in the market: and then gave it gratis to <lb/>
            them who were in want, as seasoning to the anchovies, and <lb/>
            made presents of it. So they all praised me above measure, <lb/>
            and caressed me to such a degree, that I have come, having <lb/>
            gained over the whole senate for an obol-worth 3 of coriander- <lb/>
            seed.</p>
          <p>CHO. Of a truth you have acted in every respect 4 as be­ <lb/>
            comes a man favoured of fortune. The villain has found <lb/>
            another adorned with much greater rascalities and artful de­ <lb/>

            senator, collected very much money in the treasury, by tor­ <lb/>
            turing some, strangling others, and begging of others; not <lb/>
            caring for any private man, provided I gratified you.</p>
          <p>S. S. This, Demus, is no way grand; for I will do this to <lb/>
            you. For I will snatch away and serve up to you other peo­ <lb/>
            ple's loaves.2 But I will first teach you this very thing, that <lb/>
            he neither loves you, nor is well-disposed towards you, except <lb/>
            on account of this very thing, that he enjoys your fire-side. <lb/>
            For he does not care about your sitting so uncomfortably upon <lb/>
            the rocks, who fought to the death with the Persians at Ma­ <lb/>
            rathon for our country, and when victorious, permitted us to <lb/>

            For I myself delight to cry for drink every day, and wish to <lb/>

            take up and strike.</p>
          <p>CHO. And in this way you would be doing well, if, as you <lb/>
            say, very great prudence is in this habit of yours, if you pur­ <lb/>
            posely bring up these in the Pnyx like public victims, and <lb/>

            <title type="sub">THE ARGUMENT.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>STREPSIADES, a wealthy cultivator of the soil in the district of <lb/>
            Cicynna, has been reduced to poverty by the extravagance of his <lb/>
            son. He has heard of the new and wonderful art of reasoning, by <lb/>
            which the Sophists professed to make the worse appear the better <lb/>
            cause ; and hopes that, under the tuition of Socrates, he may attain <lb/>
            to such skill and dexterity of arguing as will enable him to elude <lb/>
            the actions for debt, with which he is threatened by his creditors. <lb/>
            All attempts to make him acquainted with the subtleties of the new <lb/>
            philosophy are found to be vain ; and his son Pbidippides is substi­ <lb/>
            tuted in his stead, as a more hopeful pupil. The youth gives rapid <lb/>
            proof of his proficiency, by beating his father, on their next inter­ <lb/>
            view, and then attempting to demonstrate to him that this proceed­ <lb/>
            ing is right and lawful. The eyes of the foolish old man are <lb/>
            opened to the wickedness of the new doctrines, and the imposture <lb/>
            of their professors. He sets fire to the school of Socrates ; and the <lb/>
            play ends, like most of our modern melodramas, with a grand con­ <lb/>
            flagration. This comedy was first represented at the Great Festival <lb/>
            of Bacchus, (March, B. c. 423,) when Aristophanes was beaten by <lb/>
            Cratinus and Amipsias, through the intrigues of Alcibiades, who <lb/>
            perceived himself aimed at in the character of Phidippides. Aris­ <lb/>
            tophanes was now in his twenty-first year. In consequence of this <lb/>
            defeat, he prepared a second edition, which, we are told, was ex­ <lb/>
            hibited with an equal want of success the following year. But it <lb/>
            is now well ascertained that the play we now have was the original <lb/>
            first edition, with a new ADDRESS, and a few other unimportant <lb/>
            alterations perhaps, and that it was never completed for the stage. <lb/>
            At all events, it mentions Cleon (vs. 591—594) as still living, who <lb/>
            died in the summer of B. c. 422, while the ADDRESS quotes (vs. 553) <lb/>
            the " Maricas " of Eupolis, which was not exhibited till B. c. 421.</p>
          <p>Schlegel (Dramatic Lit. p. 156) remarks, "The most honourable <lb/>
            testimony in favour of Aristophanes is that of the sage Plato, who <lb/>
            transmitted the Clouds (this very play, in which, with the meshes of <lb/>
            the sophists, philosophy itself, and even his master Socrates, was <lb/>
            attacked) to Dionysius the elder, with the remark, that from it he <lb/>
            would be best able to understand the state of things at Athens."</p><pb n="117"/>

            me, forsooth, and to my excellent wife, we squabbled then <lb/>
            about the name: for she was for adding <foreign xml:lang="grc">ϊππος</foreign> to the name, <lb/>
            Xanthippus,l or Charippus, or Callippides ; but I was for <lb/>
            giving him the name of his grandfather, Phidonides. For a <lb/>
            time therefore we disputed; and then at length we agreed, <lb/>
            and called him Phidippides.2 She used to take this son and <lb/>
            fondle him, saying, " When you, being grown up, shall drive <lb/>
            your chariot to the city, like Megacles, with a xystis."3 But <lb/>
            I used to say, " Nay, rather, when dressed in a leathern jerkin, <lb/>
            you shall drive your goats from Phelleus, like your father." <lb/>

          <p>STREP. What then is the use of this?</p>
          <p>Dis. To measure out the land..</p>
          <p>STREP. What belongs to an allotment ?</p>
          <p>Dis. No, but the whole earth.</p>
          <p>STREP. You tell me a clever notion; for the contrivance1 <lb/>
            is democratic and useful.</p>
          <p>Dis. (pointing to a map). See, here's a map of the whole <lb/>

          <p>Dis. Here they are. And Eubcea here, as you see, is <lb/>
            stretched out a long way by the side of it to a great distance.</p>
          <p>STREP. I know that; for it was stretched by us and Peri­ <lb/>

          <p>Dis. Where is it ? Here it is.</p>

            [Exit disciple.]</p>
          <p>STREP. Socrates ! my little Socrates !</p>
          <p>Soc. Why callest thou me, thou creature of a day ?</p>
          <p>STREP. First tell me, I beseech you, what you are doing.</p>
          <p>Soc. I am walking in the air,2 and speculating about the sun.</p>
          <p>STREP. And so you look down upon3 the gods from your <lb/>
            basket, and not from the earth ? if, indeed, it is so.</p>
          <p>Soc. For I should never have rightly discovered things <lb/>
            celestial, if I had not suspended the intellect, and mixed the <lb/>
            thought in a subtle form with its kindred air. But if, being <lb/>
            on the ground, I speculated from below on things above, I <lb/>
            should never have discovered them. For4 the earth forcibly <lb/>
            attracts to itself the meditative moisture. Water-cresses also <lb/>
            suffer5 the very same thing.</p>
          <p>STREP. What do you say?-Does meditation attract the <lb/>
            moisture to the water-cresses ? Come then, my little Socra­ <lb/>
            tes, descend to me, that you may teach me those things, for <lb/>
            the sake of which I have come. [Socrates lowers himself and <lb/>
            gets out of the basket.]</p>
          <p>Soc. And for what did you come ?</p>
          <p>STREP. Wishing to learn to speak; for, by reason of usury, <lb/>
            and most ill-natured creditors, I am pillaged and plundered, <lb/>
            and have my goods seized for debt.</p>
          <p>Soc. How did you get in debt without observing it ?</p>
          <p>STREP. A horse-disease consumed me,—terrible at eating. <lb/>

            gods are not a current coin with us.</p>
          <p>STREP. By what do you swear? By iron money,1 as in <lb/>

          <p>Soc. And to hold converse with the Clouds, our divini­ <lb/>
            ties ?</p>
          <p>STREP. By all means.</p>
          <p>Soc. (with great solemnity). Seat yourself, then, upon the <lb/>
            sacred couch.</p>
          <p>STREP. Well, I am seated!</p>
          <p>Soc. Take, then, this chaplet.</p>
          <p>STREP. For what purpose a chaplet ?—Ah me ! Socrates, <lb/>
            see that you do not sacrifice me like Athamas ! 3</p>
          <p>Soc. No ; we do all these to those who get initiated.</p>
          <p>STREP. Then, what shall I gain, pray ?</p>
          <p>Soc. You shall become in oratory a tricky knave, a <lb/>
            thorough4 rattle, a subtle speaker.-But keep quiet.</p>
          <p>STREP. By Jupiter, you will not deceive me; for if I am <lb/>
            besprinkled, I shall become fine flour.</p>
          <p>Soc. It becomes the old man to speak words of good <lb/>

            clear-bright nature, from loud-sounding father Ocean to the <lb/>

            may behold clearly the far-seen watch-towers, and the fruits, <lb/>

            divine rivers, and the roaring, loud-sounding sea; for the un­ <lb/>

            land of Pallas, to view the much-loved country of Cecrops <lb/>
            abounding in brave men ; where is reverence for sacred rites <lb/>
            not to be divulged; where the house that receives the initiated <lb/>
            is thrown open in holy mystic rites; and gifts to the celestial <lb/>
            gods ; and high-roofed temples, and statues ; and most sacred <lb/>
            processions in honour of the blessed gods ; and well-crowned <lb/>
            sacrifices to the gods, and feasts, at all seasons; and with the <lb/>
            approach of spring the Bacchic festivity, and the rousings <lb/>
            of melodious Choruses, and the loud-sounding music of <lb/>
            flutes.</p>
          <p>STREP. Tell me, 0 Socrates, I beseech you by Jupiter, who <lb/>
            are these that have uttered this grand song ? Are they some <lb/>
            heroines ?</p>
          <p>Soc. By no means; but heavenly Clouds, great divinities <lb/>
            to idle men;2 who supply us with thought, and argument, <lb/>
            and intelligence, and humbug, and circumlocution, and ability <lb/>

          <p>STREP. On this account therefore my soul, having heard <lb/>
            their voice, flutters, and already seeks to discourse subtilely, <lb/>

            to be goddesses ?</p>
          <p>STREP. No, by Jupiter! but I thought them to be mist, <lb/>
            and dew, and smoke.</p>
          <p>Soc. For you do not know, by Jupiter, that these feed very <lb/>
            many sophists, Thurian soothsayers, practisers of medicine, <lb/>
            lazy-longhaired-onyx-ring-wearers,3 and song-twisters for the <lb/>

          <p>STREP. Tell me, pray, if they are really Clouds, what ails <lb/>
            them, that they resemble mortal women ? For they are not <lb/>
            such.</p>
          <p>Soc. Pray, of what nature are they ?</p>
          <p>STEEP. I do not clearly know: at any rate they resemble <lb/>
            spread-out fleeces, and not women, by Jupiter! not a bit;2 <lb/>
            for these have noses.</p>
          <p>Soc. Answer, then, whatever I ask you.</p>
          <p>STEEP. Then say quickly what you wish.</p>
          <p>Soc. Have you ever, when you looked up, seen a cloud3 <lb/>
            like to a centaur, or a panther, or a wolf, or a bull ?</p>
          <p>STREP. By Jupiter, have I! But what of that?4</p>
          <p>Soc. They become all things, whatever they please. And <lb/>
            then, if they see a person with long hair, a wild one of these5 <lb/>
            hairy fellows, like the son of Xenophantes, in derision of his <lb/>
            folly, they liken themselves to centaurs.</p>
          <p>STEEP. Why, what, if they should see Simon, a plunderer <lb/>

          <p>Soc. They suddenly become wolves, showing up his dis­ <lb/>
            position.</p>
          <p>STREP. For this reason, then, for this reason, when they <lb/>
            yesterday saw Cleonymus the recreant, on this account they <lb/>
            became stags, because they saw this most cowardly fellow.</p>

          <p>STREP. But come, by the Earth, is not Jupiter,3 the Olym­ <lb/>

          <p>Soc. What4 Jupiter? Do not trifle. There is no Jupiter.</p>
          <p>STREP. What do you say ? Who rains, then ? For first of <lb/>
            all explain this to me.</p>
          <p>Soc. These, to be sure. I will teach you it by powerful <lb/>
            evidence. Come, where have you ever seen him raining at <lb/>
            any time without Clouds ? And yet he ought to rain in fine <lb/>

          <p>STREP. By Apollo, of a truth you have rightly confirmed <lb/>
            this by your present argument. And yet, before this, I really <lb/>
            thought that Jupiter pissed through a sieve. Tell me who it <lb/>
            is that thunders. This makes me tremble.</p>
          <p>Soc. These, as they roll, thunder.</p>
          <p>STREP. In what way ? you all-daring man !1</p>
          <p>Soc. When2 they are full of much water, and are com­ <lb/>
            pelled to be borne along, being necessarily precipitated when <lb/>
            full of rain, then they fall heavily upon each other and burst <lb/>
            and clap.</p>
          <p>STREP. Who is it that compels them to be borne along ? <lb/>
            is it not Jupiter ?</p>
          <p>Soc. By no means, but æthereal Vortex.</p>
          <p>STREP. Vortex? It had escaped my notice3 that Jupiter <lb/>
            did not exist, and that Vortex now reigned in his stead. But <lb/>
            you have taught me nothing as yet concerning the clap and <lb/>
            the thunder.</p>
          <p>Soc. Have you not heard me, that I said that the Clouds, <lb/>
            when full of moisture, dash against each other, and clap by <lb/>
            reason of their density ?</p>
          <p>STEEP. Come, how am I to believe this ?</p>
          <p>Soc. I'll teach you from your own case. Were you ever, <lb/>
            after being stuffed with broth at the Panathenaïc festival, then <lb/>
            disturbed in your belly, and did a tumult suddenly rumble <lb/>
            through it?</p>
          <p>STREP. Yes, by Apollo, and immediately the little broth <lb/>
            plays the mischief with me, and is disturbed, and rumbles <lb/>
            like thunder, and grumbles dreadfully : at first gently pappax, <lb/>
            pappax; and then it adds papapappax; and when I go to <lb/>
            stool, it thunders downright papapappax, as they do.</p>
          <p>Soc. Consider, therefore, how you have trumpeted from a <lb/>
            little belly so small: and how is it not probable that this air, <lb/>
            being boundless, should thunder loudly ?</p>
          <p>STREP. For this reason, therefore, the two names also, <lb/>
            Trump and Thunder, are similar to each other. But teach <lb/>
            me this, whence comes the thunderbolt blazing with fire, and <note type="footnote"> 1 " Wolf translates this by an epithet applied to the philosopher <lb/>

            burns us to ashes when it smites us, and singes those who sur­ <lb/>
            vive. For indeed Jupiter evidently hurls this at the perjured.</p>
          <p>Soc. Why, how then, you foolish person, and savouring of <lb/>
            the dark ages and antediluvian, if his manner is to smite the <lb/>
            perjured, does he not blast Simon, and Cleonymus, and <lb/>
            Theorus ? And yet they are very perjured. But he smites <lb/>
            his own temple, and Suniurn, the promontory of Athens,1 and <lb/>
            the tall oaks. Wherefore ? for indeed an oak does not com­ <lb/>
            mit perjury.</p>
          <p>STREP. I do not know ; but you seem to speak well. For <lb/>
            what, pray, is the thunderbolt ?</p>
          <p>Soc. When a dry wind, having been raised aloft, is enclosed <lb/>
            in these Clouds, it inflates them within, like a bladder; and <lb/>
            then, of necessity, having burst them, it rushes out with ve­ <lb/>
            hemence by reason of its density, setting fire to itself through <lb/>
            its rushing and impetuosity.</p>
          <p>STREP. By Jupiter, of a truth I once experienced this ex­ <lb/>
            actly at the Diasian festival! I was roasting a haggis for my <lb/>
            kinsfolk, and then through neglect I did not cut it open ; but <lb/>
            it became inflated, and then suddenly bursting, befouled my <lb/>
            very eyes with dung, and burnt my face.2</p>
          <p>CiO. 0 mortal, who hast desired great wisdom from us! <lb/>
            How happy will you become amongst the Athenians and <lb/>
            amongst the Greeks, if you be possessed of a good memory, <lb/>
            and be a deep thinker, and endurance of labour be implanted <lb/>
            in your soul, and you be not wearied either by standing or <lb/>
            walking, nor be exceedingly vexed at shivering with cold, <lb/>
            nor long to break your fast, and you refrain from wine, and <lb/>
            gymnastics, and the other follies, and consider this the highest <lb/>
            excellence, as is proper a clever man should, to conquer by <lb/>
            action and counsel, and by battling with your tongue.</p>
          <p>STREP. As far as regards a sturdy spirit,3 and care that <lb/>

          <p>STREP. 0 mistresses, I request of you then this very small <lb/>
            favour, that I be the best of the Greeks in speaking by4 a <lb/>
            hundred stadia.</p>

            forward from this time no one shall get more opinions passed <lb/>
            in the public assemblies than you.</p>
          <p>STREP. Grant me not to deliver important opinions; for I <lb/>
            do not desire these, but only5 to pervert the right for my own <lb/>
            advantage, and to evade my creditors.</p>

            and could not bear to attack him afterwards when he was <lb/>
            down. But these scribblers, when once Hyperbolus has <lb/>

            by having found a lock of hair at Agamemnon's tomb resembling <lb/>

          <p>Most clever spectators, come, give us your attention; for <lb/>

            education, how it was ordered, when I flourished in the ad­ <lb/>
            vocacy of justice, and temperance was the fashion. In the <lb/>
            first place it was incumbent that no one should hear the <lb/>
            voice of a boy uttering a syllable; and next, that those <lb/>
            from the same quarter of the town should march in good <lb/>
            order through the streets to the school of the Harp-master, <lb/>
            naked, and in a body, even if it were to snow as thick as <lb/>
            meal. Then again, their master2 would teach them, not sit­ <lb/>
            ting cross-legged, to learn by rote a song, either " <foreign xml:lang="grc">Παλλάδα</foreign>3 <lb/>

            been called among the deep thinkers the " worse cause," on <lb/>

            thousand staters, 1 that one should choose the worse cause, and <lb/>
            nevertheless be victorious. But mark how I will confute the <lb/>
            system of education on which he relies, who says, in the first <lb/>
            place, that he will not permit you to be washed with warm water. <lb/>
            And yet, on what principle do you blame the warm baths ?</p>

            And yet, who was more valiant than he?</p>
          <p>JUST. These are the very things which make the bath full <lb/>

            to be deprived-of women, of games at cottabus, of dainties, <lb/>

            any thing else from his farm. For when his olives and vines <lb/>
            sprout, they shall be cut down ; with such slings will we <lb/>

            the Old and New, that the deposits might be made on the <lb/>
            first of the month.</p>
          <p>STREP. Why, pray, did he add the old day ?</p>
          <p>PHID. In order, my good sir, that the defendants, being <lb/>
            present a day before, might compromise the matter of their <lb/>
            own accord; but if not, that they might be worried on the <lb/>
            morning of the new moon.</p>
          <p>STREP. Why, then, do the magistrates not receive the <lb/>
            deposits on the new moon, but on the Old and New ?</p>
          <p>PHID. They seem to me to do what the forestallers do : in <lb/>
            order that they may appropriate the deposits as soon as pos­ <lb/>
            sible, on this account they have the first pick by one day.</p>

          <p>STREP. Well now, I will tell you from what we first began <lb/>
            to rail at one another. After we had feasted, as you know, I <lb/>
            first bade him take a lyre, and sing a song of Simonides,1 <lb/>
            "The Shearing of the Ram." But he immediately said it <lb/>
            was old-fashioned to play on the lyre, and sing while drinking, <lb/>
            like a woman grindiug2 parched barley.</p>
          <p>PaID. For ought you not then immediately to be beaten <lb/>
            and trampled on, bidding me sing, just as if you were enter­ <lb/>
            taining cicadæ ?</p>
          <p>STREP. He expressed,3 however, such opinions then too <lb/>
            within, as he does now; and he asserted that Simonides was <lb/>
            a bad poet. I bore it at first, with difficulty, indeed, yet never­ <lb/>
            theless I bore it. And then I bade him at least take a myrtle­ <lb/>
            wreath4 and recite to me some portion of Æscbylus ; and then <lb/>
            he immediately said, "Shall I consider Æschylus the first <lb/>
            among the poets, full of empty sound, unpolished, bombastic, <lb/>
            using rugged words ?” And hereupon you can't think how <lb/>
            my heart panted. But, nevertheless, I restrained my pas­ <lb/>
            sion, and said, "At least recite some passage of the more <lb/>
            modern poets,5 of whatever kind these clever things be." <lb/>
            And he immediately sang a passage of Euripides,6 how a <lb/>
            brother, 0 averter of ill! debauched his uterine sister. And <note type="footnote"> 1 " 0 ye, who patiently explore <lb/>

              I bore it no longer, but immediately assailed him with many <lb/>

              hurled word upon word. Then be springs upon me; and <lb/>

              me, and killing me.</p>
          <p>PHID. Were you not therefore justly beaten, who do not <lb/>
            praise Euripides, the wisest of Poets?</p>
          <p>STREP. He the wisest! O, what shall I call you ? But I <lb/>
            shall get beaten again.</p>
          <p>PHID. Yes, by Jupiter, with justice.</p>
          <p>STREP. Why, how with justice? Who, 0 shameless fellow, <lb/>
            reared you, understanding all your wishes, when you lisped <lb/>
            what you meant ? If you 1 said bryn, I, understanding it, used <lb/>
            to give you to drink. And when you asked for mamman, I used <lb/>
            to come to you with bread. And you used no sooner to say <lb/>
            caccan, than I used to take and carry you out of doors, and <lb/>
            hold you before me. But you now, throttling me who was <lb/>
            bawling and crying out because I wanted to ease myself, had <lb/>
            not the heart to carry me forth out of doors, you wretch ; but <lb/>
            I did it there, while I was being throttled.</p>
          <p>CHO. I fancy the hearts of the youths are panting to hear <lb/>
            what he will say.3 For if, after having done such things, he <lb/>
            shall persuade him by speaking, I would not take the hide of <lb/>
            the old folks, even at the price of a chick-pea.4 It is thy busi­ <lb/>
            ness, thou author and upheaver of new words, to seek some <lb/>
            means of persuasion, so that you shall seem to speak justly.</p>
          <p>PHID. How pleasant it is to be acquainted with new and <lb/>
            clever things, and to be able to despise the established laws ! <lb/>
            For I, when I applied my mind to horsemanship alone, used <lb/>
            not to be able to utter three words before I made a mistake; <lb/>
            but now, since he himself has made me cease from these pur­ <lb/>

            you interrupted me; and first I will ask you this: Did you <lb/>
            beat me when I was a boy ?</p>
          <p>STREP. I did, through good will and concern for you.</p>
          <p>PaID. Pray tell me, is it not just that I also should be well <lb/>
            inclined towards you in the same way, and beat you, since <lb/>
            this2 is to be well inclined-to give a beating? For why <lb/>
            ought your body to be exempt from blows, and mine not ? <lb/>
            And yet I too was born free. The boys3 weep, and do you <lb/>
            not think it right that a father should weep ? You will say <lb/>
            that it is ordained by law that this should he the lot of boys. <lb/>
            But I would reply, that old men are boys twice over, and that <lb/>
            it is the more reasonable that the old should weep than the <lb/>
            young, inasmuch as it is less just that they should err.</p>
          <p>STREP. It is no where ordained by law that a father should <lb/>
            suffer this.</p>
          <p>PHID. Was it not then4 a man like you and me, who first <lb/>
            proposed this law, and by speaking persuaded the ancients ? <lb/>
            Why then is it less lawful for me also in turn to propose <lb/>
            henceforth a new law for the sons, that they should beat their <lb/>
            fathers in turn ? But as many blows5 as we received before <lb/>
            the law was made, we remit; and we concede to them our <lb/>
            having been well thrashed without return. Observe the <lb/>
            cocks and these other animals, how they punish their fathers ; <lb/>
            and yet, in what do they differ from us, except that they do <lb/>
            not write decrees ? , <note type="footnote"> 1 See Süvern, Clouds, p. 43. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 See note vs. 380, and on Thesm. 520. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 A parody on vs. 691 of the Alcestis of Euripides. Cf. Hec. 1225, <lb/>

          <p>STREP. Why then, since you imitate the cocks in all things, <lb/>
            do you not both eat dung and sleep on a perch ?</p>
          <p>PHID. It is not the same thing, my friend; nor would it <lb/>
            appear so to Socrates.</p>
          <p>STEEP. Therefore do not beat me; otherwise you will one <lb/>
            day blame yourself.</p>
          <p>PHID. Why, how ?</p>
          <p>STEEP. Since I am justly entitled to chastise you; and you <lb/>
            to chastise your son, if you should have one.</p>
          <p>PlaID. But if I should not have one, I shall have wept for <lb/>
            nothing, and you will die laughing at me.</p>
          <p>STREP. To me indeed, 0 comrades, he seems to speak <lb/>
            justly; and I think we ought to concede to them what is fit­ <lb/>
            ting. For it is proper that we should weep, if we do not <lb/>
            act justly.</p>

          <p>PunD. I will beat my mother, just as I have you.</p>

            again, is a greater wickedness.</p>
          <p>PHID. But what if, having the worst Cause, I shall con­ <lb/>

            c. Photo Lex. v. <foreign xml:lang="grc">Τίβιοι</foreign>. Hesych. v. <foreign xml:lang="grc">Παάπις</foreign>’—and flourished in these <lb/>
            times.—Vide Suid. <foreign xml:lang="grc">Λεύκων</foreign>. Philonides, therefore, obtained the <lb/>
            prize with the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ΣΦῆκες</foreign> of Aristophanes; as he obtained the first with <lb/>
            the <foreign xml:lang="grc">Βάτραχοι</foreign> (<foreign xml:lang="grc">Φιλωνίδης έπεγράΦη καί ένίκα</foreign>) in B. C. 405, 01. iv. 93."</p>
          <p>In The Wasps, as in the two preceding Comedies, a knowledge of <lb/>
            the jurisprudence of Athens is absolutely necessary and indispens­ <lb/>
            able. This Drama is a satire on that litigious spirit so prevalent in <lb/>
            every rank at the time of its representation. The plot is soon told. <lb/>
            Philocleon (i. e. a partisan of Cleon) is represented as a bigoted <lb/>
            devotee to that malady most incident to his countrymen. Bdely­ <lb/>
            cleon, his son, (i. e. an opposer of Cleon,) endeavours to persuade <lb/>
            him, by every means in his power, to change his present mode of <lb/>
            life for one of a more noble cast. Every thing fails. At last, he <lb/>
            proposes to convert his own house into a court of justice, and to <lb/>
            remunerate Philocleon for his absence from the public suits. This <lb/>
            succeeds, and the theft of a Sicilian cheese, by a house dog, soon <lb/>
            gives the old gentleman a means of exercising his old craft as dicast. <lb/>
            By an inadvertency he acquits the defendant—<foreign xml:lang="grc">άπατηθεὶςἄκων τἠν <lb/>
            άποδικάζουσαν Φέρει ψῆΦον</foreign>. The Parabasis follows. Afterwards <lb/>
            Philocleon is brought forward in a different point of view, to use <lb/>
            Mr. Mitchell's words, as, " The dicast turned gentleman or, as the <lb/>
            Greek has it, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὄ δὲ γέρων πρὸς αύλὸν καὶ ὄρχησιν τρέπεται, καὶ γελω­ <lb/>
            τοποιεῐ</foreign> TO <foreign xml:lang="grc">δρᾱμα</foreign>. "The Wasps is, in my opinion, the feeblest of <lb/>
            Aristophanes' plays. The subject is too limited, the folly it ridi­ <lb/>
            cules appears a disease of too singular a description, without a <lb/>
            sufficient universality of application, and the action is too much <lb/>
            drawn out. The poet himself speaks this time in very modest lan­ <lb/>

            But do you tell yours first.</p>
          <p>XAN. Methought an eagle, very large, flew down into the <lb/>
            forum, and snatched up in its talons a shield covered with <lb/>
            brass, and bore it aloft towards heaven. And then methought <lb/>
            Cleonymus1 had thrown it away.</p>
          <p>Sos. Cleonymus, then, differs in no wise from a riddle.2 <lb/>
            “ How, pray," some one will say to his drinking companions, <lb/>
            “ happens it that the same beast on the earth, and in heaven, <lb/>
            and in the sea, threw away his shield ?"</p>
          <p>XAN. Ah me ! What evil then will happen to me, who <lb/>
            have 3 seen such a vision ?</p>
          <p>Sos. Do not be concerned, for nothing strange will happen ; <lb/>
            no, by the gods.4</p>
          <p>XAN. Yet, in truth, a man who has cast away his arms, is <lb/>
            a strange thing. Come, tell yours, in return.</p>
          <p>Sos. Why, it is important; for it relates to the whole of <lb/>
            the hull5 of the state.</p>
          <p>XAN. Then tell me quickly the keel of the matter.</p>
          <p>Sos. About my first sleep, some sheep6 sitting together <lb/>
            with staffs and cloaks, appeared to me to be holding an as­ <lb/>
            sembly in the Pnyx. And then, methought a whale, a re­ <lb/>
            ceiveress-general,7 having the voice of a bloated sow, made a <lb/>
            speech to these sheep.</p>

          <p>Sos. And methought Theorus sat near it, on the ground, <lb/>
            with the head of a raven. And then Alcibiades lisped and <lb/>
            said to me, " Do you see ? Theorus has the head of a flat­ <lb/>

          <p>XAN. Rightly did Alcibiades lisp this.</p>

          <p>XAN. By no means, but most proper.</p>
          <p>Sos. How ?</p>
          <p>XAN. How ? Being a man, he then suddenly became a <lb/>

            be raised aloft from us, and go to the ravens ?</p>

              come conspicuous on account of his good fortune, will we again <lb/>
              make mincemeat of the same person. We have a little tale <lb/>
              with a moral in it, than you yourselves not more clever, 1 but <lb/>
              wiser than vulgar comedy. For we have a master there <lb/>
              asleep above, the mighty one, he in the highest floor. He <lb/>
              commanded us two to keep guard over his father, having <lb/>
              confined him within, in order that he may not go forth out of <lb/>
              doors. For his father is indisposed with a strange disease, <lb/>
              which no one could ever hit upon or conjecture, unless lie were <lb/>
              to hear it from us. For guess ! Amynias here, the son of <lb/>
              Pronapus, says he is a lover of dice; but he says nothing to <lb/>
              the purpose.</p>
          <p>Sos. By Jove, he judges of the disease from his own case.</p>
          <p>XAN. No; yet "love" is the beginning of the evil. This <lb/>
            Sosias here says to Dercylus that he is a lover of wine.</p>
          <p>Sos. By no means ; for this is a gentleman's disease.2</p>
          <p>XAN. Nicostratus, of Scambonis, on the other hand, says <lb/>
            that he is fond of sacrificing or fond of hospitality.</p>
          <p>Sos. By the Dog,3 Nicostratus, not fond of hospitality, <lb/>
            since Philoxenus is a blackguard.</p>
          <p>XAN. You talk nonsense to no purpose, for you will not <lb/>
            find it out. If you are truly desirous to know, be silent now; <lb/>
            for I will now declare the disease of our master. He is fond <lb/>
            of the Heliæa, as never man was ; and he loves this acting the <lb/>
            dicast, and groans unless he sit upon the first seat.4 And during <lb/>
            the night he sees not even a morsel of sleep. But in fact, 5 if he <lb/>

              a door, " Pretty Demus,2 son of Pyrilampes," he'd go and write <lb/>
              close by the side of it, "Pretty Cemus."3 And he said that <lb/>
              the cock which used to crow at even, waked him late, having <lb/>
              been prevailed upon, receiving money from those under ac­ <lb/>
              count. And immediately after supper he bawls for his slip­ <lb/>
              pers ; and then, having gone there very early, he sleeps <lb/>
              first, sticking to the column like a limpet. And through mo­ <lb/>
              roseness awarding to all the long line,4 he enters his house like <lb/>
              a bee, or a bumble-bee, having wax stuffed under his nails. And <lb/>
              having feared he might sometime want for pebbles, he keeps <lb/>
              a shingle within, in order that he may be able to act the <lb/>
              dicast. In5 such sort does he rave: and being admonished, <lb/>
              he always acts the dicast the more. Him, therefore, we are <lb/>
              guarding, having shut him in with bars, that he may not get <lb/>
              out ; for his son is grieved at his distemper. And at first <lb/>
              he appeased him with words, and tried to persuade him not to <lb/>
              wear the cloak, and not to go forth out of doors ; but he used <lb/>
              not to obey. Next he washed him and cleansed him. But <lb/>
              he did not much heed it. After this he purified him by <lb/>
              Corybantic rites. But he rushed out together with the kettle­ <lb/>

              But when now he did not profit aught by these ceremonies, <lb/>

              having heard my song, he should creep out of doors under <lb/>

              Has he lost his slippers, or some where in the dark hit his <lb/>

              flamed, being an old man ? And perhaps he may have a <lb/>
              swelling in his groin. Assuredly he used to be far the fiercest <lb/>
              of our company, and alone used not to be persuaded; but <lb/>
              whenever any one supplicated him, he used to bend his head <lb/>
              down in this way and say, " You are boiling a stone." And <lb/>
              perhaps on account of the fellow of yesterday, who escaped us <lb/>
              by deceit by affirming, " That he was a friend of the Athen­ <lb/>

              perhaps lies sick4 of a fever. For the man is just that sort <lb/>
              of a person. Come, my good sir, get up, nor thus torment <lb/>

            hear; although I now, because I wish my father, having <lb/>
            been freed from these early 2-rising base-informing sad-li­ <lb/>
            tigious plaguy ways, to live the life of a gentleman, like <lb/>
            Morychus,3 am accused of doing this because I am a con­ <lb/>
            spirator and favour tyranny.</p>
          <p>PHIL. Aye, by Jove, with justice; for I would not even <lb/>
            accept of bird's milk in preference to this life, of which you <lb/>
            are now for depriving me: nor do I so delight in prickly­ <lb/>
            roaches, or in eels ; but would more gladly eat a little suitlet4 <lb/>

          <p>BDEL. Yes, by Jove, for you have been accustomed to be <lb/>

            dicast to hear there ? Some lament their poverty, and add ills <lb/>
            to their real ones, until, by grieving, he makes his equal to <lb/>

            bribes from the cities at the rate4 of fifty talents, threatening <lb/>

            goblets, cloaks, chaplets, necklaces, drinking cups, health and <lb/>

            impose a single fine only.4 Certainly you always used to do <lb/>
            so there. And this indeed with good reason : if the sun's <lb/>

            sun ; and if it snows, sitting by the fire ; when it rains,5 you <lb/>
            shall go within. And if you get up at noon, no Thesmothetes <lb/>

          <p>BDEL. From me.</p>
          <p>PHIL. Capital! because I shall receive by myself, and not <lb/>
            with another. For in truth Lysistratus,2 the jester, treated me <lb/>
            most shamefully. Lately, when he had received a drachma with <lb/>
            me, he went and changed it in the fish-market ;3 and then he <lb/>
            offered me three mullet-scales, and I put them in my mouth, <lb/>
            for I imagined I had received obols; and then being disgusted, <lb/>
            I smelt at them and spit them out, aud then was for dragging <lb/>
            him to law.</p>
          <p>BDEL. What did he say to this ?</p>
          <p>PHIL. What ? he said I had the stomach of a cock. " At <lb/>
            any rate you will soon digest the money," said he laughing.</p>
          <p>BDEL. Do you see, then, how much this also is which you <lb/>
            will gain ?</p>
          <p>PHIL. Not very small. But do what you are going to do.</p>
          <p>BDEL. Wait then : and I will come with these things. <lb/>
            [Exit. ]</p>
          <p>PHIL. Observe the affair ! How the oracles are fulfilled ! <lb/>
            For I had heard that the Athenians would some time or <lb/>
            other decide causes in their own houses, and that every man <lb/>
            would build4 for himself a little court of justice in his porch, <lb/>
            very small, like a chapel of Hecate, every where before the <lb/>

          <p>BDEL. Lo ! what further will you say ? since I bring you <lb/>
            all, as many as I said, and much more beside. See here ! <lb/>

            monster, he denies having through fear bought him off with <lb/>
            a bribe ; but still even now he fights for you. And he de­ <lb/>

            meaning of our sting, I will readily teach him, even though he <lb/>
            should be unpolished before.1 We to whom this rump is attach­ <lb/>
            ed are Athenians, alone rightfully of noble birth, and of the <lb/>
            native stock ; a most manly race, and one which assisted this <lb/>
            city most of all in battles, when the barbarian came, stifling the <lb/>
            whole city with his smoke, and wasting it with fire, purposing <lb/>
            to take away our combs by force. For we immediately ran <lb/>
            out with spear and with buckler, and fought with them, <lb/>
            having drunk sharp anger, man standing by man,2 biting his <lb/>
            lip through 3 rage ; and by reason of the arrows it was not <lb/>
            possible to see the sky. But, nevertheless, with the gods on <lb/>
            our side, we repulsed them about eventide.4 For, before we <lb/>
            fought, an owl flew over our army. And then we followed, <lb/>
            darting at their trowsers ; but they fled, stung in their jaws <lb/>
            and eye-brows; so that among the barbarians every where, <lb/>

            rightly, nor how we should calumniate any one, but' who <lb/>
            should be the best oarsman. Hence, therefore, having taken <lb/>
            many cities of the Medes, we are the chiefest cause of the <lb/>
            tributes' being brought in hither, which the striplings steal.</p>
          <p>If you often observe us, you will find us in all respects,2 in <lb/>
            our manners and way of living, most like to wasps. For in <lb/>
            the first place, no animal, when irritated, is more irascible, <lb/>
            nor yet more peevish than we. Next, we contrive all the rest <lb/>
            like unto wasps. For being collected in swarms, like the wasps' <lb/>
            nests, some of us act the dicast where the Archon holds his <lb/>
            court; others by the Eleven ; others in the Odeum ; others <lb/>
            crowded together near the walls, frequently bowing the head <lb/>
            to the earth, scarcely moving in their cells, like the grubs. And <lb/>
            we are most full of resources for the rest of our maintenance ; <lb/>
            for we sting every one, and procure a livelihood. But in­ <lb/>
            deed3 drones sit among us, not having a sting ; who lie in <lb/>
            readiness, and devour the fruit of our tribute, not being worn <lb/>
            out with labour. But this is most grievous to us, if any one <lb/>
            who has not seen service, carry off our salary, having received <lb/>
            neither oar, nor spear, nor blister in defence of this country. <lb/>
            But in brief, I move that, whoever of the citizens has not the <lb/>
            regular stingy should not receive his three obols. [Re-enter <lb/>

          <p>PHIL. Never, certainly, while I live, will I strip off this <lb/>
            cloak; since it alone preserved me when drawn up for battle, <lb/>
            when the mighty Boreas invaded me.</p>
          <p>BDEL. You appear to wish to experience nothing good.</p>
          <p>PHIL. No, by Jove, for it is in no wise suitable for me. <lb/>

            away, when now about to practise on the guests. Where­ <lb/>
            fore repay the favour to this my tail. But you will not <lb/>
            repay it, or set about it, I well know ; but will deceive <lb/>
            it, and grin greatly at it; for you have done it already to <lb/>
            many others.1 But if now you will be no ill woman,2 when <lb/>
            my son dies, I will redeem you and keep you as my concu­ <lb/>
            bine, my little pig. But now I am not master of my own <lb/>
            property, for I am young, and am very strictly watched. <lb/>
            For my little son watches me, and he is morose, and a cum­ <lb/>
            min-splitting cress-scraper3 besides. On this account, there­ <lb/>
            fore, he fears for me, lest I should be corrupted ; for he has no <lb/>
            father but me. And see, here he is himself too ! He seems <lb/>
            to be running towards you and me. But stand with these <lb/>
            torches as soon as possible, that I may wantonly mock4 him, as <lb/>
            he once did me before my initiation. [Re-enter Bdelycleon. ]</p>

          <p>PHIL. What flute-girl ? Why do you utter these absurd­ <lb/>

            Astyphilus." Clinton, Fast. Hellen., p. 69. "The Peace of Aristo­ <lb/>
            phanes, according to a recently discovered notice of the Scholiast, <lb/>
            was brought out in the archonship of Alcæus, at the Great Dionysia, <lb/>
            that is, in the March of the year 421. This piece obtained the <lb/>
            second prize, the <foreign xml:lang="grc">Κόλακες</foreign> of Eupolis the first, and the <foreign xml:lang="grc">Φράτοϱες</foreign>; of <lb/>
            Leucon the third." Droysen. The plot is this :—Trygæus, a rustic <lb/>
            patriot, deeply indignant at the continuance of the Peloponnesian <lb/>
            war, resolves to ascend to heaven for the purpose of remonstrating <lb/>
            with Jupiter on the evils which he has been inflicting on the Grecian <lb/>
            cities. He accomplishes his aerial voyage on the back of a gigantic <lb/>
            dung-beetle, which he has fed and trained for this excursion; but <lb/>
            finds that the gods have emigrated from their usual place of resi­ <lb/>
            dence, and that their place in heaven is occupied by the demon of <lb/>
            War, who is occupied in pounding the Greek states in a huge mor­ <lb/>
            tar. His benevolent enterprise is not, however, destined to be <lb/>
            fruitless ; for having learned from Mercury that the goddess Peace <lb/>
            has been shut up in a dungeon, he contrives, by the help of all the <lb/>
            Greek nations, to extricate her from her imprisonment, and descends <lb/>
            with her in triumphal state to earth.-The play concludes with the <lb/>
            restoration of the goddess to her ancient honours, the festivities of <lb/>
            the rural population, and the nuptials of Trygæus, who is but poorly <lb/>
            rewarded for his adventurous flight by receiving the hand of a <lb/>
            nymph of somewhat equivocal reputation. Droysen 2 surmises that <lb/>
            there were two editions put forth by the poet, of which the present <lb/>
            copy is the second. <note type="footnote"> 1 See, however, Droysen's note, as quoted ad 1. c. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 “ Diese ausseren Gründe, in Verbindung mit den oben bezeichneten <lb/>

            kneaded ball to him, as if he were a lady, having beaten it up <lb/>
            the whole day. But I will see if he has ceased from eating, <lb/>
            having opened a little4 of the door in this way, that he may <lb/>
            not see me. [ Goes to the pig-sty and peeps in.] Fall to! <lb/>
            May you never leave off eating till5 you burst unawares. How <lb/>
            the abominable creature stoops down and keeps eating like <lb/>

            round his snout and two paws somehow in this way,7 like <lb/>

            0 damsels, your father is secretly taking his departure for <lb/>

            0 unhappy girls! [Enter daughters of Trygæus.]</p>

          <p>MER. For they are now more thievish than before, 1</p>
          <p>TRY. And I will tell you of a terrible and important thing <lb/>
            which is being plotted against all the gods.</p>

          <p>MER. But wherefore do they do this ? 2</p>
          <p>TRY. Because, by Jupiter, we sacrifice to you, while the <lb/>
            barbarians3 sacrifice to them. On this account naturally they <lb/>
            would wish you all to perish utterly, in order that they alone <lb/>
            of the gods might receive the sacred offerings.</p>

            ously join us in obtaining her, and help to draw her out, and we <lb/>
            will celebrate in honour of you the great Panatbenaic festival, <lb/>

            the festival of Jove, the festival of Adonis in honour of5 <lb/>

          <p>MER. All me! how compassionate I always am towards golden <lb/>
            cups ! Henceforth, sirs, the task is yours.1 But go in and <lb/>
            drag away the stones with your shovels as quickly as possible.</p>
          <p>CiO. This we will do: but do you, 0 wisest of the gods, <lb/>
            stand by and dictate to us in a workmanlike manner, what <lb/>
            we ought to do. For the rest, you will find us not slothful <lb/>
            to follow your directions.</p>

            that we may set about our work, after having prayed to the <lb/>

            omened words ! use no ill-omened words ! [Makes a libation.] <lb/>
            While we pour the libation, let us pray that the present day <lb/>
            may be the beginning3 to the Greeks of many blessings, and <lb/>

          <p>MER. Come now, make proclamation that the husbandmen <lb/>
            depart.</p>
          <p>TRY. Oyez! Oyez! let the husbandmen depart1 as <lb/>
            quickly as possible to the fields with their implements of <lb/>
            husbandry, but without spear and sword and javelin ; since <lb/>
            all things here are now full of ancient peace. But go every <lb/>
            one of you to your work in the field, having sung the Pœan.</p>
          <p>CHO. 0 day, longed for by the just and2 by husbandmen ! <lb/>
            having seen you with delight, I wish to greet my vines ; and <lb/>
            13 have a desire to salute my fig-trees after a very long time, <lb/>
            which I planted when I was younger.</p>
          <p>TRY. Now therefore, 0 men, let us first make our prayers <lb/>
            to the goddess, who has taken away from us the crests and <lb/>
            Gorgons; and then see that we hurry away4 home to our <lb/>
            farms, having purchased some excellent dried fish for the <lb/>
            country.</p>
          <p>MER. 0 Neptune, how goodly their array appears ! and <lb/>
            dense and grim,5 like a barley-cake and a complete banquet!</p>
          <p>TRY. Yes, by Jove ; for the mallet6 is brightly prepared;7 <lb/>
            and their three-pronged forks glitter in the sun. Upon my <lb/>
            word the space between the vines would do well to escape <lb/>
            from them. So that now I myself also am eager to go into <lb/>
            the fields, and to break up with the mattock my little farm <lb/>
            after a length of time.—But, sirs, having remembered the <lb/>
            olden mode of life which she formerly gave us, and those <lb/>
            cakes of preserved fruits, and the figs, and the myrtles, and <lb/>
            the sweet new wine, and the violet-bed beside the well, and <lb/>

            you1 come to us ! For I was overcome with longing for you,2 <lb/>
            wishing prodigiously to return to the country ; for you were <lb/>
            the greatest gain to us, 0 you much-desired goddess ! For <lb/>

            an agricultural life. For formerly we experienced many sweet, <lb/>
            and inexpensive, and dearly-loved pleasures in your time ; for <lb/>
            you have been barley-groats4 and a safe-guard to the husband­ <lb/>
            men ; so that the little vines, and the young fig-trees, and all <lb/>
            the other plants, shall smile upon you, having received you <lb/>
            with joy.—But wherever has she been absent from us this <lb/>
            long time ? Inform us of this, 0 most benevolent of gods.</p>
          <p>MER. Most sapient5 husbandmen, now hear my words, if <lb/>
            you wish to hear how she was lost. Phidias first began the <lb/>
            calamity, having been unfortunate ;7 and then Pericles, fear­ <lb/>
            ing lest he should share his fortune, dreading your disposition <lb/>
            and right stubborn temper, before he suffered any calamity, <lb/>
            with his own hands set the city in a flame, having thrown in <lb/>
            a slight spark of a Megarian decree, and blew up so great a <lb/>
            war, that all the Greeks, both8 here and there, shed tears by <lb/>
            reason of the smoke. And as soon as the vine once crackled9 <lb/>
            in the flames perforce, and wine-cask, being struck, angrily <lb/>
            kicked against wine-cask, no longer was there any one to put <lb/>

          <p>TRY. Now, by Apollo, I had not learned these matters from <lb/>
            any one; nor had I heard how Phidias was connected with <lb/>
            her.</p>
          <p>CHO. Nor I, till now. On this account then she is fair of <lb/>
            feature, because she is a connexion of his.2 Certainly many <lb/>
            things escape our observation.</p>
          <p>MER. And then, when the cities which you ruled over <lb/>
            perceived that you were incensed against each other, and <lb/>
            showing your teeth, through dread of the tribute, they <lb/>
            contrived all stratagems against you, and gained over the <lb/>
            chief men of the Lacedæmonians with money. And they, <lb/>
            since they were sordidly greedy of gain,3 and treacherous <lb/>
            under the mask of hospitality, shamefully rejected this god­ <lb/>
            dess and took up war. And then, their gain was ruin to the <lb/>
            husbandmen ; for the triremes from this country again, taking <lb/>
            vengeance in turn, used to devour the fig-trees of innocent men.</p>
          <p>TRY. Nay, rather, with justice; since of a truth also4 they <lb/>
            cut down my raven-gray fig-tree, which I planted and reared.</p>
          <p>CHO. Yes, by Jove, good sir, certainly with justice ; since <lb/>

            is worthy of great praise. For, in the first place, he alone <lb/>
            of men made his rivals cease always scoffing at the rags and <lb/>

            whom they were always bringing forward weeping, and that <lb/>
            too for this purpose, that a fellow-slave, jeering at his stripes, <lb/>

            first of all I battle with the jagged-toothed monster himself, <lb/>
            from whose eyes the most dreadful rays of Cynna flashed, and <lb/>
            about his head a hundred heads of flatterers—the devil take <lb/>

            torrent bringing forth destruction, the stench of a sea-calf, the <lb/>
            unwashed testicles of a lamia, and the rump of a camel. At <lb/>
            the sight of such a monster, I did not greatly fear ; but, fighting <lb/>
            in defence of you and the other islands, I always withstood <lb/>
            him. On which account now it is reasonable that you should <lb/>
            repay me the favour, and be mindful of it. For aforetime, <lb/>
            when I succeeded according to my wish, I did not tamper with <lb/>
            the boys, going about the Palæstra ; but took up my baggage and <lb/>
            immediately retired, having caused little pain and much pleasure, <lb/>
            and in all things having performed my duty. Wherefore it is fit­ <lb/>

            possible, and wash out the bathing-tub, and heat some water, <lb/>
            and spread for me and her a nuptial couch. And when you <lb/>

          <p>SEE. Whence did you get these ?</p>
          <p>TRY. Whence ? from heaven.2</p>
          <p>SER. I would no longer give three obols for the gods,3 if <lb/>
            they keep prostitutes like us mortals.</p>

            to her to eat ?</p>
          <p>TRY. Nothing : for she will not be willing to eat either <lb/>
            bread or cake, having been always accustomed among the <lb/>
            gods above to lick up ambrosia.</p>

              [Elaphebolion, or March, B. C. 414.] Schol. Av. 998, <foreign xml:lang="grc">καθει̃ται δὲ καὶ</foreign> <lb/>
              o <foreign xml:lang="grc">Μονότροπος ἐπὶ</foreign> roS <foreign xml:lang="grc">αύτου̃ χωρίου</foreign>.”</p>
          <p>This Comedy is a burlesque upon the national Mythology of that <lb/>
            " Blithe race ! whose mantles were bedeck'd <lb/>
            With golden grasshoppers, in sign that they <lb/>
            Had sprung, like those bright creatures, from the soil <lb/>
            Whereon their endless generations dwelt."</p>
          <p>The plot is this. Euelpides and Pisthetairus, two old Athenians, <lb/>
            disgusted with the litigiousness, wrangling, and sycophancy of their <lb/>
            countrymen, resolve upon quitting Attica. Having heard of the <lb/>
            fame of Epops, sometime called Tereus, (<foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸν Τηρέα ε̃ποπα γενόμενον</foreign>, <lb/>
            Arg.,) and now King of the Birds, they determine, under the direc­ <lb/>
            tion of a raven and a jackdaw, to seek from him and his subject <lb/>
            birds a city free from all care and strife. After some scrambling, <lb/>
            their guides intimate to them that they are arrived at the residence <lb/>
            of Epops. They knock, and Trochilus appears, in great alarm, as <lb/>
            he takes them for fowlers. Epops, he informs them, is now asleep, <lb/>
            vs. 82,</p><figure type="illustration">
            <graphic url="ENG_BOHN_01_fig45.jpg"/></figure>
          <p>After some time his Majesty awakes, and, upon their urging their <lb/>
            suit, makes them the offer of several cities. These they refuse, <lb/>
            and Epops descants on the happiness of living among the Birds. <lb/>
            Pisthetairus proposes a scheme to enhance it. Upon this Epops <lb/>
            summons the Nightingale to call the Birds to council. They take <lb/>
            fright, and are about to tear the two old worthies to pieces, imagin­ <lb/>
             <pb n="301"/>
            ing that their king has betrayed them. Epops explains his rela­ <lb/>
            tionship, dwells upon their praise, and thus saves their lives. <lb/>
            Following the advice of Pisthetairus, they build out the gods, and <lb/>
            name their new city Nephelococcygia, or “Cloud-cuckoo-town.” <lb/>
            Arrivals from Athens, "with all their trumpery," are not wanting. <lb/>
            But as by this city in mid-air the gods above are deprived of their <lb/>
            accustomed offerings, at the suggestion of Prometheus, who in <lb/>
            private informs Pisthetairus of their famished state, the latter <lb/>
            considers it a good opportunity for recovering the former dominion <lb/>
            of the Birds, particularly as the Triballian gods, who dwell “extrà <lb/>
            anni solisque vias," are on the point of attacking Jove, in order to <lb/>
            compel him to " open the ports." An embassy arrives, consisting <lb/>
            of Hercules, Neptune, and a certain Triballian god. After some <lb/>
            disputes, it is agreed that the Birds are to be reinstated in their <lb/>
            ancient rights, and that Pisthetairus is to have Basileia as his wife. <lb/>
            The Comedy concludes with the Epitbalamium. See Schlegel, <lb/>
            Dram. Lit. p. 166.</p>
          <p>Frere remarks upon this Comedy, that " its success must have <lb/>
            been a subject of more than usual anxiety both to the poet himself, <lb/>
            and to the Choregus, and all the higher orders of the community. <lb/>
            We may conceive it to have been intended as a sedative to the <lb/>
            minds of the commonalty, excited, as they were at the time, almost <lb/>
            to madness by the suspicion of a conspiracy against the religion and <lb/>
            laws of the country; a suspicion originating in a profane outrage <lb/>
            secretly perpetrated, to a great extent, in mere insolence and <lb/>
            wantonness, by some young men of family. In the opinion, how­ <lb/>
            ever, of the Athenian people, the offence was viewed in a very <lb/>
            serious light, as the result of an extensive secret combination, pre­ <lb/>
            paratory to other attempts still more criminal and dangerous. In <lb/>
            this state of things, and while the popular fury and jealousy upon <lb/>
            religious subjects was at its height, the poet ventured to produce <lb/>
            this play; in which it will be seen, that the burlesque of the na­ <lb/>
            tional Mythology is carried higher and continued longer than in <lb/>
            any of his other existing plays. The first prize was assigned to a <lb/>
            play, the title of which, "The Comastæ,” or " Drunken Rioters," <lb/>
            seems to imply that its chief interest must have been derived from <lb/>
            direct allusions to the outrage above mentioned, and to the indi­ <lb/>
            viduals suspected to have been engaged in it."</p><pb n="302"/>

            oured in tribe and birth, citizens with citizens, have flown away <lb/>

            away; not hating that city itself, so as not to consider it to be <lb/>
            naturally great and wealthy, and common to all to spend their <lb/>
            property in litigation in.4 For the Cicadas, indeed, sing one <lb/>
            month or two upon the branches, while the Athenians are <lb/>
            always singing during their whole life upon lawsuits.5 For <lb/>

            with basket, and pot, and myrtle-branches, in search of a <lb/>
            place free from trouble, where we may settle and live. Now <lb/>

          <p>CHO. How could these ever teach us any thing useful, or <lb/>

          <p>Epops. Yet, certainly, the wise learn many things5 from <lb/>
            their enemies; for caution preserves all things. From a friend <lb/>
            you could not learn this, but your foe immediately obliges you <lb/>
            to learn it. For7 example, the states have learned from <lb/>
            enemies, and not from friends, to build lofty walls, and to <lb/>
            possess ships of war. And this lesson preserves children, <lb/>

          <p>EUEL, Aye, by' Apollo! therefore, it behoves you very <lb/>
            much henceforth to cherish your beak; 1 Jove will not quickly <lb/>
            restore the sceptre to the wood-pecker.</p>
          <p>PISTH, Of this, therefore, there are many proofs, that, not <lb/>
            the gods, but the birds, were rulers and kings over men in <lb/>
            ancient times. For example, I will first point out the cock <lb/>
            to you, how he was sovereign and ruler over the Persians, <lb/>
            before all, before Darius and Megabyzus. So that he is still <lb/>

            the great king.</p>
          <p>PISTH. And so powerful was he, and great, and strong at <lb/>
            that time, that still even now, on account of that p.,wer of <lb/>
            his at that time, when he merely crows at dawn,4 all jump up <lb/>
            to their work-braziers, potters, tanners, shoemakers, bath- <lb/>
            men, corn-factors, lyre-turners, and shield-makers: and they5 <lb/>
            trudge off having put on their shoes in the dark.</p>

          <p>PISTH. You talk nonsense; even Mercury, by Jove, god3 <lb/>

            For example, Victory flies with golden pinions; and, by Jove, <lb/>
            Cupid4 too. And Homer asserted that Iris was like to a <lb/>

              origin of gods and rivers, of Erebus and Chaos, you may <lb/>
              henceforth bid Prodicusl from me2 go weep, when you know <lb/>
              them accurately.</p>
          <p>At first Chaos was, and Night, and dark Erebus, and wide <lb/>
            Tartarus; nor was there earth, or air, or heaven ; but first of <lb/>
            all black-winged Night lays a wind-egg3 in the boundless <lb/>
            bosom of Erebus, from which in revolving time sprang the <lb/>
            much-desired Eros, glittering4 as to his back5 with golden <lb/>
            wings, like to the swift whirlwinds. And he having coha­ <lb/>
            bited with winged nocturnal Chaos in wide Tartarus, hatched <lb/>
            our race, and first led them forth to light. And previously <lb/>
            the race of immortals was not, till Eros commingled all things. <lb/>
            But when the one was commingled with the other, heaven <lb/>
            came into being, and ocean, and earth, and the unperish­ <lb/>
            able race of all the blessed gods. Thus are we by far the <lb/>
            most ancient of all gods. Now that we are children of <lb/>
            Eros is clear by many proofs; for we fly, and are present <lb/>
            with lovers.6 And lovers7 have through our influence pre­ <lb/>

            amongst men, and how many lovers of this country you have. <lb/>

            like Socrates, carried scytales ;1 but now, on the other hand, <lb/>
            having turned about, they are bird-mad, and through pleasure, <lb/>
            do every thing that birds do, imitating them exactly. In the <lb/>
            first place, all of them in the morning used immediately to fly <lb/>

            they used to light upon the leaves3 together; and then they <lb/>
            used there to feed upon their decrees. And so manifestly <lb/>
            were they bird-mad, that even the names of birds were im­ <lb/>
            posed4 upon many. A5 lame huckster was called Partridge; <lb/>

            horn in wedlock ; but if there should not be children born in <lb/>

          <p>PISTH. Therefore he says he gives her up to the swallows.</p>
