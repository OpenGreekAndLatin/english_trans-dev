            <title type="main">PREFACE TO THE TRILOGY.</title>
          </head>
          <p>IT has been truly remarked by Shelley, “ that the jury <lb/>
            which sits in judgment upon a poet must be composed <lb/>
            of his peers; it must be empanelled by time from the <lb/>
            selectest of the wise of many generations." By the <lb/>
            verdict of this august tribunal, Æschylus takes rank <lb/>
            with Homer, Dante, and Shakespeare, and may -justly <lb/>
            be regarded as one of " the unacknowledged legislators <lb/>
            of the world."</p>
          <p>As it may appear presumptuous to offer to the public <lb/>
            a new translation of the Æschylean trilogy, the <lb/>
            grandest dramatic work of classical antiquity, I may <lb/>
            perhaps be allowed to state that I have not entered <lb/>
            upon the task altogether uninvited. On the publica­ <lb/>
            tion of my translation of " Faust," and the other master- <lb/>
            works of Goethe, in Bohn's Standard Library, I was <lb/>
            strongly urged by the late Baron Bunsen to undertake <lb/>
            the translation of the Greek dramas. I felt honoured <lb/>
            by the proposal; and though I was not immediately <lb/>
            impelled to act upon the suggestion, his words have <lb/>
            dwelt in my memory, and have encouraged me to com­ <lb/>
            plete an arduous and very difficult undertaking.</p>
          <p>Considerable diversity of opinion prevails respecting <lb/>
            the propriety of employing rhymed metres as sub­ <lb/>
             <pb n="viii"/>
            stitutes for the complex forms of classical poetry; <lb/>
            henco it may not be inexpedient briefly to state my <lb/>
            reasons for adopting them, as affording in my judgment <lb/>
            the only adequate vehicle for reproducing the choral <lb/>
            odes of the Greek dramas.</p>
          <p>With regard to the principles which should guide <lb/>
            the translator in the execution of his task, it is, I <lb/>
            believe, universally recognized that a translation ought, <lb/>
            as faithfully as possible, to reflect the original, both in <lb/>
            spirit and in form, and that any wilful or unacknow­ <lb/>
            ledged deviation from it is tantamount to a breach of <lb/>
            trust. The difficulty of rigidly applying these prin­ <lb/>
            ciples to the translation of tho choral odes will bo <lb/>
            apparent when we remember that the medium through <lb/>
            which the thought of the ancient poet has to be re­ <lb/>
            embodied differs so essentially from that of the original <lb/>
            as to render the principle of imitation, with reference <lb/>
            to their musical intonations, inapplicable. The futility <lb/>
            of attempting to imitate the forms of classical poetry <lb/>
            in a language the metres of which arc governed not by <lb/>
            Time, but by Accent, has been pointed out by <lb/>
            Professor Newman, in tho preface to his admirable <lb/>
            translation of the Iliad, tho excellence of which can <lb/>
            only be fully appreciated by a careful comparison with <lb/>
            the original.</p>
          <p>An accented metre," he says, "in a language <lb/>
            loaded with consonants cannot bavo the samo sort of <lb/>
            sounding beauty as a quantitative metro in a highly <lb/>
            vocalized language. It is not audible sameness of <lb/>
            metre, but a likeness of moral genius which is to bo <lb/>
             <pb n="ix"/>
            aimed at." The translator, having thus no authorita­ <lb/>
            tive models to necessitate the adoption of particular <lb/>
            forms, is at liberty, without incurring the charge of <lb/>
            unfaithfulness, to adopt those metres, rhymed or <lb/>
            unrhymed, which approve themselves to his judgment <lb/>
            as most in harmony with the spirit of the original. <lb/>
            In order to fulfil this condition, however, he must take <lb/>
            into consideration the highly lyrical character of the <lb/>
            choral odes, which associated themselves not only with <lb/>
            music, but also with the choral dance.</p>
          <p>Now, this lyrical element of ancient poetry, not <lb/>
            admitting of translation, requires to be born anew, and <lb/>
            for this purpose we have a most felicitous adjunct in <lb/>
            rhyme, which, when judiciously employed, may be <lb/>
            regarded as a musical accompaniment, pervading the <lb/>
            choral harmonies, enhancing their beauty, and at the <lb/>
            same time serving to mark the time.</p>
          <p>The only possible objection to the use of an ornament <lb/>
            so attractive and significant, and at the same time so <lb/>
            conformable to the English language, is the notion, <lb/>
            very generally entertained, that " the exigencies of <lb/>
            rhyme forbid faithfulness." Holding fidelity to the <lb/>
            spirit of the original to be the cardinal virtue of a <lb/>
            translator, I should, if this opinion were well founded, <lb/>
            abandon rhyme without hesitation. It appears to me, <lb/>
            however, that the objection is overstated, and that it is <lb/>
            better to aim at the true lyrical ideal, however difficult <lb/>
            of realization. The solution of the problem can only <lb/>
            be worked out by experience. How far I have <lb/>
            succeeded in combining scrupulous fidelity to the <lb/>
             <pb n="x"/>
            original with the employment of rhyme, it is not for <lb/>
            me to judge; metrical translation must always be a <lb/>
            matter of compromise, and no one can be so sensitively <lb/>
            awaro of the shortcomings of a translation as the <lb/>
            translator.</p>
          <p>My desire to bespeak for the dramas of AEschylus <lb/>
            that intelligent study which is essential for their true <lb/>
            appreciation has induced me to attempt in my intro­ <lb/>
            duction a very slight sketch of the progress of religious <lb/>
            thought, as manifested through a few of the great <lb/>
            master-works of literature and art. Poets are repre­ <lb/>
            sentative men; and poetry, under its higher aspects, <lb/>
            may justly be regarded as the fairest flower of the age <lb/>
            and country which gave it birth, drawing its nourish­ <lb/>
            ment from the deepest roots of national life, and con­ <lb/>
            cealing beneath its delicate petals the germs of the <lb/>
            future. Hence every great poem requires for its <lb/>
            elucidation, not only to be studied in connection with <lb/>
            contemporaneous history, but also to be brought into <lb/>
            comparison with tho kindred productions of other <lb/>
            ages and nations. New insight is thus gained into <lb/>
            the developments of history, and tho tendencies of <lb/>
            modern thought arc more clearly interpreted when <lb/>
            brought faco to face with the conceptions and aspira­ <lb/>
            tions of tho old pagan world. If a complete history <lb/>
            of religious development were to bo given, it would of <lb/>
            course to necessary to go back to the prior Monotheism <lb/>
            which probably preceded tho earliest l'antheistic nature- <lb/>
            worship of which wo lavo any record, and also to <lb/>
            investigate tho links of transition from tho Vedic <lb/>
             <pb n="xi"/>
            Divinities to the ideal Personalities of Olympus. Such <lb/>
            an inquiry would, however, exceed the scope of an <lb/>
            introduction.</p>
          <p>In considering the Zeus of Æschylus I have con­ <lb/>
            fined myself almost entirely to the conception of the <lb/>
            Olympian king embodied in the Oresteia, leaving <lb/>
            untouched the apparent discrepancy between the <lb/>
            character there portrayed and that depicted in the <lb/>
            Prometheus Bound. I agree with those critics who <lb/>
            believe that the discrepancy is only apparent, and <lb/>
            would vanish had we the opportunity of studying the <lb/>
            other members of the Promethean trilogy. Critics <lb/>
            are agreed that the Suppliants ought also to be <lb/>
            regarded as a member of a trilogy, in association with <lb/>
            the lost dramas of the Ægyptii and the DanaYdes. <lb/>
            These fragmentary works can, I believe, be only <lb/>
            satisfactorily interpreted when studied in connection <lb/>
            with the Oresteia. The investigation would, however, <lb/>
            necessitate a reference to the remaining dramas of <lb/>
            Æschylus, and must therefore be postponed to a future <lb/>
            opportunity.</p>
          <p>All true lovers of Art, who recognize her legitimate <lb/>
            function as a revealer of truth, a mediator between the <lb/>
            Finite and the Infinite, cannot fail to regret the sub­ <lb/>
            ordinate position to which she is condemned in the pre­ <lb/>
            sent day, when she is too often regarded in the light of <lb/>
            a mere elegant superfluity, as one of the costly adjuncts <lb/>
            of our modern civilization. The true dignity of art <lb/>
            has been nobly vindicated by Hegel in his celebrated <lb/>
            work, entitled " Vorlesungen über die Aesthetik." As <lb/>
             <pb n="xii"/>
            this work is, I believe, comparatively little known in <lb/>
            England, I have ventured to recast, with some modifi­ <lb/>
            cations, a few of his leading ideas, and to embody <lb/>
            them in my introduction. I refer more especially to <lb/>
            his analysis of the Greek dramas, and to his exposition <lb/>
            of the fundamental ideas which characterize the three <lb/>
            great eras-the symbolical, classical, and romantic- <lb/>
            which mark alike the history of religion and of art. I <lb/>
            have also availed myself of C. 0. Muller's admirable <lb/>
            dissertations on "the Eumenides," together with Pro­ <lb/>
            fessor Max Müller's lectures on language, second <lb/>
            series, and his history of ancient Sanscrit literature. <lb/>
            With regard to mythological lore, I am chiefly in­ <lb/>
            debted to Weleker's " Gricchische Götterlehre," Kuhn's <lb/>
            "Hcrabkunft des Feuers," and also to Guigniant's <lb/>
            " Religions do l'Antiquité," translated from the German <lb/>
            of Crcuzer.</p>

            <title type="main">PREFACE TO THE FOUR PLAYS.</title>
          </head>
          <p>THE kind reception accorded to my version of the <lb/>
            Oresteian trilogy has encouraged me to complete my <lb/>
            task by translating the remaining dramas of the great <lb/>
            Athenian bard.</p>
          <p>It is impossible to determine with accuracy the <lb/>
            original number of the Æschylean dramas; the lowest <lb/>
            estimate is seventy-five, the highest one hundred. Of <lb/>
            this treasure of poetry seven dramas only, together <lb/>
            with a few isolated fragments, have escaped the wreck <lb/>
            of time. Æschylus has been compared, not inaptly, to <lb/>
            the Sphinx of the Egyptian desert, buried up to its <lb/>
            shoulders beneath the accumulated sands of ages. <lb/>
            " Enseveli et éternel, le front sortant du sépulere, <lb/>
            Eschyle regarde les générations."</p>
          <p>The influence of his genius has been far-reaching in <lb/>
            space, as well as enduring in time :-it is interesting <lb/>
            to consider the vast area over which the spirit and <lb/>
            language of Hellas were diffused by means of her <lb/>
            colonies, which were found scattered and isolated in <lb/>
            every region of the known world ; from Spain in the <lb/>
            west to the countries bordering upon the Euxine in <lb/>
            the east; from Pannonia in the north to Libya in the <lb/>
            south.</p><pb n="xiv"/>
            
          <p>The importance of poetry as one of the great civiliz­ <lb/>
            ing forces of humanity was not overlooked by these <lb/>
            Hellenic communities. They recognized the prime <lb/>
            truth that " the mind of a nation constitutes its firmest <lb/>
            bulwark." Theatres accordingly were erected beside <lb/>
            their citadels. These edifices, it must be remembered, <lb/>
            were not, as with us, mere places of amusement. <lb/>
            Owing to the religious clement, which from its cradle <lb/>
            pervaded the Athenian drama, the Hellenic theatres <lb/>
            were invested with somewhat of a sacred character, and <lb/>
            their dramatic performances constituted a characteristic <lb/>
            feature of the national life. Æschylus, we are told, <lb/>
            was the favourite poet of the Hellenic colonists.</p>
          <p>"Æschylus present, Hellas was not altogether absent. <lb/>
            His colossal genius thus protected these infant com­ <lb/>
            munities from the inroads of surrounding barbarism, <lb/>
            and maintained them in the circle of Hellenic <lb/>
            civilization."</p>
          <p>It would be well if the civilizing agency of poetry <lb/>
            were more universally recognized. The human mind <lb/>
            requires to be lifted occasionally above the level of <lb/>
            ordinary life, where it is exposed to the perpetual <lb/>
            harass of material cares. Poetry, the highest embodi­ <lb/>
            ment of idealized passion and imaginative thought, <lb/>
            must ever be regarded as a mighty agent for the <lb/>
            accomplishment of this object. Poets of tho highest <lb/>
            order belong, however, not to one ago or country, but <lb/>
            to humanity. It is thereforo important that the <lb/>
            productions of these master-spirits should be adequately <lb/>
            translated and thus rendered generally accessible. <lb/>
             <pb n="xv"/>
            This is more especially true at the present time, when, <lb/>
            with the spread of education, the multitude of readers <lb/>
            will be indefinitely increased.</p>
          <p>.Shakespeare has been not inappropriately styled " the <lb/>
            modern Æschylus;" an association which, to the <lb/>
            English reader at least, invests with peculiar interest <lb/>
            the prophetic poet of the ancient world. The perusal <lb/>
            of his master-works, like those of his great compeer, <lb/>
            illustrates the truth proclaimed by the Apostle from <lb/>
            the Athenian Areopagus, " that God has made of one <lb/>
            blood all nations of men not with standing the diver­ <lb/>
            sity of external surrounding, we discern, in the per­ <lb/>
            sonages of the Æschylean dramas, whether human or <lb/>
            superhuman, beings of like passions with ourselves, <lb/>
            endowed with the same mental constitution, and subject <lb/>
            to the moral laws impressed by the Creator upon our <lb/>
            common humanity. In his sublimer passages we soar <lb/>
            with the poet as on eagle's wings, and anon we come <lb/>
            upon pregnant utterances which <lb/>
            " — fix. themselves <lb/>
            Deep in the heart as meteor stones in earth <lb/>
            Dropped from some higher sphere." <lb/>
            " Who can mistake great thoughts? <lb/>
            They seize upon the mind,-arrest and search <lb/>
            And shake it; bow the tall soul as by wind,- <lb/>
            Rush over it like rivers over reeds, <lb/>
            Which quaver in the current."</p>
          <p>Such are the thoughts of Æschylus I</p>
          <p>From all this wealth of poetry many readers are, <lb/>
            however, practically excluded, not only by the foreign <lb/>
             <pb n="xvi"/>
            language in which it is embodied, but also by their <lb/>
            unfamiliarity with the mythological lore of Hellas. <lb/>
            Like travellers in a foreign country, they shrink from <lb/>
            the exertion of exploring an unknown region without <lb/>
            the assistance of a guide. In order in some measure <lb/>
            to supply this want, I have prefixed to each drama a <lb/>
            brief introduction, setting forth the main incidents of <lb/>
            the situation, together with other explanatory details. <lb/>
            In these introductions I make no claim to originality; <lb/>
            I have consulted the various works, bearing upon the <lb/>
            subject, to which I had access, and from them I have <lb/>
            endeavoured to bring together, as concisely as possible, <lb/>
            such materials as seemed subservient to tho object <lb/>
            which I had in view.</p>
          <p>With regard to Prometheus, I have felt the im­ <lb/>
            possibility of treating adequately, within the narrow <lb/>
            limits of an introduction, a subject so vast, and with <lb/>
            reference to which such diverse opinions arc enter­ <lb/>
            tained. The theory propounded by Schoemann appears <lb/>
            to me to be ono of the most successful attempts to <lb/>
            reconcile the apparent discrepancy between the cha­ <lb/>
            meter of Zeus as portrayed in tho Prometheus Bound, <lb/>
            and that depicted in the remaining dramas of Æschylus, <lb/>
            moro especially in tho Suppliants and the Oresteian <lb/>
            trilogy. I havo accordingly given, in my introduction, <lb/>
            a brief epitomo of somo leading ideas embodied in <lb/>
            Schoemann's essay, and to that I must refer tho reader <lb/>
            for a moro complete exposition of his views.</p>
          <p>In tho introduction to my translation of tho Ores­ <lb/>
            toian trilogy, I have alluded at somo length to the <lb/>
             <pb n="xvii"/>
            theory which refers the origin of the Hellenic mytho­ <lb/>
            logy to the phenomena of the natural world; and which, <lb/>
            through the researches of Prof. Max Muller and other <lb/>
            mythologists, is shown to rest upon a basis of fact. <lb/>
            The application of the theory to the legendary lore of <lb/>
            Hellas has given rise to so. much controversy, and has <lb/>
            opened so wide a field of speculation, that I have <lb/>
            abstained from entering upon the subject, and must <lb/>
            refer the reader to the Rev. G. W. Cox's Mythology <lb/>
            of the Aryan Nations,' where it is fully discussed.</p>
          <p>Having in the choral odes of my second volume <lb/>
            observed the arrangement of Strophe and Antistrophe, <lb/>
            which forms a characteristic feature of the original, I <lb/>
            have thought it advisable to bring my version of the <lb/>
            Oresteian trilogy, in this respect, into harmony with <lb/>
            tho remaining dramas of Æschylus, and have moreover <lb/>
            carefully revised the whole.</p>
          <p>In conclusion, I have great pleasure in expressing <lb/>
            my grateful aeknowledgmentsto my friend Professor <lb/>
            Newman, for his most kind and valuable assistance. <lb/>
            This assistance has reference not merely to the inter­ <lb/>
            pretation of the more obscure passages of the original, <lb/>
            the difficulty of which is greatly enhanced by the <lb/>
            corrupt condition of the text, but also to his proposed <lb/>
            corrections, for which I refer the reader to the notes <lb/>
            printed, as in the Trilogy, at the end of each drama. <lb/>
            I have in addition to thank him for important aid <lb/>
            in rendering the original into English. The whole <lb/>
            of my translation has been submitted to his revision, <lb/>
            and, with his permission, I have freely availed myself <note type="footnote"> b </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="xviii"/>
            of the numerous proposed emendations with which ho <lb/>
            has from time to time most kindly favoured me.</p>
          <p>I am also indebted to my friend Mr. W. W. Lloyd <lb/>
            for several valuable suggestions, for which I beg to <lb/>
            express my cordial thanks. I moreover gladly <lb/>
            acknowledge my obligation to previous commentators <lb/>
            and translators.</p>
          <p>In the preparation of my introductions I have <lb/>
            consulted the following works, from which, for the <lb/>
            most part, I have borrowed my materials. Grote's <lb/>
            ' History of Greece;' Bunsen's ' Gott in der Geschichte <lb/>
            ' Ariadue,' von 0. F. Gruppe; ' Die Aeschylischo <lb/>
            Trilogie Prometheus,' etc., von F. G. Welcker; 'Des <lb/>
            Aeschylos gefesselter Prometheus,' von G. F. Schoemann; <lb/>
            ' Des Aeschylos Werke,' übersetzt von J. G. Droysen; <lb/>
            Hegel's ' Vorlesungen uber die Aesthetik.' I am also <lb/>
            indebted to an interesting essay on the religion of <lb/>
            Æschylus, by Brook F. Westcott, which appeared in the <lb/>
            ' Contemporary Review.' In the preface to my second <lb/>
            volume I have borrowed some thoughts from Victor <lb/>
            Hugo's I Shakespeare.</p>
          <p>I am happy to state that in a separate volume my <lb/>
            translation of the Æschylean dramas is asssociated <lb/>
            with Flaxman's illustrations.</p>

            <title type="main">INTRODUCTION TO THE TRILOGY.</title>
          </head>
          <p>IN order to appreciate the poetry of antiquity, it is <lb/>
            necessary to take into consideration the religious <lb/>
            ideas which lie at its root, which also in the course <lb/>
            of their development have determined the character <lb/>
            alike of ancient literature and art; when we consider, <lb/>
            moreover, the immense influence which the stream of <lb/>
            Aryan thought, by its interfusion with Christianity, <lb/>
            has exerted over the culture of the Western world, a <lb/>
            new and twofold interest attaches to each of the great <lb/>
            master-works of classical antiquity, as exhibiting not <lb/>
            only the level which the religious thought of the age <lb/>
            had already reached, but also as indicating the direc­ <lb/>
            tion of its future development.</p>
          <p>Accordingly, in offering to the public a new version <lb/>
            of the Oresteia, the only complete trilogy which has <lb/>
            escaped the wreck of time, it may not be altogether <lb/>
            irrelevant if I endeavour to determine the position of <lb/>
            Æsehylus among those kindlers of the beacon-fire, <lb/>
            through whose agency the light of ancient wisdom <lb/>
            was transmitted from age to age before the advent of <lb/>
            Christianity.</p>
          <p>With this view it will be necessary to give a sketch <lb/>
             <pb n="xx"/>
            (necessarily very meagre and imperfect) of the progress <lb/>
            of religious thought, both before and after his appear­ <lb/>
            ance on the stage of history, and as art has its root in <lb/>
            the religious nature of man, we shall thus obtain a key <lb/>
            to tho three great epochs which mark the artistic <lb/>
            development of humanity, which havo been charac­ <lb/>
            terized as the Symbolical, the Classical, and tho <lb/>
            Romantic eras.</p>
          <p>When the rays of tradition first dawn upon our <lb/>
            planet, we discover tho primeval ancestors of tho <lb/>
            Aryan race, before their dispersion from their common <lb/>
            home, still gazing with awe and wonder upon tho <lb/>
            working of the vast nature-powers by which they were <lb/>
            environed. While led through tho religious instincts <lb/>
            implanted in human nature to recognize tho existence <lb/>
            of a Being or Eeings who hear and answer prayer, <lb/>
            they wero unable to separate tho idea of mind, as a <lb/>
            causal power, from the aspects of external nature. <lb/>
            Accordingly, tho shadowy divinities of tho Vedic <lb/>
            Pantheon, Indra, Agni, Varuna, can hardly be regarded <lb/>
            as distinct personalities, holding definito relations to <lb/>
            each other, or to their worshippers. As in tho fluctu­ <lb/>
            ating scenery of the diurnal drama the sun is obscured <lb/>
            by clouds, which in their turn arc scattered and anon <lb/>
            collected again, so these deified impersonations of <lb/>
            physical phenomena loom dimly before our mental <lb/>
            vision, each supreme and absolute in turn; nor is it <lb/>
            easy to determine whether behind theso Innumerable <lb/>
            divinities, tho conception of One infinite Spirit had yet <lb/>
            dawnedupon the Aryan mind.</p><pb n="xxi"/>
            
          <p>The deities of the Vedas vanish from our gaze, lost <lb/>
            " In the deep backward and abysm of time."</p>
          <p>After the lapse of ages they reappear upon the stage,. <lb/>
            so modified, however, that it is difficult to recognize <lb/>
            their identity: on the southern side of the Himalayahs <lb/>
            they assume the form of the great Brahminical trinity, <lb/>
            Vishnu, Brahma, and Siva, emerging from a back­ <lb/>
            ground of Pantheism; while in Greece we behold <lb/>
            them metamorphosed into the hierarchy of the <lb/>
            Olympian gods. So striking is the contrast between <lb/>
            the deities apostrophized by the Vedic bards, and the <lb/>
            grand impersonations of Grecian poetry and art, that <lb/>
            without conclusive evidence the connection between <lb/>
            them could hardly be recognized. This evidence is <lb/>
            twofold ;-in the first place, comparative philology <lb/>
            reveals the fact that the sacred names of the Greek <lb/>
            Pantheon are in the Vedas intelligible words, expres­ <lb/>
            sive of natural phenomena ; while in the Iliad we are <lb/>
            introduced to the Olympian deities during the process <lb/>
            of transformation; we detect their forms gradually dis­ <lb/>
            engaging themselves from the physical phenomena with <lb/>
            which they were associated, of which also they may be <lb/>
            regarded as the spiritual but almost impalpable essence.</p>
          <p>This transformation of physical into humanized <lb/>
            deities has been compared by Welclier to the myste­ <lb/>
            rious process by which the chrysalis passes into its <lb/>
            more perfect form. " The Nature-god," he says, <lb/>
            " became enveloped in a web of mythical fable, and <lb/>
            emerged as a divine, humanized personality." For <lb/>
             <pb n="xxii"/>
            the principle which lies at the root of this meta­ <lb/>
            morphosis, he points to the gradual development of <lb/>
            human nature, to the growing consciousness of free­ <lb/>
            will, accompanied by the recognition of mind as a <lb/>
            higher manifestation of deity than any material pheno­ <lb/>
            mena, and consequently of man as the true Shekinah.</p>
          <p>As, however, in the earlier Vedic worship men were <lb/>
            unable to separate the idea of mind, as a causal <lb/>
            power, from tho varied aspects of external nature, so, <lb/>
            when they began to direct their thoughts within, they <lb/>
            were equally embarrassed to distinguish between tho <lb/>
            divine and human elements in the soul of man. Every <lb/>
            inward movement which appeared at all exceptional was <lb/>
            ascribed to the prompting of a deity; not only were <lb/>
            tho nobler emotions of courage and self-restraint <lb/>
            referred to divine inspiration (of which in the Iliad wo <lb/>
            find innumerable examples), but tho gods are also <lb/>
            represented as the authors of delusion (ii. 8, xxii. 24) <lb/>
            and treachery (iv. 93), as when Zeus sends tho <lb/>
            deceitful dream to Agamemnon, and Athena prompts <lb/>
            Pandarus to violate tho treaty. One of the most <lb/>
            noteworthy instances to this perplexity is found in <lb/>
            Agamemnon's exculpation of himself touching tho <lb/>
            outrage upon Achilles (xix. 85) : <lb/>
            "I am not guilty, Jove and Fate | and the dusk-roaming <lb/>
            Fury­ <lb/>
            'Tis these who in assembly fir'd | my breast with savage <lb/>
            frenzy." * <note type="footnote"> * I have availetl myself here and in subsequent quotations <lb/>
            of Professor Newman's translation. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="xxiii"/>
            A plea, the justice of which is admitted by Achilles, <lb/>
            who echoes the sentiment of Agamemnon : <lb/>
            "0 Father Jove, great frenesies I to men thou truly sendest." <lb/>
            Moreover, on the first transference of human passion <lb/>
            and emotion, together with the conditions of human <lb/>
            existence, to the super-mundane sphere, the very con­ <lb/>
            ception of divine existence, as absolved from restraint, <lb/>
            would lead to the deification of human infirmity to­ <lb/>
            gether with the higher attributes of humanity : of this <lb/>
            we have a memorable example in the character of the <lb/>
            Homeric Zeus. This tendency would doubtless be <lb/>
            accelerated by the phenomena expounded by Prof. Max <lb/>
            Muller, in his " Lectures on Language." As the several <lb/>
            branches of the Aryan stock dispersed, migrating from <lb/>
            their common home in Central Asia, the original <lb/>
            signification of words was forgotten or obscured; and <lb/>
            thus, language originally descriptive of natural pheno­ <lb/>
            mena became transferred to the conditions of human <lb/>
            life-a translation which totally metamorphosed the <lb/>
            character of the occurrence.</p>
          <p>The transference of human faith and worship from <lb/>
            the vague nature-powers of the Vedas to the humanized <lb/>
            deities of Olympus, together with the association of <lb/>
            the latter into a celestial hierarchy, under the supre­ <lb/>
            macy of Zeus, assumed in Grecian mythology the form <lb/>
            of a revolution, and was symbolized under the grand <lb/>
            old allegory of the battle between the Titans and the <lb/>
            Olympian gods. This revolution, involving a variety <lb/>
            of complex phenomena, especially the fusion of the <lb/>
             <pb n="xxiv"/>
            mythology of different tribes or nations into one, was <lb/>
            doubtless accomplished in its main features in tho ages <lb/>
            anterior to Homer.</p>
          <p>However, as we have no Grecian literature to illus­ <lb/>
            trate this period, we are unable to trace the history of tho <lb/>
            transition, nor can we determine how far the current <lb/>
            mythology of his age was modified by the individual <lb/>
            genius of the great epic bard, whoso immortal work, <lb/>
            while inaugurating a new epoch in the history of <lb/>
            civilization, at tho same time exhibits, as has been <lb/>
            truly said, the last lingering traces of the primeval <lb/>
            age. A superficial acquaintance with the Iliad suffices <lb/>
            to reveal the original elemental character of the <lb/>
            Homeric divinities, a fact which would bo more <lb/>
            generally recognized, were we not accustomed to carry <lb/>
            to the perusal of the earlier poet the conceptions <lb/>
            derived from the artistic impersonations of a later age. <lb/>
            This transitional character of the Homeric mythology <lb/>
            will be more apparent if wo carry back to their original <lb/>
            root in natural phenomena a few of tho Olympian <lb/>
            divinities, and then follow tho process of their develop­ <lb/>
            ment, as they appear successively in the Iliad and in <lb/>
            the Orosteia. The connection between Jupiter and tho <lb/>
            sky, familiar to Greek and Latin scholars, may bo <lb/>
            traced down to tho latest period of classical poetry; <lb/>
            so Horaco—" Manct sub Jovo frigido venator." It <lb/>
            was reserved, however, for tho science of comparative <lb/>
            philology to point out tho origin of this connection. <lb/>
            Thus wo learn that " Zeus, tho most sacred name in <lb/>
            Greek mythology is tho same word as Dyaus in <lb/>
             <pb n="xxv"/>
            Sanscrit, which means the sky; and that originally <lb/>
            Dyu was the bright heavenly deity in India, as well as <lb/>
            in Greece."</p>
          <p>It is remarked by Welcker, that " the greatest fact, <lb/>
            when we go back to the highest Grecian antiquity, is the <lb/>
            idea of God, as the Supreme Being, associated with a <lb/>
            nature-worship, never entirely suppressed, together with <lb/>
            the conception of a divine family derived from Zeus."</p>
          <p>Accordingly, we recognize in the Homeric Zeus <lb/>
            three distinct elements, the divine, the physical, and <lb/>
            the human, welded together into an artificial unity, and <lb/>
            exhibiting a character of marvellous incongruity, en­ <lb/>
            dowed with attributes the most inconsistent and con­ <lb/>
            tradictory. Thus, in not a few passages, he is re­ <lb/>
            presented as the supreme deity­</p>
          <p>" Who reigneth mighty over all, both mortals and <lb/>
            immortals." (II. xii. 242.) " Whose decree, once <lb/>
            sanctioned by the nod, is neither deceptive, nor re­ <lb/>
            vokable." (II. i. 527.) " The Counsellor, greatest and <lb/>
            best; Father of gods and men; the Guardian of the <lb/>
            oath." (iv. 235.) "The Vindicator of righteous law." <lb/>
            (xxi. 337.) The High Arbiter of war." (xix. 224.) His <lb/>
            superiority over the other gods is forcibly brought <lb/>
            out in the beginning of the 8th book (18—27,) where the <lb/>
            other dwellers in Olympus are invited to grasp the <lb/>
            golden chain dropped from Heaven's heights, and held <lb/>
            immovably in the hand of Zeus : <lb/>
            " Lay hold, and throw your force on it, all gods both male <lb/>
            and female, <lb/>
             <pb n="xxvi"/>
            Yet never shall ye. down to earth, drag from the lofty <lb/>
            heaven <lb/>
            Zeus the supreme deviser."*</p>
          <p>It is as the god of compassion that the diviner <lb/>
            aspect of his character is the most conspicuous <lb/>
            (ix. 502): when we consider the savagery of an age in <lb/>
            which human victims were sacrificed to appease the <lb/>
            'Manes of the dead, and where tendencies to cannibalism <lb/>
            may perhaps be detected (iv. 35), (xxii. 345), (xxiv. <lb/>
            212), the prominence given to compassion as an attri­ <lb/>
            bute of the supreme Deity is very remarkable.</p>
          <p>Notwithstanding these high attributes, no exercise of <lb/>
            providential power is ever assigned to the Homeric <lb/>
            Zeus; ho is beguiled by Hera, yet swayed by her <lb/>
            counsel (xvi. 460), and though desirous to save Ilium, <lb/>
            yet, at her entreaty, ho surrenders it to destruction <lb/>
            (iv. 43). Like the heavens, now bright with sunshine, <lb/>
            and anon dark with storm, he exhibits all the capricious <lb/>
            fluctuations of an elemental power, being alternately <lb/>
            malignant and benign, without any apparent motive <lb/>
            beyond his own caprice, uninfluenced by moral con­ <lb/>
            siderations. Then, again, with regard to his supre­ <lb/>
            macy, not only is it questioned by Poseidon (xv. 1S5), <lb/>
            it is actually imperilled by that deity, in conjunction <lb/>
            with Hera aud Athena (i. 306—100), and is only <lb/>
            rescued from their machinations by the intervention of <lb/>
            Driarcus. <note type="footnote"> * Crenzer has pointed out the same image in a passage <lb/>
            of the Bhagavat-gita. </note></p><pb n="xxvii"/>
            
          <p>These legends probably symbolize convulsions of the <lb/>
            elements, which threaten to blot out the sky, of which <lb/>
            Zeus is the impersonation. In this character, as <lb/>
            an elemental god, he is not only the father of <lb/>
            rivers, he also presides over all meteorological pheno­ <lb/>
            mena.</p>
          <p>Thus with his AEgis, the dark storm-cloud, he veils <lb/>
            the summit of Mount Ida (xvii. 593), and even ocean <lb/>
            shudders at his dreadful bolt. He rains (xii. 5). He <lb/>
            snows (xii. 280). He deviseth hail and piercing sleet, <lb/>
            and rainy flood (x. 5). He uproots the sturdy oak <lb/>
            (xiv. 415), and he snaps the bow-string of Teucer (xv. <lb/>
            469). Occasionally the moral and physical elements <lb/>
            are most curiously blended, as in the elaborate descrip­ <lb/>
            tion of the rain deluge with which he punishes the <lb/>
            crooked verdict of the unjust judge (xvi. 385). Many <lb/>
            other passages of a similar character might be cited.</p>
          <p>But it is in his relation with Hera, and the various <lb/>
            heroines who are represented as the objects of his love, <lb/>
            that the human element in the conception of the <lb/>
            Homeric Zeus appears under its most revolting aspect.</p>
          <p>His character has accordingly been described as the <lb/>
            most repulsive in the whole circle of Olympian life, <lb/>
            exhibiting the very temper of the most advanced <lb/>
            depravity.* “ It is the Jupiter of Homer in whom <lb/>
            we see first the most complete surrender of personal <lb/>
            morality and self-government to mere appetite, and the <lb/>
            most thoroughly selfish groundwork of character. <note type="footnote"> * Gladstone's Homer. </note> <lb/>

          <p>We seem to inhale a purer atmosphere when, by the <lb/>
            aid of comparative philology, we are enabled to trans­ <lb/>
            late back into natural phenomena occurrences which, <lb/>
            when transferred to the sphere of human life, are <lb/>
            repulsive and revolting. Thus it is not difficult to <lb/>
            recognize the physical idea which underlies the con­ <lb/>
            ception of Hera, whose name-derived, according to <lb/>
            Welckcr, from <foreign xml:lang="grc">ε̌ρα</foreign>,* the earth-sufficiently indicates <lb/>
            the original conception symbolized by her marriage <lb/>
            with Zeus, the sky. Ge, the earth, is invoked in the <lb/>
            Iliad, with Zeus and other divinities (ii. 277; six. <lb/>
            258). Of the three goddesses, Hera, Diono, and <lb/>
            Demeter, in whom the primeval goddess reappears <lb/>
            mythically metamorphosed (who also originally held <lb/>
            tho samo relation to Zeus as seen on ancient coins), <lb/>
            Hera is alone distinguished in tho Hiad as the Queen <lb/>
            of Heaven, whilo Demeter, without Divino significance, <lb/>
            is alluded to in connection with agricultural pursuits <lb/>
            (xiii. 322 ; v. 500), and Dione appears as tho mother <lb/>
            of Aphrodite (v. 370).</p>

            her high position in the Olympian theogony : among <lb/>
            a warlike people, who abandoned agriculture to their <lb/>
            dependants, the physical attributes of the goddess were <lb/>
            gradually obscured, and accordingly we find her in the <lb/>
            Iliad as the peculiar patroness of Achilles, chief of the <lb/>
            battle-loving myrmidons (i. 208; ix. 254). Though <lb/>
            the physical attributes of Hera are almost entirely <lb/>
            suppressed in the Iliad, we trace a curious lingering of <lb/>
            the nature element in the Thcogamia, described with <lb/>
            such luxuriance of imagery in the 14th book (345- <lb/>
            351) : " As the story of the Olympian Father descend­ <lb/>
            ing as golden rain into the prison of Danaï was meant <lb/>
            for the bright sky, delivering earth from the bonds of <lb/>
            winter ; ”so the union of Zeus and Hera, shrouded in <lb/>
            golden mist, doubtless typified the same natural pheno­ <lb/>
            menon, followed as it was by a new outgrowth of <lb/>
            tender herbage, " the lotus, the crocus, and the hya­ <lb/>
            cinth." A similar remnant of natural symbolism <lb/>
            might probably be detected in other Homeric legends, <lb/>
            which in their human aspect are puerile and revolting : <lb/>
            as when the refractory spouse of Zeus hangs suspended <lb/>
            by a golden chain, a pair of anvils attached to her <lb/>
            ankles (xv. 19). How far Homer recognized the <lb/>
            original significance of these legends is an interesting <lb/>
            but still unsettled question.—Müller (Prol. 279).</p>
          <p>If from the thundering, cloud-compelling Zeus of <lb/>
            the Iliad, we turn to the Zeus of the Oresteia, the <lb/>
            contrast is so remarkable, that it would almost appear <lb/>
            as if the great dramatist, by the very emphasis with <lb/>
            which he brings out the providential charact r of the <lb/>
            Supreme Ruler, desired, like his contemporary, Pindar, <lb/>
             <pb n="xxx"/>
            to enter his protest against the unworthy conception <lb/>
            of the Epic bard. This hypothesis seems the more <lb/>
            plausible when we consider that the age of Æsehylus <lb/>
            immediately succeeded that of Pisistratus, who had <lb/>
            given his sanction to the enactments of Solon, " by <lb/>
            which the Hiad was raised into a liturgy, periodically <lb/>
            rehearsed by Jaw at the preatest of the Athenian fes­ <lb/>
            tivals; ” ., exhibiting for the first and last time in-the <lb/>
            history of the world the preservation of a poet's com­ <lb/>
            positions made an object of permanent public policy."</p>
          <p>Accordingly, in the opening chorus of the Agamem­ <lb/>
            non, Zens is represented as conducting in person tho <lb/>
            grand judicial retribution which, in consequence of the <lb/>
            crime of Paris, involves Ilium in ruin. In the second <lb/>
            chorus this providential action of Zeus is brought out <lb/>
            with even stronger emphasis; he is there represented <lb/>
            as having with prescient might foreordained the blow <lb/>
            which fell at length in accomplishment of his decree. <lb/>
            The mighty net of Divine retribution is cast over <lb/>
            the devoted city, and the character of Zeus is vindi­ <lb/>
            cated as the righteous governor of men. So again in <lb/>
            the third chorus, it is Zeus, protector of the guest, who <lb/>
            sends Helen, a fury fraught with destruction, to avenge <lb/>
            on the sons of Priam the violated rights of hospitality ; <lb/>
            and whereas, in the Iliad, there is division in heaven, <lb/>
            the deities, swayed by motives purely personal, and <lb/>
            often of the lowest character (xxiv. 30 ; iv. -18), take <lb/>
            part in the quarrel, and appear arrayed against one. <lb/>
            another in the hostile ranks ;—in tho Orestein, on tho <lb/>
            contrary, they arn represented as leagued with Zeus in <lb/>
            cari ying out the great, euds of justice. Thus, when <lb/>
             <pb n="xxxi"/>
            the cause is brought before the celestial tribunal, <lb/>
            “ without dissentient voice they cast their votes into <lb/>
            the bloody urn, sealing the doom of Troy." (Ag. 789.) <lb/>
            Zeus is not only represented as exercising supreme <lb/>
            authority in the moral government of mankiud­ <lb/>
            “In will, in deed, <lb/>
            Sole cause, sole fashioner" (Ag. 1462); <lb/>
            he also acts inwardly on the souls of men : it is Zeus <lb/>
            whose highest gift is an untainted mind (Ag. 900); <lb/>
            who leads men to wisdom through suffering (Ag. 169); <lb/>
            a function in which he is aided by the subordinate <lb/>
            deities (Ag. 175), who are represented as the exponents <lb/>
            of his will. (Eum. 588.)</p>
          <p>In the Suppliants, together with a curious lingering <lb/>
            of the 'mythological element; we find the grandest <lb/>
            ascriptions of omnipotence to the Olympian king. <lb/>
            Thus, he is invoked as " King of kings, most blessed <lb/>
            of the blest, among the Perfect, Power most perfect, <lb/>
            Zeus, supreme in bliss! " (Sup. 518.) He is charac­ <lb/>
            terized as "Mighty Zeus, Protector of the guest, the <lb/>
            Highest, who directs Destiny by hoary law." (Sup. <lb/>
            655.) "Zeus, Lord of ceaseless time" (Sup. 567), <lb/>
            "almighty Ruler of the earth." (Sup. 795.) He is <lb/>
            likewise apostrophized -as the great Artificer, supreme <lb/>
            Ruler, who knows no superior, whose deed is prompt <lb/>
            as his word to execute the designs of his deep-counsel­ <lb/>
            ling mind. (Sup, 587.) Thus the mythological vesture, <lb/>
            woven of Nature and Humanity, which had well-nigh <lb/>
            shrouded the grander features of the Homeric Zeus, is <lb/>
            partially withdrawn in Æschylus, and we behold a <lb/>
             <pb n="xxxii"/>
            Being whom men could worship without degradation, <lb/>
            till in the fullness of time the light of celestial Truth <lb/>
            burst with clear effulgence on the heathen world.</p>
          <p>We can hardly imagine that the capricious elemental <lb/>
            deity of the Iliad should have been metamorphose <lb/>
            into the venerable deity of the Oresteia by the blow <lb/>
            process of spiritual development alone, without the <lb/>
            action of external agency : if we consider the affinity <lb/>
            between the Hellenic and the Persian races, and the <lb/>
            close contact into which they were brought in Asia <lb/>
            Minor, the modification of Grecian thought by the <lb/>
            interfusion of Persian elements will not appear re­ <lb/>
            markable. In support of this hypothesis, I might <lb/>
            appeal not only to the high spiritual character attri­ <lb/>
            buted to Ahura-Mazda, the Zeus of the Zend-Avesta, <lb/>
            but also to the sharp contrast there exhibited between <lb/>
            the principles of Good and Evil, a feature which <lb/>
            strikingly distinguishes the thcogony of Æschylus <lb/>
            from that of flower.</p>
          <p>The relics of ancient sun-worship which arc dis <lb/>
            covered in various localities of Greece bear witness to <lb/>
            the vast influenco exerted by the celestial luminary <lb/>
            over the imaginations and the religious emotions of the <lb/>
            primeval world, an influence which is also attested by <lb/>
            the numerous divinities in whom the Sun-god reappears, <lb/>
            mythically metamorphosed .Helios, in tho Hiad, is <lb/>
            characterizel as " the Unwenriablo ; " " the Brings of <lb/>
            light like Mithra, who has a thousand ears and ten <lb/>
            thousand eyes,‟He overseeth all, and hearkeneth to <lb/>
            all things " (nii. 277). On the reconcilintion of Aga­ <lb/>
            memnon and Ach hes, a boar is sacrificed to Helios <lb/>
             <pb n="xxxiii"/>
            and to Zeus (xix. 197). The Trojans sacrifice to the <lb/>
            Earth and to Helios, the Achæans to Zens (iii. 104).</p>
          <p>In the opening chorus of the Agamemnon, the ancient <lb/>
            Arcadian Suu-god, Pan,* whose name is not mentioned <lb/>
            in the Iliad, is associated with Zeus and Apollo, as <lb/>
            sending the Fury to punish crime. The original charac­ <lb/>
            ter of this divinity, who with Zeus and Apollo shares <lb/>
            the epithet Lykeios, is betrayed by many significant <lb/>
            symbols, associated with his effigies and his worship. <lb/>
            Among the various impersonations of the Sun, how­ <lb/>
            ever, there is none which can compare in interest and <lb/>
            significance with Dionysos and Apollo, both solar <lb/>
            divinities, whose worship, nevertheless, offers many <lb/>
            remarkable points of opposition and contact.</p>
          <p>The celestial luminary was imagined to sleep during <lb/>
            the winter and to awake to consciousness in spring ; <lb/>
            accordingly Dionysos, rising from the sea at the vernal <lb/>
            equinox to inaugurate the new solar year, was hailed <lb/>
            with transports of joy by his enthusiastic votaries. <lb/>
            The fluctuating character of Dionysos reminds us of <lb/>
            the nature deities of the Vedas; Proteus-like, he <lb/>
            assumes every variety of form and age ; he is the god <lb/>
            of summer and of winter, of darkness and of light; he <lb/>
            holds in his hand the inebriating chalice, together with <lb/>
            the cosmical mirror, exhibiting the images of all things. <lb/>
            His worship is of peculiar interest, from its association <lb/>
            with the Greek drama. Grecian tragedy, as is well <note type="footnote"> * In my revised version I have followed Prof. Newman’s <lb/>
            reading of this passage, which omits the name of " Pan " in <lb/>

            known, was an expansion of the choruses chanted at <lb/>
            the Dionysic festivals, which rehearsed the vicissitudes <lb/>
            of the solar god, in his progress through the heavenly <lb/>
            signs. This circumstance exerted " an overruling effect <lb/>
            upon the quality of the Athenian drama;" ‟ from this <lb/>
            early cradle of tragedy arose a sanctity which compelled <lb/>
            all things to modulate into the same religious key."*</p>
          <p>Peculiar interest moreover attaches to Dionysos, <lb/>
            from his association with the mysteries which exerted <lb/>
            so powerful an influence over the Grecian mind.</p>
          <p>The story of Dionysos, embodying some of the main <lb/>
            features of his worship, appears in the Iliad (vi. 132), <lb/>
            invested, however, with ethical, not religious signifi­ <lb/>
            cance. ‟It is a remarkable circumstance that pre­ <lb/>
            cisely those divinities, Demeter and Dionysos, whose <lb/>
            truly religious influence was most profound and <lb/>
            pervading in Greece, arc all but unmentioned in <lb/>
            Homer, and may be said, in fact, to bo excluded from <lb/>
            his scheme of the divine commnnity.”† An interesting <lb/>
            question arises as to the cause of this omission on the <lb/>
            part of the great epic bard. Are wo to Imagine that <lb/>
            the peculiar sanctity which attached to these divinities <lb/>
            induced him deliberately to avoid the subject; or must <lb/>
            wo conclude that in the Homeric ago their worship <lb/>
            had not yet assumed that mysterious and impressive <lb/>
            character which subsequently distinguished it? I <lb/>
            confess I am unablo to decide the question, but incline <lb/>
            to the Liter hypothesis. <note type="footnote"> * Theory of Greek Tragedy. Do Quincey. </note><note type="footnote"> t Homer, his Art and his Ago. W. Watkiss Lloyo, <lb/>

          <p>The original solar signification of Apollo is main­ <lb/>
            tained among other eminent scholars by Creuzer, <lb/>
            Welcker, and Gerhard, who appeal alike to ancient <lb/>
            monuments and coins, and to vestiges of ancient Sun- <lb/>
            worship found in various localities in Greece. " If we <lb/>

            to reach its ultimate roots, we must explore the ancient <lb/>
            literatures of Persia and India. If from this point of <lb/>

            god and Apollo, we shall find in the figurative language <lb/>
            of the Vedas the primitive occasion of the transition <lb/>
            from the former to the latter."</p>
          <p>One of the most striking features of the ancient Sun- <lb/>
            worship was its dualistic character, founded upon the <lb/>
            twofold aspect of the solar luminary, as at the same <lb/>
            time a beneficent and a destroying power, as conquer­ <lb/>
            ing and conquered, as dying, yet endowed with ever­ <lb/>
            renovated life ; a conception which explains the enigma <lb/>
            said to be uttered by the oracle of Apollo at Glares, in <lb/>
            Ionia, “I am Jupiter Ammon in Spring, and black <lb/>
            Pluto in Winter." In order to understand the more <lb/>
            terrible aspects of the ancient Sun-god, we have only <lb/>
            to remember the annual fevers occasioned by his <lb/>
            scorching rays, and the danger of famine from failure <lb/>
            of the crops : after the lightning of Zeus, there was no <lb/>
            natural agent so destructive as the arrow of Helios ; as <lb/>
            calamity, moreover, was regarded in ancient times as <lb/>
            the expression of Divine anger, expiatory and peniten­ <lb/>
            tial rites formed an essential element of the ancient <lb/>
            Sun-worship. This twofold aspect of Helios finds <lb/>
             <pb n="xxxvi"/>
            expression also in the namo of the latter Sun-god, <lb/>
            Apollo, which, in the ancient Doric Æolian form, was <lb/>
            not ’<foreign xml:lang="grc">Απόλλων</foreign>, the Destroyer, but ’<foreign xml:lang="grc">Απελλων</foreign>, the Averter. <lb/>
            It is under his darker aspect "as the Minister of <lb/>
            Vengeance, and the Chastiser of Arrogance," that he <lb/>
            appears for the most part in the poetry of Homer. <lb/>
            " His punishments arc pestilence and death "Achilles, <lb/>
            to whom he is particularly hostile, calls him the most <lb/>
            pernicious of all the gods."*</p>
          <p>While tho Homeric Apollo, in his relation with <lb/>
            mortals, appears thus in the light of a malevolent <lb/>
            and destroying power, among the Olympians ho <lb/>
            is introduced in association with the Muses, as <lb/>
            the god of Music, charming the assembled deities <lb/>
            with his harp (i. 603). The notion that the stars <lb/>
            and tho other heavenly bodies accomplished their­ <lb/>
            revolutions to the sound of music is expressed in tho <lb/>
            ancient poetry of India, and also in that of the Persians. <lb/>
            As the rhythm of the cosmical movements depended <lb/>
            upon the solar luminary, the great orderer of times and <lb/>
            seasons, it is not surprising that from tho most remote <lb/>
            antiquity the Sun god was represented as playing on <lb/>
            the cithara; in this character ho is portrayed on the <lb/>
            oldest Archaie vases, encireled by tho dancing hours.</p>
          <p>Although in the Oresteia Apollo is introduced inci­ <lb/>
            dentally as a destroying and avenging deity, as in tho <lb/>
            passage already quoted in tho 1st Chorus of tho <lb/>
            Agamemnon, and also where ho is invoked by Cassandra <note type="footnote"> * C. 0. Müller’s History of the Dorians. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="xxxvii"/>
            as her destroyer (1047), he nevertheless wears, for <lb/>
            the most part, a more benignant aspect. He is <lb/>
            emphatically the Healer, the Prophet-leech, who <lb/>
            purifies from all defilement (Eum. 62); the god of joy, <lb/>
            whom it befits not to invoke with words of sorrow <lb/>
            (Ag. 1056): the most striking point of divergence <lb/>
            from the Homeric conception of Apollo is to be found <lb/>
            in his relation to Zeus, with whom he appears in the <lb/>
            most intimate association. As the god of prophecy, <lb/>
            the guardian of the sacred oracles, he declares most <lb/>
            emphatically that he is simply the expounder of his <lb/>
            father's will, and consequently that he cannot lie. <lb/>
            (Eum. 585, 588.) It is under this aspect, as the god <lb/>
            of Truth, that a deep significance attaches to the func­ <lb/>
            tion which he assumes in the court of Areopagus as <lb/>
            Exegetes, or expounder of the unwritten law. ‟ At <lb/>
            Athens, the Exegetæ, who presided over the purification <lb/>
            of blood-guilty persons, were elected, or at least their <lb/>
            election was ratified, by the Delphic Oracle."* In this <lb/>
            character, Apollo appears before the Areopagites, to <lb/>
            expound the law in relation to homicide, and thus the <lb/>
            deep-thoughted poet enforces the important principle <lb/>
            that the judicial proceedings of human tribunals must <lb/>
            be under the presidency of Truth.</p>
          <p>According to Welcker, however, the Moon appears <lb/>
            of all natural objects to have been the most universally <lb/>
            adored. Several tribes in Africa and America are said <lb/>
            at the present day to worship the moon without the <note type="footnote"> * Dissertations on the Eumenides. C. 0. Muller. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="xxxviii"/>
            sun, while no nation has been known to whom the sun <lb/>
            is sacred without the moon. In primeval ages the <lb/>
            computations of time were based upon the changes of <lb/>
            the moon, which accordingly in the Indo-Germanic <lb/>
            languages is known as ‟ The Measurer; " and so deeply <lb/>
            did the lunar phenomena appeal to tho religious <lb/>
            emotions of humanity, that among all early nations, as <lb/>
            well as among the Jews, the new-moon festivals were <lb/>
            celebrated with peculiar solemnity. In warm climates, <lb/>
            moreover, vegetation is nourished almost entirely by <lb/>
            the dew, which falls most copiously when the moon is <lb/>
            full; hence Selene was early characterized as the <lb/>
            mother of Horse, the Bringer of the Dew. It would <lb/>
            be very interesting to trace tho various media of tran­ <lb/>
            sition by which the bright nocturnal luminary was <lb/>
            gradually metamorphosed into the Huntress Diana— <lb/>
            ‟ Fair silver-shafted queen for ever chaste, <lb/>
            Who set at nought the frivolous bolts of Cupid." <lb/>
            So great, however, is tho diversity of form under which <lb/>
            the Moon-goddess has been conceived, exhibiting a <lb/>
            different physiognomy in every different locality, ac­ <lb/>
            cording to tho varied aspect under which sho has been <lb/>
            regarded, that I must content myself with a brief notice <lb/>
            of her characteristics, as sho appears in tho Iliad and <lb/>
            the Orestein.</p>
          <p>To tho goddess of tho green-wood and tho glado <lb/>
            belonged of right all animals both taIo and wild ; <lb/>
            accordingly sho is characterized in tho Iliad as <lb/>
            (<foreign xml:lang="grc">πότνια θηρω̂ν</foreign>), “ Queen of all Venison " (xxi. 470), <lb/>
             <pb n="xxxix"/>
            and in the Agamemnon she is represented as taking <lb/>
            under her especial care­ <lb/>
            " The tender whelps, new-dropped, of creatures rude, <lb/>
            Sparing the udder-loving brood <lb/>
            Of every beast through field or wood that roves,”—(Ag. 139.) <lb/>
            While thus gracious to the lower animals, towards <lb/>
            humanity, on the contrary, she, like the Homeric <lb/>
            Apollo, wears the aspect of a destroying rather than of <lb/>
            a benignant power. Thus she is represented as made <lb/>
            by Zens (<foreign xml:lang="grc">λέοντα γύναιξι</foreign>), ‟ a lion unto women, to <lb/>
            whom he hath granted might to slay whomso she <lb/>
            willeth” (XXI. 484). Accordingly, in her anger sho <lb/>
            slew Laodamia, daughter of Bellerophontes (vi. 205), <lb/>
            and wrathful, on account of her neglected rites, she <lb/>
            sends the savage, white-tusked boar­ <lb/>
            “Who visited with dire annoy I the orchard-grounds of <lb/>
            (Eneus." (ix. 540.)</p>
          <p>Andromache, too, in her address to Hector, alludes <lb/>
            to her mother slain by “ arrow-pouring Artemis." <lb/>
            (vi. 428.)</p>
          <p>In the Agamemnon she appears under the same <lb/>
            dark aspect, as the goddess for whose propitiation <lb/>
            the sacrifice of Iphigenia was consummated, a tragedy <lb/>
            which, by calling down upon her husband the ven­ <lb/>
            geance of Clytemnestra, forms the groundwork of the <lb/>
            drama.</p>
          <p>Far more prominent, however, is the position as­ <lb/>
            signed to the Maiden Goddess, Pallas Athena, who <lb/>
            may be justly regarded as the bright, consummate flower <lb/>
             <pb n="xl"/>
            of Grecian mythology ; and most interesting it is to <lb/>
            trace the history of her growth from her rise in the <lb/>
            land of the Aryans to her culmination in the majestic <lb/>
            goddess of the Eumenides.</p>
          <p>The elemental character of the Homeric Zeus sug­ <lb/>
            gests the Idea of some natural phenomenon underlying <lb/>
            the extraordinary birth of his brilliant offspring, “ from <lb/>
            no mother born." Accordingly her name has been <lb/>
            regarded as corresponding to the Sanscrit Aháná, a <lb/>
            recognised appellation of the dawn in the Veda; and <lb/>
            thus her miraculous birth from the head of Zeus, trans­ <lb/>
            lated back into Sanscrit, implies that Ushas, the Dawn, <lb/>
            sprang from the East, the forehead of the sky.* <lb/>
            Welcker gives a different interpretation of her name. <lb/>
            ‟ The Grecians," he says, ‟ brought with them from <lb/>
            their distant home the conception of an element of <lb/>
            light and warmth above the atmosphere, independent of <lb/>
            the sun." He derives her name from <foreign xml:lang="grc">αιθ</foreign>, to burn, <lb/>
            with the ancient suffix <foreign xml:lang="grc">ηνη</foreign>, and regards her as tho <lb/>
            impersonation of the pure Ether, the abode of Zeus.</p>
          <p>Tho peculiar rites with which her worship was <lb/>
            celebrated in different localities, together with tho <lb/>
            symbolism associated with her effigy on ancient vases <lb/>
            and coins, attest, according to Welcker, tho original <lb/>
            elemental character of the goddess. This deified im­ <lb/>
            personation of a nature-power, whether identified with <lb/>
            the Ether or the Dawn, becamo gradually invested with <lb/>
            a variety of attributes, human and superhuman ; accord­ <note type="footnote"> * Max Miiller. Lectures on Language. 2nd Series. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="xli"/>
            ingly, the Athena of the Iliad, though more sharply <lb/>
            defined than the Olympian Zeus, nevertheless exhibits <lb/>
            the same transitional character which marks the other <lb/>
            deities of the Homeric theogony. In her divine capacity <lb/>
            she is the goddess of war and of industrial art, the re­ <lb/>
            presentative of practical sagacity as opposed to poetic <lb/>
            inspiration, which was assigned to Apollo. She hears <lb/>
            and answers prayer; she acts inwardly on the minds <lb/>
            of the Hellenic heroes ; she restrains the wrath of <lb/>
            Achilles (i. 198); she imparts aid to Tydeus (iv. 390). <lb/>
            Many similar examples might be adduced. Neverthe­ <lb/>
            less she is not above the practice of deceit, as when she <lb/>
            persuades Pandarus to violate the treaty (iv. 94), and <lb/>
            also where she lures Hector with guile. Moreover, the <lb/>
            intimate connection between the bright, heaven-sprung <lb/>
            goddess and her father, which in the later mythology <lb/>
            forms one of her most striking characteristics, is only <lb/>
            slightly indicated in the Iliad (viii. 38, 373). In <lb/>
            general, her relation to the Thunderer is one of hostility; <lb/>
            she is represented as leagued with Hera and Poseidon <lb/>
            in their attempt to shackle Zeus, for whom she ex­ <lb/>
            presses her contempt in no measured terms, while with <lb/>
            Hera she appears most intimately associated : <lb/>
            “ Close sat they, side by side, and woes against the Trojans <lb/>
            plotted, <lb/>
            Truly Athena dumb abode before her proper Father, <lb/>
            Though wounded by his argument, and seized with fierce <lb/>
            displeasure, (viii. 458; iv. 21.)</p>
          <p>Traces of meteoric symbolism in connection with <lb/>
            the virgin goddess may, I think, be traced in the Iliad. <lb/>
             <pb n="xlii"/>
            Thus, in girding herself for battle, she lets fall upon <lb/>
            the starry pavement of her father the brilliant robe­ <lb/>
            "Whose tissue she herself had wrought, and with her hand <lb/>
            embroidered <lb/>
            her Ægis is the terriblo storm-cloud; her casqne, all <lb/>
            golden, measured to contain a hundred cities' footmen, <lb/>
            recalls the vaulted sky. She descends from heaven <lb/>
            like a meteor (iv. 70), or like a rainbow wrapped in <lb/>
            purple cloud (xvii. 551). Thus, too, she is described <lb/>
            as blowing with gentle breath the spear of Hector (xx. <lb/>
            410), and as becoming invisible by assuming tho casque <lb/>
            of Aides (v. 845).</p>
          <p>The flaming chariot, with its golden-trapped steeds, <lb/>
            in which she descends with Hera to the assistance of <lb/>
            the Greeks (v. 720, 748), while suggesting to the <lb/>
            imagination the bright rays of light, which spring with <lb/>
            the speed of lightning through the portals of tho cast, <lb/>
            recalls also the Vedic invocation to Ushas (the dawn) <lb/>
            to come in her ample and beautiful chariot, dispersing <lb/>
            the darkness; or wo think of tho Golden chariot of <lb/>
            Savitri, or of Indra, decorated with golden ornaments, <lb/>
            his white-footed coursers harnessed to his car with a <lb/>
            golden yoke.</p>
          <p>Tho function assigned to birds in tho Iliad seems <lb/>
            also like an echo of tho Vedas. Thus, when Athena is <lb/>
            despatched by Zeus to distil nectar and ambrosia <lb/>
            into Achilles— <lb/>
            "She plunged in semblance of a bird, the longthy-feater’d <lb/>
            osprey, <lb/>
            Shrill screaming down from upper sky." (xix. 319.) <lb/>
             <pb n="xliii"/>
            It is interesting to remember in this connection the <lb/>
            Aryan myth according to which the gods allowed the <lb/>
            heavenly soma-drink, the Vedic prototype of the <lb/>
            Grecian nectar, to be brought down to earth by a falcon. <lb/>
            In illustration of this subject Kuhn quotes two 'edic <lb/>
            hymns (R. iv. 26), (R. iv. 27), in the first of which <lb/>
            occurs the following passage :— " The speeding falcon, <lb/>
            the strong bird, allied to the gods, brought the quicken­ <lb/>
            ing, invigorating soma from afar, stealing it from <lb/>
            highest heaven."</p>
          <p>When Athena and Apollo <lb/>
            ‟Over the armies take their seats, in guise of plumèd <lb/>
            vultures, <lb/>
            Upon the lofty beech of Zeus, the Ægis-holding Father," <lb/>
            (vii. 59.) <lb/>
            they remind us of the two birds who sit in friendly <lb/>
            fashion upon the summit of the soma-bearing tree of <lb/>
            the Vedas. Thus, too, she sends a heron to greet <lb/>
            Ulysses and Diomede; they recognized the cry, and <lb/>
            rejoiced in the divine message (x. 275). Weleker <lb/>
            detects a figurative allusion to meteoric fact in the <lb/>
            epithets <foreign xml:lang="grc">γλαυκω̂πις</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">τριτογένεια</foreign>, by which the Homeric <lb/>
            Athena is distinguished.</p>
          <p>If we turn now to the Athena of Æschylus, the <lb/>
            grand impersonation of the wisdom, benignity, and <lb/>
            might of her father, we recognise, as before, the <lb/>
            emergence of the classic ideal from the symbolizing <lb/>
            tendencies of the earlier nature-worship. Seldom has <lb/>
            the imagination of poet been haunted by a more <lb/>
            majestic image than the Athena of the Eumenides; and <lb/>
             <pb n="xliv"/>
            as we picture her ‟ like an orator on the <foreign xml:lang="grc">Βη̂μα</foreign>,” <lb/>
            organizing the court of the Areopagus, she recalls the <lb/>
            grand vision of Divine Wisdom recorded in the book of <lb/>
            Proverbs (viii.). She, too, standeth in the top of high <lb/>
            places, and her voice is heard, unfolding the great <lb/>
            truth that human laws and institutions are entitled to <lb/>
            reverence only in so far as they are based upon the <lb/>
            strong foundations of eternal justice and morality. <lb/>
            " By me kings reign and princes decree justice ; <lb/>
            By me princes rule, and nobles, even all the judges of the <lb/>
            earth." Provo viii. 15, 16 ; compare Eum. (461, 535).</p>
          <p>Most emphatically does the Grecian poet proclaim <lb/>
            through the lips of Athena, that righteousness must be <lb/>
            based upon reverence and holy fear, thus coinciding <lb/>
            with the highest utterance of Hebrew wisdom ; ‟ The <lb/>
            fear of the Lord is to hate evil " (Prov. viii. 13), (Eum. <lb/>
            661, 669). Thus, too, wisdom is represented by the <lb/>
            Grecian as by the Hebrew bard, as presiding over the <lb/>
            phenomena of external nature (Prov. viii. 27), (Eum. <lb/>
            792). Yet while Athena alone unlocks the scaled <lb/>
            thunder-halls of Zeus, she, like her Hebrew prototype, <lb/>
            ‟ rejoiceth in the habitable parts of the earth," and as a <lb/>
            gardener cherishes his saplings, so ‟ she loves the raco <lb/>
            of righteous men, exempt from suffering " (Eum. 872). <lb/>
            This recognition of moral distinctions as the ground <lb/>
            of divine favour forms, perhaps, the most striking <lb/>
            point of divergence between Homer and Æschylus, and <lb/>
            forcibly recalls the high moral tone of the religion of <lb/>
            Ahura-Mazda.</p><pb n="xlv"/>
            
          <p>Truly it may be said of the Virgin Goddess that, <lb/>
            like the golden dawn, which she is thought to imper­ <lb/>
            sonate, she brightens more and more, still heralding by <lb/>
            her effulgent but imperfect light the advent of the <lb/>
            perfect day. In following the history of the Virgin <lb/>
            Goddess, it is interesting to remember that the dis­ <lb/>
            appearance of her colossal statue from the Parthenon <lb/>
            in the fifth century was coincident with the hymn <lb/>
            addressed to her by her passionate worshipper, the neo- <lb/>
            Platonist, Proclus; thus at the last ‟ she makes a <lb/>
            swan-like end, fading in music," and vanishes from <lb/>
            history, after commanding, for upwards of a thousand <lb/>
            years, the love and veneration of her votaries.</p>
          <p>In connection with the study of ancient poetry, as <lb/>
            recording the religious life of humanity, it is interesting <lb/>
            to consider the history of plastic art, which may be <lb/>
            regarded as its sensible expression, and as manifesting, <lb/>
            through the medium of ideal forms, the successive <lb/>
            stages of its development. Thus if we revert to that <lb/>
            phase of the religious life which is embodied in the <lb/>
            earliest literary relics of the Aryan race, we shall re­ <lb/>
            cognize the impossibility of embodying in harmonious <lb/>
            forms beings so impalpable as the deities apostrophized <lb/>
            by the Vedic bards. In the poetry of those early <lb/>
            times we discern the working of the untutored mind <lb/>
            struggling to body forth, through the imagery of <lb/>
            external nature, its religious yearnings and aspirations; <lb/>
            embarrassed by the complexity of unintelligible pheno­ <lb/>
            mena, and destitute of any principle of selection, the <lb/>
            imagination runs riot, blends together images the most <lb/>
             <pb n="xlvi"/>
            incongruous, and exhibits that tendency to symbolism <lb/>
            which subsequently blossomed out into the colossal <lb/>
            systems of India and Eleusis.</p>
          <p>The transference of human faith and worship from <lb/>
            vague nature-powers, dimly recognized as personal <lb/>
            agencies, to veritable personalities, endowed with con­ <lb/>
            sciousness and will, and distinguished by diversity of <lb/>
            attribute, moral and intellectual, constitutes, as we have <lb/>
            seen, the second great stage in the history of human <lb/>
            progress. This emancipation of the divine idea from <lb/>
            its association with natural phenomena would lead to <lb/>
            the recognition of the human form as affording the solo <lb/>
            adequate medium for the manifestation of spiritual <lb/>
            existence, a discovery which lies at the root of classic <lb/>
            art, and inaugurates the second epoch in the artistic <lb/>
            development of humanity. We have only to pass from <lb/>
            the Hall of Egyptian Antiquities, in tho British <lb/>
            Museum, to the gallery of the Elgin Marbles, in order <lb/>
            to appreciate the importance of the transition.</p>
          <p>The Greeks thus realizing the idea that their divini­ <lb/>
            ties manifested themselves through the human form, and <lb/>
            striving to glorify the temple hallowed by the presence <lb/>
            of Deity, were led to discover the essential charac­ <lb/>
            teristics of the human organism as a vehicle of superior <lb/>
            intelligence. In reproducing their impressions through <lb/>
            tho medium of art, they have given birth to models of <lb/>
            ideal beauty, which show us how fair is the tabernacle <lb/>
            of the immortal soul, when tho lower propensities arc <lb/>
            subjected to higher needs. They detected tho Divino <lb/>
            idea with reference to the human form, and accordingly, <lb/>
             <pb n="xlvii"/>
            in contemplating these glorious creations we experience <lb/>
            that indescribable content which invariably comes over <lb/>
            the soul, when, by any agency, we are lifted above the <lb/>
            limitations of the finite and phenomenal into the region <lb/>
            of eternal truth.</p>
          <p>Grand and beautiful as are the classic gods, they <lb/>
            nevertheless fail to touch the deepest springs of human <lb/>
            feeling. Though invested with the attributes of <lb/>
            humanity, we feel that in their emancipation from the <lb/>
            sorrows and sufferings incident to our mortal life they <lb/>
            are not true exponents of human nature, while as <lb/>
            symbols of Deity they are inadequate to shadow forth <lb/>
            the one infinite and eternal mind. From their cold <lb/>
            though perfect beauty, the heart of suffering humanity <lb/>
            turns to the thorn-crowned figure of the Son of Man, <lb/>
            and recognizes in the man of sorrows its true type and <lb/>
            representative.</p>
          <p>By revealing God as a spirit immanent in the human <lb/>
            soul, imparting authority to the oracles of conscience, <lb/>
            and sanctity to the inner life, Christianity has dispersed <lb/>
            the crowd of heathen divinities, and exalted to the <lb/>
            throne of the universe a Heavenly Father whose glory <lb/>
            is reflected in the Son of Man. Christ's realization of <lb/>
            conscious union between the divine and human spirit, <lb/>
            wrought out through the discipline of sorrow, and <lb/>
            issuing in perfect love, has revealed a depth of spiritual <lb/>
            life of which in the profoundest myths of classical <lb/>
            antiquity we see only a dim but most wonderful foro­ <lb/>
            shadowing.</p>
          <p>The transition from the classical to the romantic era <lb/>
             <pb n="xlviii"/>
            finds its explanation in these grand central truths of <lb/>
            Christianity, which have left their impress alike on art <lb/>
            and on literature. Thus, in the head of our Saviour in <lb/>
            the Cena of Leonardo da Vinci, we see that marvellous <lb/>
            union of sublimity and pathos, which, while lifting the <lb/>
            soul into a higher atmosphere, at the same time appeals <lb/>
            to the deepest sympathies of the human heart. Thus, <lb/>
            too, the grand figures of the Sistine Chapel, the pro­ <lb/>
            phets and sibyls of Michael Angelo, while exhibiting <lb/>
            the human form cast in the majestic mould of the <lb/>
            Olympian gods, bear traces, at the same time, of those <lb/>
            inner life-struggles which impart to every noteworthy <lb/>
            countenance so deep and often so tragic an interest. <lb/>
            The literary productions of the romantic era also bear <lb/>
            witness to the deeper significance which attaches to <lb/>
            human nature since the advent of Christianity—a phe­ <lb/>
            nomenon the recognition of which is essential to the <lb/>
            true appreciation of classical literature.</p>
          <p>The fundamental distinction between the ancient and <lb/>
            modern drama will bo more fully recognized if wo <lb/>
            bring into closer comparison the two great fathers of <lb/>
            dramatic art, Æschylus and Shakespeare, who, though <lb/>
            separated from one another by an interval of nearly <lb/>
            twenty centuries, yet offer somo remarkable points <lb/>
            both of analogy and contrast.</p>
          <p>In studying tho dramas of Æschylus, when we <lb/>
            penetrate below the surface, wo find that the solution <lb/>
            of problems, ethical and religious, bearing upon man's <lb/>
            nature and destiny, constitutes their essence, an object <lb/>
            to which tho delineation of character is mallo subser­ <lb/>
             <pb n="xlix"/>
            vient; whereas in the dramas of Shakespeare the de­ <lb/>
            velopment of character constitutes the primary aim, <lb/>
            to which he subordinates the underlying idea of the <lb/>
            whole ; accordingly we should vainly seek in the im­ <lb/>
            personations of the ancient bard that marvellous <lb/>
            insight into the more subtle phenomena of human <lb/>
            nature which imparts so intense an interest to the <lb/>
            productions of Shakespeare. In Æschylus the collision <lb/>
            between moral principles, whose harmonious action is <lb/>
            essential to the moral order of the world, is set forth <lb/>
            by personages, human and superhuman, whose charac­ <lb/>
            ters are drawn in bold relief, without exhibiting that <lb/>
            delicate shading which charms us in the delineation <lb/>
            of the modern bard. These personages are led in <lb/>
            obedience to one moral principle to violate another, <lb/>
            which in its turn finds advocates and champions. The <lb/>
            collision, between these opposing interests and the <lb/>
            various passions evoked in the struggle sustain the <lb/>
            interest of the drama, while the dénouement exhibits the <lb/>
            vindication of eternal order by the triumph of that <lb/>
            principle which is of primary obligation. If we apply <lb/>
            these principles to the Oresteia, we find that while the <lb/>
            several members of the trilogy are linked together by <lb/>
            a chain of ethical sequence, which resolves itself into <lb/>
            the great doctrine of retribution, each drama is at the <lb/>
            same time devoted to the solution of a particular <lb/>
            problem, and constitutes accordingly a complete and <lb/>
            independent whole.</p>
          <p>The collision of duties set forth in the Agamemnon <lb/>
            is of peculiar interest, as illustrating a struggle which <note type="footnote"> d </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="l"/>
            has its counterpart in the most touching narrative of <lb/>
            Jewish history. Agamemnon, as king and army chief, <lb/>
            receives what he believes to be a divine command to <lb/>
            propitiate Artemis by the sacrifice of his daughter; an <lb/>
            ordeal, the terrible reality of which can only be ap­ <lb/>
            preciated when we consider tho proneness to human <lb/>
            sacrifico which characterized the early ages of society. <lb/>
            Abraham, when subjected to a like trial or temptation, <lb/>
            after manifesting his perfect submission to what <lb/>
            appeared to him to be a divine monition, was led to <lb/>
            recognize the true voice of God as harmonizing with <lb/>
            the most sacred intuitions of the human heart, and <lb/>
            accordingly forbore to slay his child.. Agamemnon, <lb/>
            on the contrary, yields to the suggestion of Calchas, <lb/>
            and by the sacrifice of Iphigenia violates his obli­ <lb/>
            gations to his daughter and his wife. Clytemnestra <lb/>
            appears as the avenger of her child, and in vindication <lb/>
            of nature's violated rights, prepares for her husband <lb/>
            an ignominious death. The stern reprobation of Aga­ <lb/>
            memnon expressed by the Chorus may be compared to <lb/>
            the sublime protest of Micah, and other Hebrew <lb/>
            prophets, against such deeds of blood. Thus tho <lb/>
            cruel perversion of religion which found expression <lb/>
            in human sacrifice was condemned by tho Grecian poet <lb/>
            no less than by the Hebrew sago, a consideration which <lb/>
            invests tho Æschylean drama with profound siguifi­ <lb/>
            canco. <note type="footnote"> * I have followed Dean Stanley's interpretation of this <lb/>
            narrative. </note></p><pb n="li"/>
            
          <p>In order to appreciate the fundamental idea which <lb/>
            underlies the drama of the Choephori we must take <lb/>
            into consideration the sacred duty of avenging blood, <lb/>
            " recognized by the earliest customs and national laws <lb/>
            of the East as well as of the West."* On the murder <lb/>
            of Agamemnon by Clytemnestra, it was the bounden <lb/>
            duty of his SOIl Orestes to avenge his death ; the ghost <lb/>
            of his murdered father and the Delphic god demand it <lb/>
            of him. The collision, therefore, which forms the <lb/>
            groundwork of the drama is between the duty of <lb/>
            Orestes as the avenger of his father, and his instinctive <lb/>
            recognition of the reverence due to his mother, which <lb/>
            tends to withhold him from the commission of the <lb/>
            deed. With admirable skill the poet makes us feel <lb/>
            the terrible nature of the struggle, and the religious <lb/>
            motives which decide the issue. When Orestes, almost <lb/>
            overcome by his mother's agonizing entreaties, hesitates <lb/>
            to commit the bloody act, Pyladcs, who has accom­ <lb/>
            panied him as a representative of the god, admonishes <lb/>
            him of his duty, exclaiming­ <lb/>
            " Choose all for foemen rather than the Gods." <lb/>
            A profound thought underlies the greater heinousness <lb/>
            attached to the murder of Agamemnon by Clytem­ <lb/>
            nestra, than to the murder of Clytemnestra by Orestes. <lb/>
            The bond which unites the mother and the son, which <lb/>
            Orestes is required to violate, is instinctive, resting <lb/>
            Upon a law of nature; the tie which unites the <note type="footnote"> * Dissertations on the Eumenides. C. 0. Müller. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="lii"/>
            husband and the wife is of a different order, involving <lb/>
            intelligent volition and reciprocal engagement. Tho <lb/>
            institution of marriage, morever, lies at the root of all <lb/>
            law and order, and with the consequent permanence and <lb/>
            sanctity of the domestic relations is the sole guarantee <lb/>
            for the healthy development of society; hence the <lb/>
            conjugal tie requires to be placed under the special <lb/>
            guardianship of the gods and of eternal justice. <lb/>
            Hera, who in the Iliad plays so prominent and often <lb/>
            so undignified a part, is introduced in the Oresteia in <lb/>
            her grand matronly character, her union with Zeus <lb/>
            being alluded to as imparting sanctity to the marriage <lb/>
            tie. A comparison between the Choephori of Æschylus <lb/>
            and the Hamlet of Shakespeare may serve to exhibit <lb/>
            more strikingly tho fundamental difference between <lb/>
            the ancient and modern drama. In both tragedies the <lb/>
            father of the hero has been murdered, and the mother <lb/>
            has married the murderer; in both, the son is urged <lb/>
            by supernatural visitations to avenge the crime, and <lb/>
            both are prompted by the same motives of disappointed <lb/>
            ambition. In the ancient drama, however, tho death <lb/>
            of Agamemnon is represented as the vindication of a <lb/>
            moral principle, violated in the person of Clytemnestra. <lb/>
            Accordingly, when pleading for her life, sho not only <lb/>
            appeals to the filial revereneo of her son, but also <lb/>
            represents herself as having, by tho death of her <lb/>
            husband, accomplished the ends of divine justice. In <lb/>
            the modern drama tho murder of the king is repre­ <lb/>
            sented as an act of pure wickedness ; hence when <lb/>
            Hamlet is summoned to avenge his father's death, no <lb/>
             <pb n="liii"/>
            external object which claims his reverence intervenes <lb/>
            to check his purpose. The hesitancy must therefore <lb/>
            come from within; accordingly the collision is found <lb/>
            not in opposing moral principles, but in the personal <lb/>
            character of Hamlet. His soul is not organized to <lb/>
            perpetrate this deed of horror; consequently, wavering <lb/>
            in his resolution, and overwhelmed with disgust at the <lb/>
            world and at life, he perishes in the consummation of <lb/>
            his revenge. So marvellous is the skill with which the <lb/>
            character of Hamlet is drawn, so absorbing the in­ <lb/>
            terest which it awakens, that in studying it we are apt <lb/>
            to forget the fundamental idea which underlies the <lb/>
            drama, the dénouement of which, like that of the <lb/>
            several members of the Oresteia, sets forth the great <lb/>
            law of retribution, and vindicates the moral order of <lb/>
            the Divine government.</p>
          <p>In the third member of the trilogy, the poet, while <lb/>
            making his drama subservient to objects connected <lb/>
            with the political state of Athens, nevertheless subor­ <lb/>
            dinates these local interests to the exposition of higher <lb/>
            truth. Among these political objects the most impor­ <lb/>
            tant was the defence of the Areopagus, the existence of <lb/>
            which was threatened by the growing ascendency of the <lb/>
            democracy. It would be difficult to imagine a more <lb/>
            impressive means of recommending this tribunal to <lb/>
            the reverence of the Athenians than thus to introduce <lb/>
            the celestial powers as assisting at its inauguration. <lb/>
            Of far higher significance, however, is the ethical <lb/>
            conception which underlies the drama. The word <lb/>
            Erinys in Greek has been defined to mean “ the feeling <lb/>
             <pb n="liv"/>
            of deep offence, of bitter displeasure, when sacred rights <lb/>
            belonging to us are impiously violated by persons who <lb/>
            ought most to have respected them." These vengeance- <lb/>
            prompting feelings, personified as active, ever-wakeful <lb/>
            spirits, became associated with the great nature-power, <lb/>
            Demeter, under her more malignant aspect, and hence <lb/>
            arose the worship of the dread goddess, Demeter <lb/>
            Erinys. Both these names have been traced back to <lb/>
            the Sanscrit; the Greek Demeter being identified with <lb/>
            Dyâvâ Mâtar, the Mother, corresponding to Dyaus <lb/>
            Pitar, the Father, and the Erinyes being identified <lb/>
            with the Sanscrit Saranyû. Thus it appears that the <lb/>
            venerable goddesses, like Zeus and Athena, have their <lb/>
            root in the Vedas. “In early Greek mythology they <lb/>
            were attributed more especially to the Father, the <lb/>
            Mother, and the Elder Brother, whenever their sacred <lb/>
            rights had been impiously violated." They are thus <lb/>
            introduced in the Iliad (ix. 449; ix. 572; xv. 204), <lb/>
            where they are represented as avenging any violation <lb/>
            of the natural order.</p>
          <p>In this character they also appear at the conclusion <lb/>
            of tho Choephori, and in the opening scenes of tho <lb/>
            Eumenides, where, like blood-thirsty hounds, they <lb/>
            pursue Orestes for the murder of his mother: they <lb/>
            take cognizance only of tho outward act, and exercise <lb/>
            their functions with the inflexibility of natural law. <lb/>
            They would not tho less have claimed him as their <lb/>
            prey had ho left unavenged tho murder of his father <lb/>
            (Choeph. 283, 911). In this fatal collision Athena <lb/>
            appears as umpire: by establishing the court of <lb/>
             <pb n="lv"/>
            Areopagus she proclaims the great principle, “ that the <lb/>
            highest tribunal upon earth is the collective conscience <lb/>
            of humanity."* The cause is tried before this august <lb/>
            assembly; righteous regard is had for the special <lb/>
            circumstances of the deed; Orestes is acquitted, the <lb/>
            sanctity of the primeval goddesses is recognized; <lb/>
            their wrath is appeased, and thus the intuitive thirst <lb/>
            for revenge is transmuted into the principle of eternal <lb/>
            justice. Thus the drama of the Eumenides exhibits, <lb/>
            under one of its grandest phases, the contest between <lb/>
            the Titans and the Olympian gods, issuing in the <lb/>
            triumph of free will and moral power over blind <lb/>
            instinct and necessity, while the transmutation of the <lb/>
            Erinyes into the Eumenides symbolizes the profound <lb/>
            thought that even the instinctive tendencies in human <lb/>
            nature are implanted there by its Divine Author, and <lb/>
            consequently that man's highest well-being demands, <lb/>
            not their suppression or annihilation, but their harmo­ <lb/>
            nious subordination to the higher faculties of the soul.</p>
          <p>Classical poetry affords the true key to classic art; <lb/>
            it is, therefore, interesting to turn from the study of <lb/>
            Æschylus to the contemplation of the Parthenon, <lb/>
            where the Athenians beheld translated into marble the <lb/>
            same profound ideas which the great dramatist has <lb/>
            embodied in his immortal works. Thus the sculptures <lb/>
            of the eastern pediment, having reference to the birth <lb/>
            of Athena, indicate, by the presence of the Fates and <lb/>
            other divine personages, the deep significance attached <note type="footnote"> * ' Gott in der Gesehichte.' Bunsen. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="lvi"/>
            by the sculptor to the manifestation of Divine Wisdom <lb/>
            in the person of the Virgin Goddess; while in the <lb/>
            grand composition of the western pediment, which set <lb/>
            forth the contention of Poseidon and Athena for <lb/>
            supremacy over the country of Attica, we trace, as in <lb/>
            the Eumenides, the association of interests purely local <lb/>
            and national with truths of higher significance. Thus <lb/>
            the contending divinities have been regarded as <lb/>
            typifying the antagonism between agricultural and <lb/>
            maritime pursuits, which formed one main feature of <lb/>
            Athenian life; and also as reflecting the conflicting <lb/>
            powers of land and sea, as exhibited in the topography <lb/>
            of the interior and the coast.. I doubt not, however, <lb/>
            that there rose also before the mental vision of Phidias <lb/>
            the grand old allegory of the battle between the Titaus <lb/>
            and the Gods, which may be regarded as the mythical <lb/>
            expression of that eternal struggle between the lower <lb/>
            and higher elements of being, of which the drama of <lb/>
            the Eumenides affords so impressive and magnificent a <lb/>
            symbol: this hypothesis appears the more plausible <lb/>
            when wo consider the intimate mythological connection <lb/>
            which obtained between Poseidon and Demcter- <lb/>
            Erinys.</p>
          <p>Another most interesting illustration of the intimate <lb/>
            association which, in classical times, existed between <lb/>
            Poetry and her sister arts is to bo found in the paint­ <lb/>
            ings of Polygnotus in the Leseho at Delphi, of which <note type="footnote"> * Explanation of the Groups in the Western Pediment <lb/>

            a minute description is given by Pausanias, and which <lb/>
            have been admirably restored by Fr. and Job. Riepen­ <lb/>
            hausen.* The first picture exhibits the capture of <lb/>
            Ilion, the desecration of her sanctuaries, and brings <lb/>
            before the mental eye the outrage committed against <lb/>
            Athena in the person of Cassandra, thus setting forth <lb/>
            the origin of the disasters which befell the returning <lb/>
            armament of the Greeks: it would be impossible for <lb/>
            the beholders of this picture not to recall the speech of <lb/>
            Clytemnestra in the Agamemnon (320), in which she <lb/>
            forcibly describes the contrast between the state of <lb/>
            victors and vanquished in the captured city, the <lb/>
            desolation of which is touchingly symbolized in the <lb/>
            painting by the empty cuirass that lies on the altar to <lb/>
            which a child is clinging. The exhibition of the very <lb/>
            crimes so earnestly deprecated by the poet (330), <lb/>
            prepares the mind for the second picture, exhibiting <lb/>
            the descent of Ulysses to Hades, to learn from the <lb/>
            prophet the means by which a safe return might be <lb/>
            secured. The punishment of the sacrilegious Tityus, <lb/>
            and the retaliation on the undutiful son, could not fail <lb/>
            to suggest to the mind of the spectator those passages <lb/>
            of the Eumenides in which the poet, with terrible <lb/>
            earnestness, describes the direful fate which in the <lb/>
            lower regions is the sure award of filial impiety and <lb/>
            sacrilege (260).</p>

            throughout the length and breadth of the land bear <lb/>
            witness to the importance which is now attached to <lb/>
            artistic culture in England.</p>
          <p>It must not be forgotten, however, that imagination <lb/>
            constitutes the vital principle of art; that tho practised <lb/>
            eye and well-trained hand are powerless except as <lb/>
            instruments to embody the conceptions of the creative <lb/>
            mind. Hence the study of poetry acquires new <lb/>
            significance, not only as throwing light upon tho <lb/>
            master-works of classical antiquity, the recognized <lb/>
            models of ideal form, but also as enriching the imagi­ <lb/>
            nation, while at the same time it opens both eye and <lb/>
            soul to discern the familiar beauty of common life.</p>
          <p>What Joubert has said of Plato may be applied with <lb/>
            equal truth to poetry:—“ Platon no fait rien voir, nais <lb/>
            il éclaire, il met do la lumière dans nos yeux, ot place <lb/>
            en nous uno clarté, dont tous les objets deviennent <lb/>
            ensuito illumines. Connne l'air des montagnes sa <lb/>
            lecture aiguise les organcs, et donno lo goût des bons <lb/>
            aliments."</p>
          <p>" Of imagination, fancy, taste, of the highest cul­ <lb/>
            tivation in all its forms, this great nation has abun­ <lb/>
            dance; of industry, skill, perseverance, mechanical <lb/>
            contrivance, it has a yet larger stock, which overflows <lb/>
            our narrow bounds and floods tho world. The ono <lb/>
            great want is to bring theso two groups of qualities <lb/>
            harmoniously together.”* I believe that in poetry will <note type="footnote"> * Wedgewood, an address by the Rt. Hon. W. E <lb/>

             <pb n="lix"/>
            be found one of the missing links through whose agency <lb/>
            this alliance between the spheres of beauty and utility <lb/>
            is to be consummated. Milton speaks of “ the glorious, <lb/>
            the magnificent, uses which may be made of poetry <lb/>
            both in divine and human things;" while Shelley <lb/>
            characterized it as "a fountain for ever flowing with <lb/>
            the waters of wisdom and delight." It becomes, <lb/>
            therefore, a question of deep national interest to con­ <lb/>
            sider by what agencies these renovating and purifying <lb/>
            influences may be diffused, and brought home to the <lb/>
            heart of this great nation. From Greece, " the fountain <lb/>
            of all instruction in matters of art," we may perhaps <lb/>
            take a hint as to one large and important department <lb/>
            of national education.</p>
          <p>In this connection I am tempted to quote a passage <lb/>
            from Grote's History of Greece, where, after alluding <lb/>
            to the abundance in the productions of the tragic <lb/>
            muse, at Athens, he proceeds :—" All this abundance <lb/>
            founds its way to the minds of the great body of the <lb/>
            citizens, not excepting even the poorest. So powerful <lb/>
            a body of poetic influence has probably never been <lb/>
            brought to act upon the emotions of any other popula­ <lb/>
            tion ; and when we consider the extraordinary beauty <lb/>
            of these immortal compositions, which first stamped <lb/>
            tragedy as a separate department of poetry, and gave <lb/>
            to it a dignity never since reached, we shall be <lb/>
            satisfied that the tastes, the sentiments, and the intel­ <lb/>
            lectual standard of the Athenian multitude must have <lb/>
            been sensibly improved and exalted by such lessons. <lb/>
            The reception of such pleasures through the eye and <lb/>
             <pb n="lx"/>
            ear, as well as amidst a sympathizing crowd, was a <lb/>
            fact of no small importance in the mental history of <lb/>
            Athens. It contributed to exalt their imagination, <lb/>
            like the grand edifices and ornaments added during the <lb/>
            same period to the Acropolis."</p>
          <p>The designs of Flaxman from Homer' and Æschylus <lb/>
            are wrought into our damask and engraved upon our <lb/>
            glass; it is time that the thoughts of the great poets, <lb/>
            from whom he drew his inspiration, should be brought <lb/>
            home, with all their rich treasure of imagery to the <lb/>
            hearts and minds of our people. What noble enter­ <lb/>
            tainment might not be drawn from “ Heroic poems and <lb/>
            Attic tragedies of stateliest and most regal ornament," <lb/>
            if, appealing as they do to the feelings of our common <lb/>
            humanity, they were made appreciable to the popular <lb/>
            understanding by illustrations drawn from history and <lb/>
            art!</p>
          <p>With reference to the moral influence of poetry, <lb/>
            Joubert says, "Voulez-vous connaître la morale? <lb/>
            Lisez les poëtes; ee qui vous plait chez eux, appro­ <lb/>
            fondissez-lo; c'est le vrai; ils doivent être la grando <lb/>
            étude du philosophe qui veut eonnaitro l'hommo."</p>
          <p>Believing that Æsehylus strikingly corroborates this <lb/>
            utteranee, in all humility I offer to the public this <lb/>
            version of his greatest work.</p><pb n="-"/>

            My father at the altar fell, but me <lb/>

            For Atreus, Argos' ruler, this man's father, <lb/>
            Did from the city and his home expel <lb/>
            Thyestes, rival in the sovereignty,- <lb/>
            My father, to be plain, and his own brother. <lb/>

            Atreus, with zeal officious more than kind, <lb/>
            Feigning a joyous banquet-day to hold, 1570 <lb/>
            Served to my sire, for food, his children's flesh. <lb/>

            Be ye partakers in my counsel, friends, <lb/>
            For in this house one common hate we share. <lb/>

            (II. ix. 529), is fundamentally opposed to that of the later <lb/>
            poets. In Homer nothing is heard of the fatal brand. <lb/>
            Meleager had, in some unfortunate fray, killed his mother's <lb/>
            brother; upon which his mother solemnly cursed him, and <lb/>
            prayed to Pluto and Persephone for his death. At this he <lb/>
            was so indignant (or so paralysed for battle by believing in <lb/>
            the curse), that he refused to defend his native city, Calydon, <lb/>
            at a critical moment, and was only at last prevailed on by <lb/>
            his wife to take arms and save it. Here the story ends in <lb/>
            Homer ; though he says that the Fury who stalks in darkness <lb/>
            heard the mother's curse. </note><note type="footnote"> According to the later poets, Meleager had slain seven <lb/>
            brothers of his mother. At his birth she had been informed <lb/>
            by the Fates that he would live until a certain log of wood <lb/>
            then burning on the hearth was consumed. On this she <lb/>
            snatched it off, extinguished it, and kept it carefully in a <lb/>

          <p>From Phocis I, a Daulian, stranger here.- <lb/>
            What time my home I left, for Argos bound, <lb/>
            Starting on foot, with baggage self-equipped, <lb/>
            A man to me unknown, as I to him, <lb/>
            Met me, inquired my route and told me his <lb/>
            Strophios, the Phocian, as in talk I learned. <lb/>
            " Stranger," he said, “ since Argos is thy goal, <lb/>
            Say to the parents,”—strictly mark my words,­ <lb/>
            “ Dead is Orestes;—grave it on thy mind;— <lb/>
            Whether the counsel of his friends prevail 670 <lb/>

            Alien for aye;—bear thou their mandates back; <lb/>
            For now the brazen urn doth shroud from sight <lb/>
            The ashes of the hero duly wept." <lb/>

            <title type="sub">A FEW NOTES ON THE TEXT, BY F. W. NEWMAN.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>THE text of this play, especially in the Choral Odes, is mani­ <lb/>
            festly very corrupt, and the corruption may have been a <lb/>
            thousand years earlier than any MS. of it which came down <lb/>
            to the age of printing. The Greek Commentator, whom we <lb/>
            call the Scholiast, is often puerile, and absurdly satisfied <lb/>
            with a very erroneous text. Thereby we are driven to con­ <lb/>
            jectural improvement, if we are to attain a text worthy of <lb/>
            the poet. Some of the following suggestions, I believe, seemed <lb/>
            to my friend Miss Anna Swan wick to deserve her acceptance.</p>
          <p>v. 56. Read <foreign xml:lang="grc">μένει χρονίζοντας ἅχη</foreign>, omitting <foreign xml:lang="grc">βρύει</foreign>.</p>
          <p>64. Here retain <foreign xml:lang="grc">βρύειν</foreign>, probably with <foreign xml:lang="grc">παγκαρτέρας</foreign> for <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">παναρκέτας</foreign>.</p>
          <p>65. For <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐκ μια̑ς ὁδου̑</foreign>, I wish <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐκ παγκυμίας ὁμοὑ</foreign>.</p>
          <p>67. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἰοὑσαν ἂτην</foreign> all reject, <foreign xml:lang="grc">μάτην</foreign> meets general approval; <lb/>
            but we seem to need <foreign xml:lang="grc">κλύσειεν ἂν μάτην</foreign> before metre and <lb/>
            sense are satisfied.</p>
          <p>71, 72, we require [<foreign xml:lang="grc">δε</foreign>ȋ] <foreign xml:lang="grc">δίκαια, μὴ</foreign> Strata, [<foreign xml:lang="grc">μὴ</foreign>] <foreign xml:lang="grc">πρέποντ ̓ <lb/>
            ἀρχα</foreign>ȋ<foreign xml:lang="grc">σι μον</foreign>, for <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀρχα</foreign>ȋ<foreign xml:lang="grc">ς βίου</foreign>; and in 73, <foreign xml:lang="grc">βίαια φυρωμέων</foreign> for <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">βίαι φερομένων</foreign>.</p>
          <p>150. <foreign xml:lang="grc">σεβάσω</foreign> must be wrong; <foreign xml:lang="grc">σεβάσια</foreign> (reverential), though <lb/>
            not in our dictionaries, may be right. This piece is Anti­ <lb/>
            strophic, but the Antistrophe abounds in small errors. I <lb/>
            propose: 152, for <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀνὴρ</foreign> to read <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἂν ἥκοι</foreign>; in 154, <foreign xml:lang="grc">τίς ἐκ κερο</foreign>ȋ<foreign xml:lang="grc">ν <lb/>
            παλιτόνοιν ἐνεργο</foreign>ȋ for vulg. <foreign xml:lang="grc">τἄ</foreign> r' <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐκχερο</foreign>ȋ<foreign xml:lang="grc">ν παλίντονα ἐν ἔργῳ</foreign>. <pb n="134"/>
             </p>
          <p>270. Hermann has arbitrarily changed <foreign xml:lang="grc">μειλίγματα</foreign> (as­ <lb/>
            suagements) into its opposite, <foreign xml:lang="grc">μηνίματα</foreign>, but <foreign xml:lang="grc">πιφασκων</foreign> is the <lb/>
            faulty word. The smallest available change is to place a <lb/>
            comma after <foreign xml:lang="grc">βροτο</foreign>ȋ<foreign xml:lang="grc">ς</foreign> (other mortals), and write <foreign xml:lang="grc">πιφαύσκειν <lb/>
            εἶπε τάσδε νῷν</foreign>.... Here <foreign xml:lang="grc">πιφαύσκειν</foreign> means <foreign xml:lang="grc">προφαίνειν</foreign>, <lb/>
            with a future idea as presently in <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπαντέλλειν</foreign>.</p>
          <p>361. The sense seems manifestly to require <foreign xml:lang="grc">πάρος δὲ, <lb/>
            τοὺς κτανόν τας νιν οὓτω δαμη̑ναι</foreign>, [<foreign xml:lang="grc">καὐτω̑ν</foreign>] <foreign xml:lang="grc">θαν</foreign>....</p>
          <p>368. For <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὀδυνα̑σαι</foreign>, Dindorf has <foreign xml:lang="grc">δύνασαι</foreign>, but the sense <lb/>
            requires <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐ δύνασαι</foreign>.</p>
          <p>370. For <foreign xml:lang="grc">τω̑ν μὲν ἀρωγοὶ</foreign>, which is unintelligible, I believe <lb/>
            the poet wrote in continuation, <foreign xml:lang="grc">δου̑πος ἱκνε</foreign>ȋ<foreign xml:lang="grc">ται σφῷν μὲν <lb/>
            ἀργὸν</foreign>.... Even so it is quite unexplained what is the <lb/>
            " double scourge." Orestes complains of Penury, Electra of <lb/>
            Dishonor. These may well be the double misery which <lb/>
            (says the Chorus) thou art unable [to avert]. To me a <lb/>
            whole line seems lost, such as : <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BELL_22_fig8.jpg"/></figure> <lb/>
              Thus <foreign xml:lang="grc">δύνασαι</foreign> has an infinitive <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀπείργειν</foreign> to complete it, "To <lb/>
              wish for lofty success is useless, when you cannot [even repel <lb/>
              Penury and Insult]." The crack of this double scourge <lb/>
              reaches now your champion in the underworld."</p>
          <p>374. <foreign xml:lang="grc">παισὶ δὲ μα̑λλον γεγένηται</foreign> is hopeless nonsense. <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">Μα̑λλον</foreign> has nothing to compare. <foreign xml:lang="grc">Γεγένηται</foreign>, " it has be­ <lb/>
            come," has ucither Predicate nor Subject. Neither word is <lb/>
            here endurable. I find nothing more probable than to write <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">τέρμων</foreign> for <foreign xml:lang="grc">τούτων</foreign>, With : <foreign xml:lang="grc">Στυγερω̑ν τέρμων</foreign> | <foreign xml:lang="grc">παισὶ δ ̓ ἁμιλλω̑ν <lb/>
            πεπόνηται</foreign>. " But for (or by) the children a limit of hateful <lb/>
            contests has been hard-earned." The unusual position of at, <lb/>
            in the fourth place may have led to punctuating after <foreign xml:lang="grc">τέρμων</foreign>. <lb/>
            On this wouldfollow a general corruption.</p><pb n="135"/>
            
          <p>377. For <foreign xml:lang="grc">τελε</foreign>ȋ<foreign xml:lang="grc">ται</foreign>, I propose <foreign xml:lang="grc">τέλει σύ</foreign>.</p>
          <p>384-407. Strophe and Antistrophe both corrupt. In my <lb/>
            notion :-</p>

          <p>391. Read <foreign xml:lang="grc">Πιστὰ δ ̓ ἕλοιτο</foreign>.... may (Jupiter) elect <lb/>
            Trustees, Regents."</p>
          <p>400. Omit <foreign xml:lang="grc">φθιμέων</foreign>. <lb/>
            613. For <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀκαίρως δὲ</foreign>, I suggest <foreign xml:lang="grc">Ἀχαιο</foreign>ȋ<foreign xml:lang="grc">ς γε</foreign>. For <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀπεύχετον</foreign>, <lb/>
            I accept Blomfield's <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀπευκτέον</foreign>. For <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπικότῳ</foreign>, metre and sense <lb/>
            require <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὑπερκότῳ</foreign>. Place a colon after it: then for <foreign xml:lang="grc">σέβας τίων</foreign> <lb/>
            I claim <foreign xml:lang="grc">σεβαστέον</foreign>.</p>
          <p>633. A verb is lost to which the vulgate <foreign xml:lang="grc">παρεκβάντες</foreign> is <lb/>
            nomin. and <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸ μὴ θέμις πατεύμενον</foreign> is accusative. The particle <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐ</foreign> makes sheer nonsense. I propose, instead of it, the verb <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὤλεσαν</foreign>. In the Antist. to contrast child and father, I <lb/>
            imagine <foreign xml:lang="grc">τέκνον</foreign> 8' <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπεισφέρει δόμοισι</foreign> [<foreign xml:lang="grc">το</foreign>ȋ<foreign xml:lang="grc">ς πατρὸς, χ ̓</foreign>] <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">αἱμάτων</foreign>. No one will say that <foreign xml:lang="grc">πατρὸς</foreign> is here superfluous, <lb/>
            nor can any smaller change reconcile the metres.</p>
          <p>773. In this eminently corrupt Ode, nothing but audacity <lb/>
            can succeed. I propose:</p>
          <p><figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BELL_22_fig11.jpg"/></figure></p>
          <p>783. For <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐν δρόμῳ προστιθεὶς</foreign>, I suggest <foreign xml:lang="grc">κἀν δρόμῳ προσ­ <lb/>
            τιθείης</foreign>....</p><pb n="136"/>

            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἔμπεδον</foreign>.... <lb/>
            [<foreign xml:lang="grc">κτίσας</foreign> is my conjecture, or say, stop-gap, for the impossible <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">τίς</foreign> a<foreign xml:lang="grc">ν</foreign>.]</p>
          <p>793. Read <foreign xml:lang="grc">το</foreign>ȋ<foreign xml:lang="grc">νδε καλω̑ς κταμένοιν</foreign>, and herewith end the <lb/>
            third strophe.</p>
          <p>795. For <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀνιδε</foreign>ȋ<foreign xml:lang="grc">ν</foreign>, which cannot here be right, perhaps <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀναπνε</foreign>ȋ<foreign xml:lang="grc">ν</foreign>, gain respite.</p>
          <p>799. For <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπιφορώτατος</foreign>, metre and sense suggest o <foreign xml:lang="grc">φωριώ­ <lb/>
            τατος</foreign>. (To change <foreign xml:lang="grc">νομίζετε</foreign> in the strophe for the con­ <lb/>
            venience of this <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπιφορώτατος</foreign> cannot be approved.)</p>
          <p>801. For <foreign xml:lang="grc">κρύπτ ̓ ἄσκοπον</foreign> 8', I require <foreign xml:lang="grc">κρύφα μὲν εὓσκοπον <lb/>
            δ ̓</foreign>, giving right metre and sense.</p>
          <p>802. For <foreign xml:lang="grc">νύκτα πρ</foreign>ó <foreign xml:lang="grc">τ ̓ ὀμμάτων</foreign> read <foreign xml:lang="grc">νύκτωρ προὐμμάτων</foreign>.</p>
          <p>803. For <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐμφανέστερος</foreign>, Schütz well writes <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐμφανέστεν. <lb/>
            χρῄζων</foreign> is a superfluous word. I think <foreign xml:lang="grc">πολλά δἐ κἄλλα φαε</foreign>ȋ <lb/>
            should close the 3rd antistrophe.</p>
          <p>805. The 4th and 5th are variously corrupt. I believe in <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">καὶ τότ ̓ ὠδὰν, κλυτὸν δωμάτων λύτρον</foreign>- <lb/>
            [Song, opposed to twanging of the lyre.] I try further:</p>
          <p><figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BELL_22_fig12.jpg"/></figure> <foreign xml:lang="grc">Τάδε</foreign> nomin. will mean " Songs and Music.” No smaller <lb/>
              changes can succeed ; but the words <foreign xml:lang="grc">εἴνουν ἔμοιγε</foreign> are neces­ <lb/>
              sarily very uncertain. Vulg. d <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐμὸν ἐμὸν</foreign>.</p>
          <p>815. For <foreign xml:lang="grc">περαίνων</foreign> excellently Blomf. has <foreign xml:lang="grc">πέαιν ̓ οὐκ</foreign>.</p>
          <p>820. <foreign xml:lang="grc">προπρα̑ξον χάριν αφαγα̑ς λυτη̑ρος</foreign> is a possible text. <lb/>
            In next line <foreign xml:lang="grc">τιθεὶς</foreign> can hardly he right. The sense wanted <lb/>
            is " from thy inmost heart venting rage.” <foreign xml:lang="grc">καθεὶς</foreign> or <foreign xml:lang="grc">μεθεὶς</foreign> <lb/>
            is possible. Paley's correction of <foreign xml:lang="grc">φοινίαν ἄταν</foreign> into <foreign xml:lang="grc">φοινίαν <lb/>
            ἄγαν</foreign> (sanguinary rancour) quite commends itself.</p><pb n="137"/>
            
          <p>940-7 is terribly corrupt. No one can make good sense, <lb/>
            good structure, and good metre without grave changes. I <lb/>
            have proposed <figure type="illustration">

          <p>949. A new enigma. The word in brackets might be <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ποίμενα</foreign>. I do not believe it was. It might be <foreign xml:lang="grc">μείρακα</foreign>; <lb/>
            but the edd. give us <foreign xml:lang="grc">ψάλιον</foreign>. I have imagined <foreign xml:lang="grc">τάλιδα</foreign>, <lb/>
            equivalent to <foreign xml:lang="grc">παρθένον</foreign>, and here used of a young man, as <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">παρθένον</foreign> notoriously may be. That the termination does <lb/>
            not necessitate a feminine idea, we see in <foreign xml:lang="grc">ψαλίδα</foreign>. Then for <lb/>

          <p>THIS drama, founded upon the Persian War, and pro­ <lb/>
            duced only seven years after its termination (B.C. 472), <lb/>
            is invested with peculiar interest, not only as the <lb/>
            earliest Æschylean drama which has come down to us, <lb/>
            but also as our earliest extant Greek history, the first <lb/>
            recorded recitation of Herodotus having taken place at <lb/>
            the great Panathenæa. at Athens (B.C. 446). It ex­ <lb/>
            hibits, moreover, the same principles of dramatic art, <lb/>
            and the same conceptions respecting the divine govern­ <lb/>
            ment which characterise the purely imaginative pro­ <lb/>
            ductions of the " warrior-bard." For its full apprecia­ <lb/>
            tion we must endeavour to realise the magnitude of <lb/>
            the struggle which it commemorates, together with the <lb/>
            momentous consequences to Hellas and to the world <lb/>
            which resulted from the Hellenic victory.</p>
          <p>About eighty years before the battle of Salamis <lb/>
            (fought B.C. 480) the Persians had made their first <lb/>
            appearance in history, when, under their leader. <lb/>
            Cyrus, they overthrew the empire of the Medes (B.C. <lb/>
            559). Within this comparatively brief interval they <lb/>
            had brought under subjection not only the native <lb/>
            peoples of Asia, but also large areas of Europe and <note type="footnote"> 0 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="194"/>
            Africa. At the time of our drama their empire ex­ <lb/>
            tended southward over Egypt to Cyrenaica, while to <lb/>
            the north it comprised Maritime Thrace, Pæonca, and <lb/>
            apparently Macedonia, as far as the borders of Thessaly, <lb/>
            besides nearly all the islands of the Ægean, north of <lb/>
            Krete and cast of Eubœa. Their ambition expanded <lb/>
            with their conquests, till, at length, they aspired to <lb/>
            universal dominion. "The conquest of Greece was <lb/>
            represented by Xerxes as carrying with it that of all <lb/>
            Europe, so that the Persian empire would become co­ <lb/>
            extensive with the Æther of Zeus, and the limits of <lb/>
            the Sun's course."</p>
          <p>The idea. upon which this colossal empire was based <lb/>
            was that of the despotic force of personal will, involving <lb/>
            obligation of universal personal service, especially in <lb/>
            war. During the expedition of Xerxes the tributaries <lb/>
            of the Persian king were virtually slaves, working <lb/>
            under the lash, and driven on to the charge in battle <lb/>
            with the scourge. The profound humiliation of the <lb/>
            subject peoples is forcibly depicted by the Chorus, in <lb/>
            the ode wherein they lament the overthrow of the <lb/>
            Persian power (v. 58G).</p>
          <p>Meanwhile, in the heart of Hellas, a new phase of <lb/>
            political life had been developed; Athens I ad thrown <lb/>
            off the yoke of her tyrants, tho Pisistratids, and the <lb/>
            world saw, for the first time, a state composed of free <lb/>
            and equal citizens. The revolution of Kleisthenes <lb/>
            bad established the principles of free speech and equal <lb/>
            law, while as yet this now-born liberty had not degene­ <lb/>
            rated into licence. Adverting to the Athenian cou­ <lb/>
             <pb n="195"/>
            stitution at the time when the Persians made their <lb/>
            attack on Hellas, Plato says, " Reverence was then our <lb/>
            queen and mistress, and made us willing to live in <lb/>
            obedience to the laws." The strength of patriotic <lb/>
            sentiment generated by the new constitution inspired <lb/>
            the amazing courage required in the Athenians to <lb/>
            encounter the hitherto unconquered hosts of Persia ; <lb/>
            upon the plain of Marathon they triumphed, and their <lb/>
            glorious victory arrested, for a time, the encroachments <lb/>
            of the Persian king.</p>
          <p>His son Xerxes undertook to avenge the disaster <lb/>
            which had befallen the Persian arms: after enormous <lb/>
            preparations, he set forth on his expedition, at the head <lb/>
            of an army composed of forty-six different nations, each <lb/>
            with its distinct national costume and local leaders, <lb/>
            while eight other nations furnished the fleet. Well <lb/>
            might the contemporary world be overawed by the <lb/>
            spectacle of so prodigious an armament, and regard the <lb/>
            cause of Hellenic independence as desperate.</p>
          <p>The victory of Salamis shattered the power of the <lb/>
            barbarians, and changed the destiny of the world. <lb/>
            " ' Let there be light!' said Liberty, <lb/>
            And, like sunrise from the sea, <lb/>
            Athens arose."</p>
          <p>In celebration of the victory thus achieved by <lb/>
            struggling and triumphant freedom, and in honour <lb/>
            of the city of Pallas, which had won immortal <lb/>
            glory at Salamis, Æschylus composed his drama of <lb/>
            The Persians.' It has been justly remarked that <lb/>
            " Æschylus is the prophet of Greek tragedy." " A <lb/>
             <pb n="196"/>
            single episode, a single generation, was insufficient for <lb/>
            the display of the dependence of life upon life, and the <lb/>
            moral infinitude of action which it was his design to <lb/>
            exhibit. Thus he habitually composed groups of <lb/>
            three connected plays, which gave full scope for the <lb/>
            development of thought and work."*</p>
          <p>Unfortunately, we possess only the second member <lb/>
            of the trilogy, which, consisting of three separate <lb/>
            dramas, severally entitled, Phineus, The Persians, and <lb/>
            Glaukos, ╇ appears to have been known among the <lb/>
            ancients by the general name of ' The Persians.' To <lb/>
            this trilogy was appended: the Satyric drama of <lb/>
            " Prometheus, the Fire-kindler." Though the second <lb/>
            member of this trilogy is alone based upon history, <note type="footnote"> * " Æschylus as a Religious Teacher."—Brook F. West­ <lb/>
            cott. </note><note type="footnote"> ╇ The ancient Greek argument informs us that <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὲπί Μένωνος <lb/>

            ΙΙρομηθι̑</foreign>. Fragments, however, exist of another Æchyh an <lb/>
            drama, entitled Glaukos Pontios, and various arguments are <lb/>
            adduced by Welcker and Gruppe to prove that this drama, <lb/>
            rather than the Glaukos Potnieus, formed the third member <lb/>
            of the Persian trilogy. This view is supported by W. v. <lb/>
            Humboldt, Schlegel, K. 0. Müller, and other learned men. <lb/>
            It seems, I confess, hard to understand why the error should <lb/>
            have been made on several different occasions by several <lb/>
            different writers. The principal reason for regardin. Glaukos <lb/>
            Potnieus as wrong seems to be the difficulty of discovering <lb/>
            any link of connection between that legendary hero, the <lb/>
            father of Bellerophontes, and the termination of the Persian <lb/>
            war. In the text I have adopted the hypotheisof Welcker <lb/>
            and Gruppe, and have given a brief epitome of their views <lb/>
            respecting the Glaukos Pontios. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="197"/>
            while the first and third, together with the Satyric <lb/>
            drama, draw their materials from mythological sources, <lb/>
            it appears almost certain that these apparently in­ <lb/>
            congruous elements constituted together one grand <lb/>
            poetic whole; the leading idea giving unity to the <lb/>
            detached dramas being the struggle between Asia and <lb/>
            Europe, which, originating in the dim ages of my­ <lb/>
            thology, had at length culminated in the triumph of <lb/>
            Hellas over the non-Hellenic races. In the same <lb/>
            manner Herodotus has based his history upon the <lb/>
            notion of a primeval enmity subsisting between the <lb/>
            Hellenes and the nations of the East. This apparent <lb/>
            incongruity vanishes when we remember that the con­ <lb/>
            temporaries of Æschylus cherished the firmest belief <lb/>
            in the existence of their legendary heroes, whose pro­ <lb/>
            tection and assistance were continually invoked, while <lb/>
            their appearance on the scene of action, with super­ <lb/>
            human stature and imposing mien, was hailed as an <lb/>
            omen of victory. Æschylus has, moreover, in the <lb/>
            second member of the trilogy, so treated the events of <lb/>
            contemporary history as to bring them into harmony <lb/>
            with the occurrences of the mythical past, invested, as <lb/>
            it was, in the popular imagination, with a halo of <lb/>
            glory and sublimity. This was rendered possible <lb/>
            by the remoteness of Persia, which was selected as <lb/>
            the scene of the drama; by the gorgeous splendour <lb/>
            which surrounded Oriental life; by the vastness of <lb/>
            the armies assembled under the sceptre of the great <lb/>
            king, together with the strangeness of the barbaric <lb/>
            physiognomy and costume. "These, exaggerated to <lb/>
             <pb n="198"/>
            still greater proportions in the popular imagination, <lb/>
            produced an impression of dim and indefinite greatness <lb/>
            not unlike that in which the midst of timo veiled tho <lb/>
            heroes of mythology."*</p>
          <p>Another feature of tho Æschylean ago is the im­ <lb/>
            portanco attached to prophecy, which, as we learn from <lb/>
            Herodotus, not unfrequently determined the judgments <lb/>
            of men, both Greeks and Asiatics; which also we find <lb/>
            employed by our poet as tho most convenient link for <lb/>
            connecting tho separate members of his trilogies. <lb/>
            Thus, in the Oresteia, tho Agamemnon is connected <lb/>
            with the Choephori through Cassandra's prophecy of <lb/>
            the vengeance which was speedily to fall upon the <lb/>
            guilty pair. If wo turn now to the drama of ' Tho <lb/>
            Persians,' we find the Ghost of Darius referring in tho <lb/>
            most emphatic manner to certain ancient oracles <lb/>
            (v. 739), of which tho calamities which had befallen <lb/>
            the Persians were tho recognised fulfilment. It has <lb/>
            been remarked by Welcker that in this passage allusion <lb/>
            is obviously made to something which had been <lb/>
            brought before tho minds of tho spectators in tho <lb/>
            previous drama, and this hypothesis is confirmed by <lb/>
            the prophetic character of Phincus, from whom tho <lb/>
            first member of tho trilogy derives its name.</p>
          <p>Phincus is represented in mythological story as ono <lb/>
            of tho sons of Agènor,† tho father of tho beautiful <lb/>
            Europa ; and it is roleted of Agènor by Ovid, and other <lb/>
            classical writers, that ho sent forth his sons in quest of <note type="footnote"> * " Æschylus."—<unclear>ginald</unclear> S. Coplestone. </note><note type="footnote"> t Apollonius ; Argoauto (ii. v. 237) ; Gruppe. </note> <lb/>

            their sister, whose abduction by Zeus was represented <lb/>
            by Persian literati as the first act of the conflict between <lb/>
            the Eastern and the Western world: this version <lb/>
            of the Phineus legend would offer, as remarked by <lb/>
            Gruppe, an obvious link of connection with the Persian <lb/>
            war. There are other versions of the story which, <lb/>
            notwithstanding some discrepancies as to the genealogy <lb/>
            of Phineus, and the circumstances of his blindness, <lb/>
            agree in investing him with the prophetic character, <lb/>
            and in bringing him into connection with the Argo­ <lb/>
            nauts, the grand national adventurers of Hellas.</p>
          <p>In the single extant fragment of the Æschylean <lb/>
            Phineus reference appears to be made to the Harpies: <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BELL_22_fig17.jpg"/></figure> <lb/>
              Phineus, according to the ancient legend, was delivered <lb/>
              from the Harpies by the Boreades; * and it is related <lb/>
              by Apollonius (xi. 317) that, after his deliverance, he <lb/>
              prophesied, and foretold to the Argonauts the success­ <lb/>
              ful issue of their enterprise. In accordance with the <lb/>

              war : Æschylus would probably give greater scope to <lb/>
              the prophecies of Phineus, and would thus have an <lb/>
              opportunity of carrying back the imagination of the <lb/>
              audience to the traditionary commencement of the <lb/>
              great struggle which had recently been brought to so <lb/>
              glorious a termination. Thus, according to Welcker, <lb/>
              the mythological drama of Phineus would form a kind <lb/>
              of prophetic prelude to the historical drama of ' The <lb/>
              Persians.'</p>
          <p>Reference has already been made to the tendency of <lb/>
            Æschylus to group together a long scries of events, <lb/>
            having reference to some connecting principle. It <lb/>
            might therefore excite surprise that, in treating so <lb/>
            momentous a subject as the Persian war, lie should <lb/>
            have contented himself with celebrating tho battle of <lb/>
            Salamis alone, which, however glorious for Athens, left <lb/>
            tho fate of Hellas still undecided. This would be <lb/>
            brought home with peculiar force to the Athenians <lb/>
            who, only ten months after the retreat of Xerxes, had <lb/>
            been obliged to migrate a second time to Salamis, <lb/>
            while Athens became onco more the head-quarters of <lb/>
            their dreaded too. Tho victory of Platæa, which <lb/>
            insured tho final deliverance of Hellas, would there­ <lb/>
            foro bo regarded as second in importance only to <lb/>
            Salamis. Moreover, in tho drama of 'Tho Persians,' <lb/>
            tho ghost of Darius alludes to the battle-field of Platæa <lb/>
            on which the ruin of the Persian host was to bo con­ <lb/>
            summated, as the just punishment inflicted by Zeus <lb/>
            upon their impiety and overweening thoughts.</p>
          <p>This prophecy alone would suggest the probability of <lb/>
             <pb n="201"/>
            some reference being made to this important victory in <lb/>
            the third member of the trilogy, the Glaukos Potnieus. <lb/>
            According to popular tradition Glaukos was a fisher­ <lb/>
            man, who became a marine demigod by eating of the <lb/>
            divine life-giving herb sown by Kronos: one version <lb/>
            of the legend represents him to have been one of the <lb/>
            Argonauts, who, having fallen from his galley, suffered <lb/>
            this transformation. The so-called grotto of Glaukos <lb/>
            was situated near the little town of Anthedon in <lb/>
            Bœotia : this marine deity, accompanied by strange <lb/>
            monsters of the sea, was accustomed, once a year, to <lb/>
            visit the surrounding coasts and islands, and there to <lb/>
            prophesy impending calamity. His approach was <lb/>
            anticipated by the fishermen, by whom he was held <lb/>
            in peculiar veneration, who also offered sacrifice and <lb/>
            prayers to avert the threatened woe. It is mentioned <lb/>
            by Pausanias (ix. 22, 6), that what Pindar and <lb/>
            Æschylus heard from the dwellers at Anthedon con­ <lb/>
            cerning this marine deity had furnished materials to <lb/>
            both poets, and had sufficed to Æschylus for the <lb/>
            creation of a drama. According to Welcker, the <lb/>
            extant fragments of this drama seem to indicate that <lb/>
            Glaukos describes a voyage which he made from <lb/>
            Anthedon to Sicily. Passing the promontory of <lb/>
            Eubœa, the shore of Zeus Kenæus, and the tomb of <lb/>
            the unhappy Lichas (frag. 27), he came to Rhegium <lb/>
            (frag. 31, 189 ; Herm. p. 12), and arrived finally at <lb/>
            Himera (frag. 28) in Sicily. In the neighbourhood <lb/>
            of this city was fought the battle of Himera, on <lb/>
            which occasion the Sicilian Hellenes repulsed tho <lb/>
             <pb n="202"/>
            Carthaginian invaders, whose attack took place simul­ <lb/>
            taneously with that of Xerxes upon Hellas. It is <lb/>
            hardly to be supposed that Æschylus would introduce <lb/>
            into his drama the name of Himera without com­ <lb/>
            memorating a victory, which his contemporary, Pindar <lb/>
            (Pyth. i. 152), represents as not inferior in importance <lb/>
            to those of Salamis and Platæa, the circumstances of <lb/>
            which also were peculiarly susceptible of poetic treat­ <lb/>
            ment. Tho Bœotian sea-god, moreover, would form <lb/>
            tho most appropriate herald of tho Bœotian victory, <lb/>
            and thius, in his third drama, Æschylus would have tho <lb/>
            opportunity of bringing the battles of Himera and <lb/>
            Platæa into connection with that of Salamis, which <lb/>
            formed the main feature in the Persian trilogy.</p>
          <p>Tho plastic art of tho Hellenes illustrates their <lb/>
            tendency to regard tho successive victories of Hellas <lb/>
            over Oriental barbarism as phases of tho great struggle <lb/>
            between the higher and lower elements of civilization, <lb/>
            which formed so prominent a feature in their my­ <lb/>
            thology. Thus, in tho temple of Hera, at Mycenæ <lb/>
            (Paus. xi. 17, 3), and in that of Zeus at Agrigentum <lb/>
            (Diod. xi. 82), the capture of Ilium was associated with <lb/>
            tho overthrow of the giants by tho Olympian gods.* <lb/>
            Their recent splendid victories would doubtless bo <lb/>
            similarly regarded by them as the ultimate triumph of <lb/>
            civilization over barbarism, brought about by tho <lb/>
            intervention of the higher powers. This conception <lb/>
            has found artistic expression in tho beautiful painting <lb/>
            on tho so-called Darius vase, "on which the celestial <note type="footnote"> * Welcker. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="203"/>
            dcities are represented as consoling the terrified Hellas <lb/>
            in face of the threatening purposes and preparations of <lb/>
            the mighty king of Asia." Moreover, "out of the <lb/>
            gigantic block of Persian marble at Rhamnus, three <lb/>
            leagues from Marathon, which the Persians are said to <lb/>
            have intended for a trophy, Phidias (also a prophet) <lb/>
            created one of the most sublime of the Greek statues <lb/>
            of the gods, that of Nemesis, whose stern form and <lb/>
            gesture admonished the Greeks: ' Be not lifted up; to <lb/>
            God alone belongs the glory !' "*</p>
          <p>It may be remarked, in conclusion, that this drama, <lb/>
            by the profound humiliation of Xerxes, strikingly <lb/>
            enforces the Hellenic principle that the supreme <lb/>
            intelligence, which Æschylus invariably identifies with <lb/>
            the will of Zeus, cannot suffer any inferior power, <lb/>
            human or divine, to overpass its legitimate limits, and <lb/>
            thus interfere with the harmonious working of the <lb/>
            whole. At the same time the dignity of the Persian <lb/>
            empire is vindicated by the description of the glorious <lb/>
            and happy life which the Persians enjoyed under the <lb/>
            rule of Darius, which had been forfeited by their <lb/>
            impiety in acting in opposition to the divine decrees; <lb/>
            moreover, by introducing the ghost of the mighty king, <lb/>
            not only as the stern rebuker of his son's overweening <lb/>
            pride, but also as deprecating in the most emphatic <lb/>
            manner any subsequent invasion of Hellas, we see, in <lb/>
            this early historical drama, an approach to the great <lb/>
            principle of classical dramatic art, which finds its <note type="footnote"> * Bunsen's 'God in History.' Translated by Miss <lb/>

            perfect fulfilment in the Oresteian trilogy, namely, <lb/>
            the final re-establishment of harmony between the <lb/>
            contending powers whose collision has formed the <lb/>
            main action of the drama.</p>
          <p>The Satyric drama, which invariably followed the <lb/>
            trilogy, was a relic of the original dithyrambic chorus <lb/>
            sung at the festival of Dionysos by groups of Satyrs <lb/>
            who followed the chariot of the vintage-god; it was <lb/>
            probably intended to relieve the serious impression <lb/>
            produced by the tragedy, and to furnish amusement to <lb/>
            the populace. It is doubtful whether these Satyric <lb/>
            pieces were ever in such organic connection with the <lb/>
            three dramas which they followed as to justify calling <lb/>
            them a tetralogy; the significance of the " Prometheus," <lb/>
            as the concluding member of ' The Persians,' must <lb/>
            however be admitted. Welcker has shown that we <lb/>
            must distinguish between "Prometheus tho fire- <lb/>
            bringer," and " Prometheus tho fire-kindler;" the <lb/>
            latter being the title of tho Satyric drama in question, <lb/>
            which he maintains had reference to tho establishment <lb/>
            of the Promethen, the torch-race, at Athens, an artisan <lb/>
            festival of which Promethens was regarded as the <lb/>
            founder. The kindling of tho sacred fire might well <lb/>
            be hailed as the symbol not only of victory, but also <lb/>
            of tho brighter day which had just dawned for tho <lb/>
            Hellenic race; while the association of tho poorer <lb/>
            classes, by tho introduction of their favourite festival, <lb/>
            would impart to tho drama a peculiarly popular <lb/>
            character, and render it tho appropriate expression of <lb/>
            tho national enthusiasm.</p><pb n="205"/>

          <p>A fount is theirs of silver; a treasure of their soil.- 240 <note type="footnote"> * It is first in an emphatic passage of the poet Æschylus <lb/>
            that we hear of the silver mines of Laurium, in Attica, and <lb/>
            the valuable produce which they rendered to the state. We <lb/>
            are told by Herodotus that there was in the Athenian trea­ <lb/>
            sury, at the time when Themistoklês made his proposition <lb/>
            to enlarge the naval fore, a great sum arising from the <lb/>
            Laurian mines, out of which a distribution was on the point <lb/>
            of being made among the citizens—ten drachms to each <lb/>
            man. Themistokles availed himself of this precious oppor­ <lb/>

            distribution for the purpose of obtaining an eflicicnt navy.— <lb/>

            And instant all conspicuous were to sight. 400 <lb/>
            First the right wing, well marshall'd, took the lead: <lb/>
            Then their whole naval force in fair array <lb/>
            Bore down against us. All at once was heard <lb/>
            A mighty shout: " Sons of Hellenès, on, <lb/>

            The gods had held for nought, with fervent prayers 500 <lb/>

            When from their frequent orisons the host <lb/>

            cross; <lb/>
            Then those among us who their march began, <lb/>

            Pierced the mid river, warming with his blaze ; <lb/>
            Then each on other fell, and blest was he <lb/>

            Considerable diversity of opinion prevails as to the correct <lb/>
            interpretation of this passage. When it is remembered, <lb/>
            however, that <foreign xml:lang="grc">κόπτομαι</foreign>, med., means to beat the breast in <lb/>

            <title type="sub">INTRODUCTION.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>THE trilogy to which this drama belonged was repre­ <lb/>
            sented B.C. 467, five years after* " The Persians," and <lb/>
            consisted, as we learn from the Didascalia given in the <lb/>
            Medicean manuscript, of Laios, Œdipus, and “The <lb/>
            Seven against Thebes," followed by the Satyric drama <lb/>
            of the Sphinx. It has been appropriately styled the <lb/>
            dramatic epos of the House of Labdacos, for though <lb/>
            the conflicting emotions in the soul of Eteocles are <lb/>
            portrayed with true tragic insight, yet in “The <lb/>
            Seven," as in “The Persians," narrative so far prepon­ <lb/>
            derates over action as to render the treatment of their <lb/>
            respective subjects epic rather than dramatic.</p>
          <p>In this, as in the other dramas of AEschylus, the aim <lb/>
            of the poet is to vindicate the divine government, and <lb/>
            to exhibit the ultimate triumph of order and justice. <lb/>
            The principle more especially emphasized, that of <lb/>
            divine retribution—“ the key-stone of the universal <lb/>
            order "-was embodied by the Greeks in the word <lb/>
            Nemesis: passing from the domain of conscience, it <lb/>
            became in later times a divinity, and has been aptly <lb/>
            characterized by Bunsen as the “Muse of Justice." In <lb/>
            accordance with her teaching, the eternal laws can <note type="footnote"> * Paley. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="264"/>
            never bo violated with impunity: with sleepless <lb/>
            vigilance the dread avenger follows on the track of <lb/>
            crime: for a season, perhaps, no muttering is heard of <lb/>
            the coming storm; but not the less inevitably does <lb/>
            punishment eventually overtake the wrongdoer, or his <lb/>
            posterity. Associated with this inexorable law of <lb/>
            retribution, the poet, in the Theban tragedy, exhibits <lb/>
            the working of those mysterious tendencies to moral <lb/>
            evil which, like hereditary disease, not unfrequently <lb/>
            accompany the fatal heritage of crime, and which, if <lb/>
            not counteracted by the force of personal will, issue in <lb/>
            the final destruction of the sin-polluted race. A brief <lb/>
            outline of the hoary legend, the main features of which <lb/>
            would doubtless be embodied in the first two members <lb/>
            of the trilogy, the Laios and the CEdipus, is essential <lb/>
            for the due appreciation of the concluding drama..</p>
          <p>The crime of Laios may be regarded as the fatal <lb/>
            seed-corn from which he and his descendants reaped a <lb/>
            tear-fraught harvest. This is indicated in the choral <lb/>
            ode of " The Seven against Thebes" (v. 737), which it <lb/>
            has been truly said strikes the key-note of the drama. <lb/>
            Received as a guest into the house of Pelops, he; <lb/>
            according to the legend, carried off Chrysippus, the <lb/>
            son of his host, whoso curse against the ravisher is <lb/>
            subsequently confirmed by Apollo, who thrico warns <lb/>
            him from his sacred shrino to save the State by dying <lb/>
            childless. Heedless of tho divine monition, ho, in on <note type="footnote"> * An interesting exposition of the solar character of the <lb/>

            evil hour, “begat his proper woe, in Œdipus the <lb/>
            parricide " (v. 747).</p>
          <p>Laios, in order to evade the oracle which had <lb/>
            declared that himself would be slain by any son whom <lb/>
            he might beget, caused the infant, as soon as born, to <lb/>
            be exposed on Mount Cithæron, the savage scenery of <lb/>
            which harmonizes with the dark passages of Hellenic <lb/>
            lore with which it is associated. Here he is found by <lb/>
            the herdsmen of Polybos, king of Corinth, who carry <lb/>
            him to their master, by whom he is reared as his own <lb/>
            child. When grown to manhood, doubts having been <lb/>
            cast upon his descent, he repairs to Delphi, in order <lb/>
            to discover the truth as to his parentage. Warned by <lb/>
            the oracle not to return to his country, he proceeds <lb/>
            towards Bœotia, and at the spot called the divided <lb/>
            way, encounters Laios, whom in a skirmish he slays, <lb/>
            not knowing him to be his father. Pursuing his <lb/>
            journey he arrives at Thebes, where, after solving the <lb/>
            riddle of the Sphinx, he obtains the kingdom, and <lb/>
            marries Jocasta, by whom ho becomes the father of <lb/>
            two sons, Eteocles aud Polyneikes, and of two daughters, <lb/>
            Antigone and Ismene. The truth respecting his un­ <lb/>
            happy marriage being at length brought to light, he in <lb/>
            despair puts out his eyes, and resigns the government <lb/>
            to his sons. They, wishing that the family shame <lb/>
            should be concealed from the eyes of men, place him <lb/>
            in confinement, and it is related in one fragment of <lb/>
            the Thebais, that instead of the shoulder of the victims <lb/>
            sacrificed on the altar, they sent him the less honour­ <lb/>
            able portions. This, in his rage, he cast upon the <lb/>
             <pb n="266"/>
            ground, and, at the same time, prayed to the gods that <lb/>
            his sons might perish, each by the hand of the other. <lb/>
            Reference appears to be made to this ancient form of <lb/>
            the tradition in the Seven (v. 787). The brothers, <lb/>
            fearing lest their father's curse should be fulfilled, <lb/>
            make an agreement to reign over the Theban territory <lb/>
            in turn, each for the space of a year. Eteocles, as the <lb/>
            elder, reigns first, and at the appointed time Polyneikes <lb/>
            comes to demand the sceptre, which his brother <lb/>
            refuses to resign. Polyneikes retires to Argos, and <lb/>
            persuades Adrastos, his father-in-law, to assist him to <lb/>
            recover the throne. Accordingly, that prince and fivo <lb/>
            other chiefs, accompanied by Polyneikes, march against <lb/>
            the Cadmeian city. With their appearance before the <lb/>
            walls the third member of the trilogy opens.</p>
          <p>Such, in outline, is the terrible story which ushers <lb/>
            in “The Seven against Thebes." The first tragedy <lb/>
            probably ended with the death of Laios, while the <lb/>
            wrath of CEdipus, and his curse, twice pronounced <lb/>
            against his sons, would doubtless form a principal <lb/>
            feature of the second drama. This wo may infer from <lb/>
            the prominence given to tho curso in the concluding <lb/>
            member of the trilogy.</p>
          <p>I cannot but think, however, that wo should misread <lb/>
            the poet did wo Imagine that the death of the brothers <lb/>
            resulted from the Inevitable operation of their father's <lb/>
            curse. Eteocles, though courageous, is full of in­ <lb/>
            satiablo rage, and instead of yielding to tho pathetic <lb/>
            pleading of the Chorus, exults in the prospect of <lb/>
            fratricide; while Polyneikes is represented as sharing <lb/>
             <pb n="267"/>
            the malignant hatred of his brother (v. 632). Eteocles, <lb/>
            moreover, by retaining the sovereignty, violates the <lb/>
            claims of justice; and Polyneikes, by seeking to <lb/>
            regain it with the assistance of an invading host, is <lb/>
            guilty of impiety towards his country: thus the death <lb/>
            of the brothers, through mutual slaughter, is the <lb/>
            penalty due to their respective wrongdoing, and, as <lb/>
            such, offers no violence to our sense of justice. King <lb/>
            Apollo, it is true, the awful Seventh, is represented as <lb/>
            taking his station at the seventh gate, and avenging <lb/>
            upon the sons of Œdipus the ancient transgression of <lb/>
            Laios; at the same time the poet makes us feel that <lb/>
            they have themselves succumbed to the evil tendencies <lb/>
            inherent in the race, and thus it is that their father's curse <lb/>
            has exercised its dread ascendency over their destiny.</p>
          <p>Had the trilogy terminated with the death of the <lb/>
            brothers such a catastrophe would have violated an <lb/>
            essential canon of classical dramatic art, which requires <lb/>
            the final reconciliation of the principles brought into <lb/>
            collision during the action of the play. These <lb/>
            principles, in the drama before us, are-duty to the <lb/>
            family, and duty to the State; the harmonious action <lb/>
            of which is necessary to the well-being of society. <lb/>
            Thus it would appear that the decree of the senate <lb/>
            respecting the burial of the royal brothers, which has <lb/>
            been regarded as a dramatic blunder on the part of <lb/>
            Æschylus, is in fact essential for bringing about a satis­ <lb/>
            factory dénouement. When, in spite of the prohibition <lb/>
            of the senate, Antigone proclaims her heroic determi­ <lb/>
            nation to inter her brother: she claims our warmest <lb/>
             <pb n="268"/>
            sympathy and admiration : had she stood alone, her <lb/>
            heroism and sisterly affection would have offered a <lb/>
            refreshing relief to the deadly hatred of tho brothers. <lb/>
            The action of the Chorus gives, however, a deeper <lb/>
            significance to the episode. The Chorus, it must be <lb/>
            remembered, represents in the Greek theatre the moral <lb/>
            conscience of the age, in its most elevated form ;* a <lb/>
            character strikingly exemplified in the drama before <lb/>
            us. At the commencement, indeed, they are timid <lb/>
            Theban women, who, vividly realizing the brutal <lb/>
            outrages offered to women after the capture of a <lb/>
            beleaguered city, are possessed by overwhelming fear. <lb/>
            As the drama develops, however, they gradually <lb/>
            assume a loftier tone; the words of expostulation <lb/>
            addressed by them to Eteocles are full of piety and <lb/>
            wisdom: when, therefore, one half of the Chorus <lb/>
            follow, with Antigone, the body of Polyneikes, and <lb/>
            the other half, with Ismene, that of Eteocles, wo may <lb/>
            understand that the poet intended thus to recognise the <lb/>
            equal sacredness of the principles respectively repre­ <lb/>
            sented by the sisters, namely, allegiance to the holy tio <lb/>
            of kindred-blood, and fealty to the State-the object, <lb/>
            in Greek civilization, of tho most ardent patriotism.</p>
          <p>The great Theban trilogy, as remarked by Bunsen, <lb/>
            begins and ends with deeds of horror ; but as the last <lb/>
            and heaviest judgment is executed, gracious images of <lb/>
            the future surround the bodies of tho slain ; tho devoted <lb/>
            heroism displayed by the Theban women " is a living <lb/>
            pledge for the moral order &lt; f the world,” and offers a <note type="footnote"> * <unclear>Hega</unclear>! </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="269"/>
            spectacle commensurate in grandeur with the darker <lb/>
            features of the drama.</p>
          <p>Very interesting is the protest thus offered by the pro­ <lb/>
            phet-bard of antiquity against that want of respect for <lb/>
            women, and that jealousy of their participation in the <lb/>
            functions of men, which find such frequent expression <lb/>
            in Greek literature, and which are embodied in the <lb/>
            insolent language addressed by Eteocles to the Chorus <lb/>
            at the commencement of the drama (v. 169).</p>
          <p>Such examples as that of the Theban women may <lb/>
            have inspired the wise utterance of Plato, who declares <lb/>
            that for the legislator to leave women without educa­ <lb/>
            tion, and without sufficient scope for their energies, is <lb/>
            materially to cripple the power of the State.*</p>
          <p>With regard to the political bearing of the drama, <lb/>
            K. 0. Müller remarks that Æschylus strove to <lb/>
            moderate the restless struggles of his countrymen <lb/>
            after democracy and dominion over other Greeks. <lb/>
            The description of the upright Amphiaraus, who <lb/>
            wished not to seem, but to be the best; the wise general <lb/>
            from whose mind, as from the deep furrows of a well­ <lb/>
            ploughed field, noble counsels proceed, was universally <lb/>
            applied by the Athenian people to Aristeides, and was <lb/>
            doubtless intended by AEschylus for him. In conclu­ <lb/>
            sion, I may allude to the passage in the Iliad which <lb/>
            relates how, when the invading army reached Asôpos' <lb/>
            banks, Tydeus was sent forward to Thebes to speak <lb/>
            the common message of the host. Admitted into the <lb/>
            palace of Etcocles, undaunted though alone, he <note type="footnote"> * Laws, vii. 805. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="270"/>
            challenged the Cadmeians to combat, and, through <lb/>
            Athena's aid, came off victorious. Whereupon the <lb/>
            Cadmeians sought to compass his returning steps, and <lb/>
            planted an ambush of fifty warriors; these Tydeus <lb/>
            slew, one only being left to bear the tidings homeward.</p>
          <p>This treachery on the part of the Cadmeians <lb/>
            furnishes a motive for the impetuous eagerness <lb/>
            manifested by Tydeus to advance to the attack: it may <lb/>
            also throw light upon the iron-hearted purpose of the <lb/>
            infuriated chiefs, which found expression in their <lb/>
            terrible oath­ <lb/>
            " the town to raze, <lb/>
            And ravage the Cadmcian's citadel, <lb/>

            Of either sex, oh hear us, nor betray <lb/>
            A city toiling 'neath the spear, <note type="footnote"> * Our poet cannot have mistaken the names borne by the <lb/>
            gates of Thebes in his own day; but two of them, Oncan <lb/>
            and Borrhæan, differ from the names as given by Pausanias <lb/>
            some four centuries later. Pausanias has the four names, <lb/>
            Proitid, Electran, Neïtan and Homoloid, in common with <lb/>
            Æschylus; but besides, he has the Ogygian, the Crenæan, <lb/>
            and the Hypistai (supreme), or gates of Supreme Jupiter, <lb/>
            who had a temple near them. Æschylus informs us that <lb/>
            Athena had a temple near the Oncan gates; probably she <lb/>
            was hence locally entitled Oncan Athena. Oncan was thought <lb/>
            to be a Phœnician epithet introduced into Thebes by <lb/>
            Cadmos. We can only guess that they were the gates <lb/>
            called Ogygian (ancient) in the time of Pausanias. Onca, as <lb/>
            a Hebrew word, cannot be confidently interpreted; but it <lb/>
            may belong to the same root as Anak, a celebrated family <lb/>
            of giants. Æschylus does not name the seventh gate, which <lb/>
            may have been the Hypistan. It is quite possible that <lb/>
            Borrhæan (or Borrho ian, in some editions) meant simply the <lb/>
            north gate, and was a se condary appellation. We have <lb/>

            Where for the young to die is glorious. <lb/>
            Of him, I thus am ordered to proclaim. <lb/>

            For him this just requital is decreed ;— <lb/>
            No rearing of the mound by pious hands, <lb/>

          <p>286. The abrupt <foreign xml:lang="grc">τί γένωμαι</foreign>; cannot be right. I make <lb/>
            no doubt that the poet's syntax was continuous; whether <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">στείχουσι στεΦανωταί</foreign>, or, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ποτὶ πύργου .... στείχουσι <lb/>
            στεΦάνωμα</foreign>, as in Soph. Antig., or again, <foreign xml:lang="grc">στεγάνωμα</foreign>, the <lb/>
            roof.</p>
          <p>338. <foreign xml:lang="grc">κορκορυγαὶ δ' ἀν'ἂστυ, ποτὶ πόλιν δ</foreign>' | <foreign xml:lang="grc">άρκάνα πυρ­ <lb/>
            γω̑τις</foreign>, should be responded to by <foreign xml:lang="grc">παντοδαπὸς δὲ καρπὸς <lb/>
            χαμάδις πεσὼν</foreign> I <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀλγύνει κυρήσας</foreign>. First, I make little doubt <lb/>
            that <foreign xml:lang="grc">ποτὶ πολιν</foreign> should be <foreign xml:lang="grc">ποτιπίλναται</foreign> (approaches) which <lb/>
            answers all the conditions of the case. Next, the Cretic <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὁρκάνα</foreign> convicts the Molossus <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀλγύνει</foreign> as false. <foreign xml:lang="grc">Πυργω̑τις</foreign> is <lb/>
            wrong both in metre and in sense. <foreign xml:lang="grc">Όρκάνα</foreign> must be the net­ <lb/>
            rope, by which victors swept the streets and squares, and <lb/>
            caught runaways. It seems to be alluded to in Iliad, v. 487, <lb/>
            where it has the epithet <foreign xml:lang="grc">πάναγρος</foreign>, which in the tragic poets <lb/>
            may be <foreign xml:lang="grc">παντᾰγρος</foreign>, or here, perhaps, <foreign xml:lang="grc">παντᾰγρευ̑τις</foreign>.</p>
          <p>In 356—3G4 Hermann has rightly discerned, that the <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">νύκτερον τέλος</foreign> does not mean death, but violation of the <lb/>
            person; that <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐλπίς</foreign> means apprehension, fear, and that <foreign xml:lang="grc">εὐνὰν</foreign> <lb/>
            has been inserted by some one who did not understand the <lb/>
            word <foreign xml:lang="grc">τέλος</foreign> aright. For <foreign xml:lang="grc">τλήμονες εὐνὰν</foreign> Hermann has <foreign xml:lang="grc">τλη̑̕̕μον <lb/>
            αἷσιν</foreign>: but it seems to me that we rather need (writing <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐκ <lb/>
            τυχόντος</foreign>, " any random man," for <foreign xml:lang="grc">εὐτυχου̑ντος</foreign>)— <pb n="324"/>
            <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BELL_22_fig18.jpg"/></figure> <lb/>
              Here <foreign xml:lang="grc">αἰχμάλωτον</foreign> must agree with <foreign xml:lang="grc">τέλος</foreign>—rather harsh ; and <lb/>
              <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπίῤῥοθον</foreign> expresses, that this is a new misery superadded— <lb/>
              an after-clap. I have changed the singulars, <foreign xml:lang="grc">δυσμενου̑̕̕̕ς, <lb/>
              ὑπερτέρου</foreign>, into plurals.</p>
          <p>781. <foreign xml:lang="grc">κρεισσοτέκνων</foreign> is clearly absurd, <foreign xml:lang="grc">μισοτέκνων</foreign> a highly <lb/>
            probable correction.</p>
          <p>728. It is incredible that the poet should have written <lb/>

          <p>THE combat between the Titans and the Olympian <lb/>
            Gods, issuing in the triumph of the latter, constitutes, <lb/>
            as Hegel remarks, the central fact of Hellenic my­ <lb/>
            thology. This hoary legend may be regarded as <lb/>
            symbolizing in the physical universe the emergence of <lb/>
            order out of chaos, while in the history of religious <lb/>
            thought it marks a period of transition, characterized <lb/>
            mainly by the metamorphosis of the nature-powers, the <lb/>
            objects of men's earlier worship, into the humanized <lb/>
            divinities of Hellas, involving the recognized supremacy <lb/>
            of the higher over the lower elements of being.</p>
          <p>One phase of this struggle is treated by AEschylus <lb/>
            in the drama of the Eumenides; there the hoary god­ <lb/>
            desses, the dark vengeance-powers of the primeval <lb/>
            world, are brought into harmonious subordination to <lb/>
            Pallas Athena, the impersonation of the wisdom and <lb/>
            benignity of Zeus. Another aspect of the conflict <lb/>
            formed the subject of the Promethean trilogy, which set <lb/>
            forth the relation between the finite and the supreme <lb/>
            will, in their antagonism and their reconciliation.</p>
          <p>Among the grand ideals bequeathed to the world by <lb/>
            Hellenic genius there is none, perhaps, which has more <lb/>
            deeply impressed the poetic imagination than the much­ <lb/>
             <pb n="328"/>
            enduring Titan; none, certainly, which has for a longer <lb/>
            period coloured the stream of philosophic thought. <lb/>
            The Promethean myth, it must be remembered, was <lb/>
            not the invention of either Hesiod or Æschylus; its <lb/>
            root, as Bunsen remarks, is older than the Hellenes <lb/>
            themselves. Even at the present day, the legend, in <lb/>
            its rudest form, may be traced among the Iranian tribes <lb/>
            of the Caucasus, while in our western world it has in­ <lb/>
            spired the genius of more than one great poet of modern <lb/>
            times.</p>
          <p>The three dramas of which the trilogy consisted arc <lb/>
            believed to have been “ Prometheus, the Fire-bringer,” <lb/>
            " Prometheus Bound," and " Prometheus Unbound," of <lb/>
            which the second has alone survived.- Prometheus <lb/>
            there appears as the champion and benefactor of mail­ <lb/>
            kind, whose condition, at the close of the Titanic age, <lb/>
            is depicted as weak and miserable in the extreme : <lb/>
            “Seeing, they saw in vain ; <lb/>
            Hearing, they heard not; but like shapes in dream?, <lb/>
            Through the long time all things at random mixed.”</p>
          <p>Zeus, it is said, proposed to annihilate these puny <lb/>
            ephemerals, and to plant upon the earth a new race in <lb/>
            their stead. Prometheus represents himself as having <lb/>
            frustrated this design, and as being consequently sub­ <lb/>
            jected, for tho sake of mortals, to the most agonising <lb/>
            pain, inflicted by the remorseless cruelty of Zens. We <note type="footnote"> * Grippo has, I think, satisfactorily refuted the plausible <lb/>
            hypothesis of Hermann, that the " Prometheus Unbound " <lb/>
            was composed prior to, and independently of, the " Pro­ <lb/>
            metheus Bouud." </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="329"/>
            have thus the Titan, the symbol of finite reason and <lb/>
            free will, depicted as the sublime philanthropist, while <lb/>
            Zeus, the supreme deity of Hellas, is portrayed as the <lb/>
            cruel and obdurate despot, a character peculiarly re­ <lb/>
            volting to Athenian sentiment.</p>
          <p>The attempt to explain this apparent anomaly has <lb/>
            given rise to a variety of theories and speculations. It <lb/>
            is urged by some that at the time of Æschylus so sharp <lb/>
            a line was drawn, in the minds of educated men, between <lb/>
            religion and mythology, that the latter was accepted <lb/>
            simply as poetical imagery, and was employed by the <lb/>
            poet without any definite moral aim. Others imagine, <lb/>
            with Welcker, that Æschylus, as a contemporary of <lb/>
            Zenophanes, and one initiated into the Eleusinian <lb/>
            mysteries, maintained an antagonistic attitude towards <lb/>
            the traditional creed, and that in the Promethean trilogy <lb/>
            he seized the opportunity to enter his protest against it, <lb/>
            by representing the head of the Olympian system under <lb/>
            so revolting an aspect. It must be remembered, how­ <lb/>
            ever, that the Athenian drama formed part of a solemn <lb/>
            religious festival, celebrated by the entire population, <lb/>
            and that the popular theology was intertwined with the <lb/>
            national and political life not only of Athens, but of <lb/>
            Hellas. The magnificent statues of Pallas Athena <lb/>
            and of Olympian Zeus, executed at enormous cost by <lb/>
            Phidias, the contemporary of Æschylus, were doubtless <lb/>
            regarded by the multitudes assembled at the national <lb/>
            festivals as symbols of divine and very awful realities; <lb/>
            and if we turn to the remaining dramas of the poet we <lb/>
            find his delineation of these divinities in harmony with <lb/>
             <pb n="330"/>
            this conception. Zeus, more especially, is represented <lb/>
            as uniting in himself the sublimest attributes of deity.</p>
          <p>The Chorus, in their solemn invocation (Ag. 160), <lb/>
            lay peculiar stress upon the name of Zeus, as the <lb/>
            supreme deity, the prime source of consolation and of <lb/>
            wisdom. He is elsewhere portrayed as the almighty <lb/>
            ruler (Sup. 795), who by ancient law directs destiny <lb/>
            (Sup. 655), and without whose will nothing is accom­ <lb/>
            plished for mortals (Sup. 804). He is invoked as king <lb/>
            of kings, most blest among the blest, of powers on high <lb/>
            most perfect power (Sup. 519). He is likewise apo­ <lb/>
            strophised as father, creator, king, supreme artificer, <lb/>
            wielding no delegated sway, and whose deed is prompt <lb/>
            as his word to execute the designs of his deep-coun­ <lb/>
            selling mind (Sup. 587). He is the all-seeing father <lb/>
            (Sup. 130); lord of ceaseless ages (Sup. 567); the <lb/>
            guardian of the guest (Ag. 353); the punisher of over­ <lb/>
            weening pride (Per. 822); the upholder of tho righteous <lb/>
            law of retribution (Ag. 154). Many more passages of <lb/>
            a similar character might bo adduced, from which it <lb/>
            would appear that the poet, though not emancipated <lb/>
            from the errors and limitations of Polytheism, had, <lb/>
            nevertheless, risen to the sublime ideal of one supremo <lb/>
            ruler, whose righteous will was identified with tho <lb/>
            eternal decrees of destiny. Instead of placing himself <lb/>
            in antagonism with tho popular religion, ho seems <lb/>
            rather, as the prophet of Polytheism, to havo striven to <lb/>
            elevate the popular conception of Zeus, and of tho other <lb/>
            Hellenie divinities, more especially Apollo and Pallas <lb/>
            Athena, who are represented in tho Oresteia as tho <lb/>
             <pb n="331"/>
            willing but subordinate executors of their father's will. <lb/>
            It seems improbable that in the Promethean trilogy <lb/>
            alone he should assume an attitude towards the popular <lb/>
            religion utterly irreconcilable with the tendencies <lb/>
            manifested in his remaining works; the apparent con­ <lb/>
            tradiction has doubtless arisen from the loss of the <lb/>
            concluding drama. I agree with those critics who <lb/>
            think that if we possessed it we should see the majesty <lb/>
            of Zeus fully vindicated, and reconciliation established <lb/>
            between the contending powers.</p>
          <p>As it seems unreasonable to accept, without quali­ <lb/>
            fication, the gross picture of Zeus as represented, in the <lb/>
            extant drama, by his exasperated adversary, Prometheus, <lb/>
            so we must look elsewhere for the true ground of the <lb/>
            antagonism subsisting between him and the Olympian <lb/>
            divinities, all of whom are arrayed against him. <lb/>
            Though the Promethean myth, as related by Plato, in <lb/>
            the “ Protagoras," differs in many essential features <lb/>
            from the version of Æschylus, yet the fundamental <lb/>
            thought there embodied is so completely in harmony <lb/>
            with the teaching of the prophet-bard, that it may be <lb/>
            referred to as, perhaps, throwing light upon the moral <lb/>
            significance of the trilogy. In the “ Protagoras " a <lb/>
            distinction is drawn between the wisdom which minis­ <lb/>
            ters to physical well-being, and political wisdom which <lb/>
            enables men to live in organized communities. Pro­ <lb/>
            metheus is represented as having endowed men with <lb/>
            the former, but as unable to invest them with the <lb/>
            latter, which involved the exercise of justice, and was <lb/>
            under the special guardianship of Zeus. Now it is this <lb/>
             <pb n="332"/>
            quality of justice which was bestowed upon mortals by <lb/>
            Zeus that Æschylus extols with peculiar emphasis. <lb/>
            "Riches," he says, "afford no bulwark to him who <lb/>
            spurns the mighty altar of justice" (Ag. 381); firm <lb/>
            based is justice (Cho. 635) ; " all must perish who <lb/>
            withstand her mandates" (Cho. 630). Justice is styled <lb/>
            the .daughter of Zeus (Cho. 934); reverence for her <lb/>
            altar is characterized as the sum of wisdom (Eum. <lb/>
            510).</p>
          <p>It was, moreover, an idea familiar to the Æschylean <lb/>
            age that all excellence was the gift of the gods, more <lb/>
            especially of Zeus, and that it could not be obtained <lb/>
            without their intervention. " God alone is good," sang <lb/>
            Simonides ; “ no one wins virtue without tho aid of <lb/>
            the gods, neither a state nor an individual." " Zeus, <lb/>
            the great virtues attend upon mortals from thee," sang <lb/>
            Pindar ; “ and,” he adds, " prosperity lives longer with <lb/>
            those who revere thee, but with perverse minds it docs <lb/>
            not equally abide, thriving for all time" (Isthm. Odo iii.) <lb/>
            “ Through the favour of God man blooms with a <lb/>
            wise heart."* " An untainted mind," according to <lb/>
            Æschylus, is “ heaven's first gift." The Chorus remind <lb/>
            Prometheus of “ the dreamlike feebleness that fetters <lb/>
            the blind race of mortals " (Pro. 55G); an expression <lb/>
            which recalls Pindar's description of meu as “ tho <lb/>
            dream of a shadow;” “yet,” he adds, " when splendour <lb/>
            given by the god comes to them, a brilliant light falls <lb/>
            upon men and a sweet life " (Pyth. Ode viii. Epode 5). <lb/>
            Not only was Prometheus unablo to endow mortals <note type="footnote"> * These passages are cited by <unclear>Schocmann</unclear>. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="333"/>
            with these higher attributes; by conferring upon them <lb/>
            benefits contrary to the will of Zeus, he, in fact, <lb/>
            alienated them from the gods, in fellowship with whom, <lb/>
            according to the Greek ideal, men found their highest <lb/>
            well-being.</p>
          <p>He may thus be regarded as personifying that in­ <lb/>
            surgent condition of the will which, blind to the per­ <lb/>
            ception of higher truth, is full of arrogant self-con­ <lb/>
            fidence and all-defying pride. In many respects he <lb/>
            offers a parallel to Milton's Satan, " a creation requiring <lb/>
            in its author almost the spiritual energy with which he <lb/>
            invests the fallen Seraph." The Titan chained to his <lb/>
            solitary rock, and the archangel prone upon the lake of <lb/>
            fire, stand alone, the one in ancient, the other in modern <lb/>
            literature, as stupendous examples of indomitable will; <lb/>
            of both it may be said with truth that, " what chains us, <lb/>
            as with a resistless spell, in such a character, is <lb/>
            spiritual might made visible by the racking pains which <lb/>
            it overpowers."*</p>
          <p>For the Titan, however, there is deliverance, and <lb/>
            the. extant fragments of the concluding member of the <lb/>
            trilogy enable us to form some idea as to the agency <lb/>
            by which it was accomplished. At the opening of the <lb/>
            " Prometheus Unbound " the Titan was seen brought <lb/>
            once more to light, after the lapse of ages, from the <lb/>
            abyss into which he had been hurled at the conclusion <lb/>
            of the “ Prometheus Bound." He was still chained to <lb/>
            the rock, with the additional torment of the eagle, <lb/>
            which daily preyed upon his liver. The punishments <note type="footnote"> * Channing. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="334"/>
            of the Titans, like the Titanic powers themselves, re­ <lb/>
            present the absence of rule or measure; the restless <lb/>
            insatiability of the lower passions and desires when, <lb/>
            with self-asserting insolence, they bid defiance to the <lb/>
            restraints of law. Under his prolonged torment the <lb/>
            spirit of Prometheus is somewhat subdued ; this change <lb/>
            he himself prophesies in the previous drama (Pro. 520), <lb/>
            where he says— <lb/>
            " By myriad pangs and woes <lb/>
            Bowed down, thus shall I 'scape these bonds.”</p>
          <p>Wo are here reminded of the poet's utterances respect­ <lb/>
            ing the discipline of suffering, which afford a clue to <lb/>
            the significance of this feature of the legend­ <lb/>
            " To sober thought Zeus paves the way, <lb/>
            And wisdom links with pain. <lb/>
            Against their will <lb/>
            Rebellious men are tutored to be wise.”—(Ag. 170.) <lb/>
            " Well-earned is wisdom at the cost of pain.”-(Eum. 499.)</p>
          <p>The Chorus consisted of the twelve Titans, six male <lb/>
            and six female personages, who, redeemed from Tar­ <lb/>
            taros, visibly represent one of the two worlds whose <lb/>
            strife and reconciliation formed the subject of tho <lb/>
            trilogy. The elementary forces of nature, personified <lb/>
            as gods, must bo defeated in order to assure dominion <lb/>
            to a more spiritual order of divinities; but when tho <lb/>
            triumph of mind has been assured, tho once rebellious <lb/>
            nature-powers reappear, as beneficent but subordinate <lb/>
            agents.* <note type="footnote"> * <unclear>Hegel</unclear> </note> <pb n="335"/>
            </p>
          <p>They open the drama with an ode in which they <lb/>
            describe the journey they have taken in order to pay <lb/>
            Prometheus a visit of sympathy.</p>
          <p>In the well-known fragment translated by Cicero, <lb/>
            Prometheus, in return, narrates his sufferings, describes <lb/>
            the torment he endures from the eagle, and longs for <lb/>
            death as the goal of his anguish.</p>
          <p>Herakles* next appears upon the scene, and in him <lb/>
            Prometheus recognizes his heaven-appointed deliverer. <lb/>
            Nowhere are the noble and the repulsive features of <lb/>
            Hellenic mythology more remarkably associated than <lb/>
            in the numerous legends which gather round the person <lb/>
            of Herakles. The fundamental idea embodied in this <lb/>
            Zeus-born hero is, however, that of irresistible power, <lb/>
            " whose action is as beneficent to the children of men as <lb/>
            it is fatal to the enemies of light." The heroic deeds <lb/>
            of Herakles are glorified by Pindar (Nem. i. 33, 34, <lb/>
            62-72), who also appeals to them as authenticating his <lb/>
            divine vocation ; while, according to the rhetorician <lb/>
            Aristides, he was styled by men their saviour, the <lb/>
            averter of evil. Nowhere, however, is he introduced in <lb/>
            this character more significantly than as the liberator <lb/>
            of Prometheus.</p>
          <p>According to Hellenic mythology,† Herakles closed <lb/>
            the line of heroes, the earth-born sons of Zeus, whose <lb/>
            mission it was to ennoble and elevate the human race. <lb/>
            He therefore exhibited the highest result of the fellow­ <note type="footnote"> * An interesting analysis of the significance of the story <lb/>
            of Herakles will be found in Cox's Mythology of the Aryan <lb/>
            Nations.” † Schoemann. </note> <lb/>

            ship of Zens with mortals, of which Io was one of the <lb/>
            first recipients. Hence the significance of her appear­ <lb/>
            ance in the " Prometheus Bound." She, like the Titan, <lb/>
            resisted the divine will, and, like him, must stiffer the <lb/>
            penalty of her rebellion; accordingly the account of <lb/>
            her sufferings, as, wailing and distraught, she pursues <lb/>
            her toilsome wanderings, serves to heighten the impres­ <lb/>
            sion of the cruel tyranny of Zeus, which it is the object <lb/>
            of that drama to produce.</p>
          <p>In “ The Suppliants," however, Zeus appears in rela­ <lb/>
            tion to Io, not as the obdurate tyrant, but as the <lb/>
            beneficent deity, whose severest judgments issue in <lb/>
            blessings to the individual and to mankind. Doubtless, <lb/>
            under this aspect he would have been represented in the <lb/>
            third member of the Promethean trilogy.</p>
          <p>Hcrakles inquires from Prometheus his way to the <lb/>
            gardens of the Hesperides; the Titan, in reply, de­ <lb/>
            scribes his journey thither, and announces the dangers <lb/>
            which he will have to encounter. Forthwith the eaglo <lb/>
            appears, winging its flight towards Prometheus : <lb/>
            Herakles utters tho exclamation, “ Archer Apollo, <lb/>
            surely guide mine arrow,” draws his bow, and slays tho <lb/>
            pest.</p>
          <p>In what manner tho subsequent liberation of Pro­ <lb/>
            metheus was effected wo have no means of determining ; <lb/>
            whether Herakles himself unloosed his chains, or <lb/>
            whether this was accomplished through the intervention <lb/>
            of Hermes, or some other divinity; whether Herakles <lb/>
            prevailed upon Zens to accept <unclear>Cheire11</unclear> as a substitute <lb/>
            for Prometheus, and whether Cheiron voluntarily <lb/>
             <pb n="337"/>
            descended into Hades; and, finally, whether the Gods <lb/>
            appeared upon the seene, to celebrate, with Prometheus <lb/>
            and the Titans, the nuptials of Peleus and Thetis- <lb/>
            these are questions to which neither the fragments <lb/>
            themselves, nor the testimony of other witnesses, <lb/>
            enable us to return a satisfactory answer, and I conse­ <lb/>
            quently abstain from entering upon them.</p>
          <p>The chief interest, however, centres in the mind of <lb/>
            Prometheus, and upon the agency by which the areh­ <lb/>
            rebel was transformed into the willing subject and <lb/>
            minister of Zeus. The spectacle of his brother and <lb/>
            sister Titans and Titan esses redeemed from durance <lb/>
            would tend to correct the false impression which had <lb/>
            possessed his mind respecting the ruthless tyranny of <lb/>
            Zeus, and consequently the gnawing desire to witness <lb/>
            his humiliation would give place to the unreluctant re­ <lb/>
            cognition of his supremacy. He would accordingly <lb/>
            no longer refuse to reveal the secret, upon the disclo­ <lb/>
            sure of which he, in his blindness, imagined the main­ <lb/>
            tenance of that supremacy to depend.* In Hesiod <lb/>
            Zeus is represented as allowing himself to be apparently <lb/>
            deceived by Prometheus, when he taught men to bring <lb/>
            worthless offerings to the Gods; the Titan there ap­ <lb/>
            pears as the trickster caught at last in his own wiles. <lb/>
            That the reign of Zeus, whom the poet elsewhere <lb/>
            extols as " The Lord of ceaseless ages," " Most blessed <lb/>
            among the blest," should be conceived of by him as <lb/>
            contingent upon the word of Prometheus, seems to me <lb/>
            incredible. The voluntary revelation of his supposed <note type="footnote"> * This view is expounded at greater length by Schoemann. </note> <note type="footnote"> z </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="338"/>
            secret was the token that the all-defying rebel was <lb/>
            transformed into the willing subject and minister of <lb/>
            Zeus.</p>
          <p>It is related * that Zeus, when he released Prome­ <lb/>
            theus from his chains, required him, as a slight volun­ <lb/>
            tary punishment, to bind his head with branches of the <lb/>
            agnus-eastus (<foreign xml:lang="grc">λύγος</foreign>), a plant frequently employed <lb/>
            for religious purposes.</p>
          <p>The same symbolic signification was, in after times, <lb/>
            attached to the ring of Prometheus, referred to by <lb/>
            Catullus and Pliny. The former relates that when <lb/>
            Prometheus appeared at the marriage festival of Peleus <lb/>
            and Thetis, he wore a ring, as a slight token of his <lb/>
            ancient punishment: <lb/>
            " Extenuata gerens veteris vestigia pœnæ; t <lb/>
            Quam quondam silici restrictus membra catena <lb/>
            Persolvit, pendens c verticibus præruptis.”</p>
          <p>Not as an ornament, says Pliny (xxxiii. 4), has <lb/>
            Prometheus worn the iron ring. but as a chain ; and <lb/>
            (xxxvii. 1), as a slight token of punishment, a piece of <lb/>
            the rock to which he had been fastened was inserted in <lb/>
            the ring instead of a gem.</p>
          <p>Tho iron finger-ring is not. like tho lugos-crown, <lb/>
            expressly referred back to Æschylus; tho same signi­ <lb/>
            fication, however, attaches to both, and it is not probable, <note type="footnote"> * As his authority for this statement, Welcker refers to <lb/>
            Athenæus and Menodotus. </note><note type="footnote"> ‡ This and the following references arc quote l from <lb/>
            Welcker. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="339"/>
            as Welcker remarks, that they should not have been <lb/>
            associated in the ancient legend.</p>
          <p>Thus the dignity of man, of whom Prometheus may <lb/>
            be regarded as the representative, is fully vindicated, <lb/>
            when, instead of rebelling against the restraints of law, <lb/>
            he joyfully accepts them, and finds his true liberty in <lb/>
            obedience; thenceforth the crown, the token of sub­ <lb/>
            mission, is transformed into an honourable adornment, <lb/>
            and the iron ring becomes the symbol of a holy con­ <lb/>
            secration.*</p>
          <p>Thus we may imagine was brought about the re­ <lb/>
            conciliation of the powers whose antagonism formed <lb/>
            the subject of the “ Prometheus Bound." We cannot but <lb/>
            admire the marvellous art with which the poet, while <lb/>
            making his personages the representatives of certain ab­ <lb/>
            stract principles, at the same time endows them with life <lb/>
            and sharply-defined individuality. This impression of <lb/>
            reality is heightened in Prometheus by the allusion of <lb/>
            the Chorus to his marriage with their sister Hesione. <lb/>
            The chorus of colossal Titans, delivered at length from <lb/>
            their mighty toils, and assisting at the deliverance of <lb/>
            Prometheus, seems to me one of the grandest conceptions <lb/>
            that ever entered a poet's mind. It harmonizes with <lb/>
            the Æschylean conception of Zeus, as head of the <lb/>
            Olympian hierarchy, reigning supreme in the domain <lb/>
            of nature and of mind.</p>
          <p>In concluding this very inadequate study of a great <lb/>
            subject, I will allude, in a few words, to the theory <lb/>
            propounded by Professor Kuhn, with reference to the <note type="footnote"> * Welcker. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="340"/>
            Promethean myth.* He considers the name of the <lb/>
            Titan to be derived from the Sanscrit word Pramantha, <lb/>
            the instrument used for kindling fire. The root mand, <lb/>
            or manth, implies rotatory motion, and the word <lb/>
            manthami, used to denote the process of fire-kindling, <lb/>
            acquired the secondary sense of snatching away ; hence <lb/>
            we find another word of the same stock, pramatha, signi­ <lb/>
            fying theft.</p>
          <p>The word manthami passed into the Greek language, <lb/>
            and became the verb manthanô, to learn; that is to say <lb/>
            to appropriate knowledge ; whence prometheia, fore­ <lb/>
            knowledge, forethought. Prometheus, the fire-bringer, <lb/>
            is the Pramantha personified, and finds his prototype <lb/>
            in the Aryan Matarisvan, a divine or semi-divino per­ <lb/>
            sonage, closely associated with Agni, the fire-god of <lb/>
            the Vedas. We have thus another curious instance of <lb/>
            the common elements which may be detected in the <lb/>
            Vedic and Hellenic mythology, while the development <lb/>
            of the Promethean myth affords an instructive illustra­ <lb/>
            tion of the mode in which words, originally having <lb/>
            reference to natural phenomena, gradually became <lb/>
            invested with new and more spiritual significance when <lb/>
            transplanted to the soil of Hellas. <note type="footnote"> * An epitome of Professor Kuhn's work, entitled “Die <lb/>

            But strove in vain ; for they, in stubborn souls <lb/>
            Of crafty wiles disdainful, thought by force, <lb/>
            An easy task, the mastery to gain. <lb/>
            But me, not once but oft, my mother Themis, <lb/>
            And Earth (one shape with many names) had told <lb/>
            Prophetic, how the future should be wrought. <lb/>
            That not by strength of thew or hardiment 220 <lb/>
            Should mastery be compassed, but by guile; <lb/>
            But when this lore I did expound in words, <lb/>
            They deigned me not a single look ; whereon, <lb/>
            Of courses free to choose, the wisest seemed <lb/>

            From me the tyrant of the gods received, 230 <lb/>
            And hath requited with these base returns. <lb/>

            When seated on his father's throne, forthwith, <lb/>
            He to the several gods was dealing out <lb/>
            Their several honours, marshalling his realm; <lb/>
            But he of toil-worn mortals took no count; <lb/>
            The race entire he ardently desired 240 <lb/>
            To quench, and plant a new one in its stead. <lb/>
            And none but I opposed his purposes ; <lb/>
            I dared alone;—I saved the mortal race <lb/>

            From sinking blasted down to Hades' gloom. <lb/>

          <p>I see, Prometheus, and would fain to thee, <lb/>
            All subtle as thou art, best counsel give; <lb/>
            Know thine own self, thy manners mould anew, <lb/>
            For new the monarch who now rules the gods ; <lb/>
            But if thou thus harsh, keenly-whetted words <lb/>

            Mayhap may hear thee, so the pangs which now <lb/>
            His wrath inflicts but childish sport may seem. <lb/>
            But come, 0 much enduring, quell thy rage; <lb/>
            Seek thou releasement from these miseries; <lb/>
            Stale may appear to thee the words I speak; <lb/>
            Yet such the penalty that waits, Prometheus, <lb/>
            On a too haughty tongue; But thou, e'en now <lb/>

            Who now holds sway, accountable to none. <lb/>

            The pillars on his shoulders beareth up <lb/>
            Of heaven and earth ; burthen of painful grasp. <lb/>
            So. in Cilician caves with ruth I saw <lb/>

            Their earth-born tenant, hostile prodigy, 360 <lb/>
            The hundred-headed, eurb'd by violence; <lb/>
            Raging Typhôeus, all the gods who braved, <lb/>
            Hissing out slaughter from his horrid jaws. <lb/>
            Forth from his eyeballs flash'd a hideous glare, <lb/>
            As though by force the reign of heaven to storm. <lb/>
            But on him fell the sleepless dart of Zeus, <lb/>
            The thunder-bolt down-rushing, breathing flame, <lb/>
            Which him from his high-worded boasting hurl'd <lb/>
            Prostrate; for, smitten to his inmost reins, <lb/>
            With strength burnt out, he lightning-blasted fell. 370 <lb/>
            And now his frame, helpless and sprawling lies <lb/>
            Hard by the salt-sea narrows, sorely prest <lb/>
            Beneath the roots of Ætna. Seated there, <lb/>
            Upon the topmost peaks, Hephæstos smites <lb/>
            The molten masses, whence one day shall burst <lb/>
            Torrents of fire, devouring with fierce jaws <lb/>
            The level fields of fruitful Sicily. <lb/>
            Such rage Typhôeus shall anew belch forth <lb/>
            With scorching missiles of fire-breathing storm <lb/>
            Insatiate; by the fierce bolt of Zeus so <lb/>
            Blasted, but unconsum'd. No tiro thou, <lb/>
            Nor dost my teaching need. Save thou thyself <lb/>
            As best thou knowest how. But be assured <lb/>

            Professor Newman conjectures that this gold-flowing stream <lb/>
            was the Ural. The gold of the Ural mountains is still cele­ <lb/>

            theories of the earliest Greeks, this condition was fulfilled by <lb/>
            the Indus. Arrian (vi. 1) mentions that Alexander the <lb/>
            Great, when preparing to sail down the Indus (having seen <lb/>
            crocodiles in the river Indus, and in no other river except the <lb/>
            Nile ... ), seemed to himself to have discovered the sources <lb/>
            of the Nile; as though the Nile, rising from some place in <lb/>
            India, and flowing through much desert land, and thereby <lb/>
            losing its name Indus, next .... flowed through inhabited <lb/>
            land, being now called Nile by the Ethiopians of those parts, <lb/>
            and afterwards by the Egyptians. Virgil, in the 4th <lb/>

          <p>INTRODUCTION.</p>
          <p>THE trilogy to which this drama belonged, like that of <lb/>
            which " The Seven against Thebes" formed the con­ <lb/>
            cluding member, was founded upon an ancient epic, by <lb/>
            an unknown author. Of this poem little is known, <lb/>
            except that it contained five thousand five hundred <lb/>
            verses, and bore the title of " The Danaides."</p>
          <p>The story which it embodied appealed powerfully to <lb/>
            that passion for legendary genealogies which formed <lb/>
            such a striking feature of the Grecian character. <lb/>
            Alleged descent from a common ancestor was the bond <lb/>
            of union between the members of every Grecian com­ <lb/>
            munity, great or small; and as this legendary personage <lb/>
            was usually of divine or semi-divine origin, even the <lb/>
            humblest citizen thus felt himself brought into more <lb/>
            or less direct filiation with the gods. The divine <lb/>
            element thus, according to the popular conception, <lb/>
            incarnated in humanity, culminated in the great <lb/>
            national hero, Herakles, " the most renowned and <lb/>
            ubiquitous of all the semi-divine personages worshipped <lb/>
            by the Hellenes "-the only mortal who, from a life <lb/>
            of toil and suffering on earth, was admitted to the god­ <lb/>
            head, and received into the society of Olympos. His <lb/>
             <pb n="396"/>
            descendants, moreover, the Herakleids, associated with <lb/>
            the Dorians in the conquest of the Peloponnesus, were <lb/>
            glorified in the popular imagination as the founders of <lb/>
            the great Dorian cities of Argos, Sparta, and Messenia, <lb/>
            and as the introducers in those localities of a new <lb/>
            social order. Peculiar interest thus attaches to Io, the <lb/>
            progenitrix of Herakles, and to the birth of her off­ <lb/>
            spring, Epaphos, an event celebrated in such glowing <lb/>
            strains by the chorus of Suppliants (v. 580).*</p>
          <p>In thus veiling the grosser features of the Io legend, as <lb/>
            popularly conceived, while, at the same time, investing <lb/>
            it with a more spiritual meaning, Æsehylus appears <lb/>
            not only as the great creative poet, but also as tho <lb/>
            true prophet of his generation. The numerous legends <lb/>
            of which the story of Io may be regarded as a typical <lb/>
            example embodied, in a vulgar form, tho idea that it <lb/>
            was only through association with the divino principle <lb/>
            that man could rise to his true ideal as man. Tho <lb/>
            poet seizes upon this idea, separates it from the grosser <lb/>
            elements of the popular symbol, and extols the benignity <lb/>
            of Zeus in thus seeking fellowship with mortals—giving <lb/>
            prominence to the idea that through this agency alone <lb/>
            the human race was raised to a higher level, physical <lb/>
            and moral, than it could otherwise havo attained.</p>
          <p>Tho introductory character of " Tho Suppliants" <lb/>
            has been inferred from tho extreme simplicity of the <lb/>
            plot, and from other considerations; accordingly, it is <note type="footnote"> * I have not alluded to the solar character of the Hellenic <lb/>
            legends—a subject upon which so much light has been <lb/>
            thrown by Professor Max Müller and Mr. Cox. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="397"/>
            now generally regarded as forming the first member of <lb/>
            a trilogy of which the succeeding dramas were " The <lb/>
            Egyptians," and " The Danaides," both of which have <lb/>
            been lost. Though deficient in dramatic interest, this <lb/>
            piece is characterized by the remarkable beauty of the <lb/>
            choral odes, which, from their sublime simplicity, and <lb/>
            from the high conception which they embody of Zeus, <lb/>
            as the supreme and omnipotent ruler, remind us occa­ <lb/>
            sionally of the Hebrew psalms.</p>
          <p>It must be remembered, moreover, that, at the time <lb/>
            of Æschylus, the national legends had not yet lost their <lb/>
            hold upon the popular belief, and accordingly mythical <lb/>
            events, such as the arrival of the Danaides in Argos, <lb/>
            were considered not only as having influenced the <lb/>
            subsequent destinies of Greece, but also as having been <lb/>
            brought about by the inscrutable counsels of Zeus; <lb/>
            the unfolding of whose designs, through the medium of <lb/>
            tragedy, was regarded as the highest function of the <lb/>
            poet.</p>
          <p>The ancient legend tells of the strife between the <lb/>
            sons of Belos ; how Danaos was driven from his home <lb/>
            by Ægyptos, who usurped his throne; how the <lb/>
            latter sought to force the Danaides to marry his <lb/>
            sons, and how Athena herself exhorted Danaos to <lb/>
            flee with his daughters to the land of Io.</p>
          <p>The introductory drama opens with their arrival, in <lb/>
            the character of suppliants, at Argos, and is founded <lb/>
            upon the protection accorded to them by the Argives <lb/>
            and their king, Pelasgos: the appearance of the <lb/>
            Egyptian herald, at the conclusion of the play, toge­ <lb/>
             <pb n="398"/>
            ther with his forcible attempt to carry off the suppliants, <lb/>
            prepares the spectator for the arrival of the Egyptian <lb/>
            pursuers in the succeeding drama. Attention has been <lb/>
            called to the picturesque beauty of the opening scene, <lb/>
            where, holding in their bands their wool-wreathed <lb/>
            myrtle boughs, and arrayed in white apparel, which <lb/>
            formed a striking contrast to their swarthy limbs, the <lb/>
            suppliants grouped themselves under the statues of the <lb/>
            gods : they would, moreover, be regarded with peculiar <lb/>
            interest as wanderers from tho valley of the Nile, " the <lb/>
            wondrous river fed with snow," upon whose fountains <lb/>
            no human eye had been permitted to gaze.</p>
          <p>Of " The Egyptians," unfortunately, no fragments <lb/>
            remain; it doubtless embodied the main incident in <lb/>
            the tragic story of the Danaides. It is related in the <lb/>
            legend that Danaos was elected king by the Argivcs, <lb/>
            in place of Pelasgos; being unable to cope with <lb/>
            Ægyptos and his sons, who still press their suit, ho is <lb/>
            compelled to yield to their demand, and promises to <lb/>
            give his daughters in marriage to their detested suitors. <lb/>
            In secret, however, he furnishes each with a dagger, <lb/>
            enjoining her, at the same time, to slay her lord during <lb/>
            the nuptial night. The terrible deed was executed. <lb/>
            Hypermnestra alone, soothed by love, and preferring <lb/>
            tho reputation of cowardice to that of blood-guiltiness <lb/>
            (Pro. 887), spared Lyneeus, tho partner of her couch. <lb/>
            Here one duty could not be observed without violating <lb/>
            another, and thus was brought about that collision <lb/>
            between two primary principles of human nature, the <lb/>
            reconciliation of which constitutes the essence of the <lb/>
             <pb n="399"/>
            Æschylean drama. The remark of Grote with reference <lb/>
            to this feature of Grecian tragedy will be perused with <lb/>
            interest: " The tragedian," he says, " not only appeals <lb/>
            more powerfully to the ethical sentiments than poetry <lb/>
            had ever done before, but also, by raising these grave <lb/>
            and touching questions, addresses a stimulus and chal­ <lb/>
            lenge to the intellect, spurring it on to ethical specu­ <lb/>
            lation."</p>
          <p>From the Hellenic point of view, Hypermnestra was <lb/>
            regarded as a criminal, while the bloody deed of her <lb/>
            sisters was extolled as an act of heroism, enjoined not <lb/>
            only by their father, but by the gods themselves.</p>
          <p>The suitors, moreover, are represented from the first <lb/>
            as in the highest degree insolent and overbearing: <lb/>
            barbarians, they had dared to invade the sacred soil of <lb/>
            Hellas, and the vengeance which had overtaken them <lb/>
            would ally itself in the popular imagination with the <lb/>
            destruction of the Oriental hosts which had so recently <lb/>
            crowned the grand contemporary conflict between Persia <lb/>
            and Hellas. This feeling would be heightened by the <lb/>
            war between Egypt and Athens, which began B.C. 462.</p>
          <p>The trial of Hypermnestra most probably formed the <lb/>
            principal subject of " The Danaides," the concluding <lb/>
            member of the trilogy. From a fragment of the pro­ <lb/>
            logue which has been preserved, we learn that the <lb/>
            drama opened with the hymn with which it was cus­ <lb/>
            tomary to awaken the newly-married pair : <lb/>
            " Since now arises the bright lamp of day, <lb/>
            The bridegrooms I awake with friendly lay, <lb/>
            Chanted by choral bands of youths and maids."</p><pb n="400"/>
            
          <p>The horrors of the bridal night would thus be <lb/>
            revealed, together with what was regarded as the <lb/>
            treacherous clemency of Hypermnestra. According to <lb/>
            the ancient story, she was cast by her father into prison, <lb/>
            and subsequently brought to trial before a court with <lb/>
            the constitution of which we are not acquainted. <lb/>
            The goddess Aphrodite herself appears to plead her <lb/>
            cause, reminding us of the trial of Orestes before the <lb/>
            court of Areopagus, when Pallas Athena, as president, <lb/>
            gave her casting vote in his favour.</p>
          <p>One fragment from the address of Aphrodite has been <lb/>
            preserved: <lb/>
            " Longs the pure sky to blend with Earth, and Love <lb/>
            Doth Earth impel to yield to his embrace; <lb/>
            The rain-shower, falling from the slumberous heaven, <lb/>
            Kisses the Earth; and Earth brings forth for mortals <lb/>
            Pasture for sheep-flocks and Demeter's grain. <lb/>
            The woods in spring their dewy nuptials hold; <lb/>
            And of all these I am in part the cause."</p>
          <p>Hypermnestra was acquitted, and from her union <lb/>
            with Lynceus sprang in course of time the demigod <lb/>
            Herakles. The remaining daughters of Danaos were <lb/>
            purified from the stain of blood by Athena aud Hermes, <lb/>
            or, according to another form of the legend, by Zeus <lb/>
            himself.</p><pb n="401"/>

            was <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀνθονόμου τα̑ς</foreign>.Parson changed it to <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀνθονομούσας</foreign>, <lb/>
            which is not plausible to me.</p>
          <p>52. The old text <foreign xml:lang="grc">τά τε νυ̑ν</foreign>, should, I think, be <foreign xml:lang="grc">γενετα̑ν</foreign>, <lb/>
            which completes the splendid conjectural corrections of <lb/>
            Hermann and others, who change <foreign xml:lang="grc">τεκμήρια τάτ</foreign>’ <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀνόμοι</foreign>’ <foreign xml:lang="grc">οἷδ</foreign>’ <lb/>
            to <foreign xml:lang="grc">τεκμήρἰ, ἄγαιονόμοισιν</foreign>. This one example may justly <lb/>
            incite us in nonsensical passages to conjecture boldly.</p>
          <p>62. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀπὸ χώρων ποταμω̑ν τ</foreign>’is certainly wrong. A very <lb/>
            simple correction will be <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀπὸχόρτων ποταμῶν τ</foreign>’, from her <lb/>
             <pb n="453"/>
            feeding-places and streams, or eveu from her crofts and <lb/>
            streams. In Pindar we find <foreign xml:lang="grc">χόρτος λέοντος</foreign> : in Eur. Iph. T. <lb/>
            134, <foreign xml:lang="grc">χόρτων εὐδένδρων</foreign>. (Hermann's <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀπὸχλωρῶν πετάλω <lb/>
            ἐγρομένα</foreign> is audacity out of place.)</p>
          <p>70. If <foreign xml:lang="grc">δειμαίνουσα</foreign> be right, we have to join <foreign xml:lang="grc">εἴτις</foreign> with <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">γόεδνα</foreign> ... in the sense of “ I lament whether," which is cer­ <lb/>
            tainly unnatural. Dindorf prints <foreign xml:lang="grc">δεῖμα μένουσα</foreign>, I suppose <lb/>
            merely to show what the metre requires.</p>
          <p>78. For the old reading <foreign xml:lang="grc">βωμὸς</foreign> ’ʹ<foreign xml:lang="grc">Αρης φύγασιν</foreign>, which is <lb/>
            certainly wrong, an obvious correction is <foreign xml:lang="grc">βωμὸς ἀρειφύγασιν</foreign>, <lb/>
            which would be unexceptionable if we found it in the text. <lb/>
            But other possibilities occur: thus the poet may have <lb/>
            written ’<foreign xml:lang="grc">Αρησφύγετον</foreign> in imitation of the word <foreign xml:lang="grc">Κρησφύγετον</foreign>.</p>
          <p>80. <foreign xml:lang="grc">Εἰ θείη Διὸς εὖ παναληθῶς</foreign>! This is nonsense. To <lb/>
            change <foreign xml:lang="grc">Διὸς</foreign> to <foreign xml:lang="grc">θεὸς</foreign> has no plausibility ; all remains abrupt; <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">θεὸς</foreign> followed by <foreign xml:lang="grc">Διὸς</foreign> is scarcely possible. My present belief <lb/>
            is that we get the poet's sense by ’<foreign xml:lang="grc">Ιθεία Διὸς ἐν παναληθεῖ</foreign> <lb/>
            .... which means, " In the straight line of Jove, though <lb/>
            drawn with perfect accuracy, the heart's desire of Jove is not <lb/>
            easy to trace." Then the abruptness vanishes and the argu­ <lb/>
            ment is solid. Moreover, in the next line <foreign xml:lang="grc">τοι</foreign> seems to <lb/>
            introduce a general maxim. This suggests to me that <foreign xml:lang="grc">πἁντᾱ</foreign>, <lb/>
            which is weak, ought to be <foreign xml:lang="grc">βροντά</foreign>.</p>
          <p>93. <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὰν ἄποινον</foreign> (the old text) is manifestly indefensible. <lb/>
            Critics do not seem to have observed that in place of it we <lb/>
            need the accusative after <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐξέπραξεν</foreign>. Then we must put <lb/>
            a full-stop after <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐξοπλίζει</foreign>, and the sense needed will be <lb/>
            given by <foreign xml:lang="grc">Πάντα νόον δαιμονίων</foreign> | <foreign xml:lang="grc">μνῆμον ἄνω φρόνημά πως</foreign> <lb/>
            | <foreign xml:lang="grc">αἀτόθεν ἐξέπραξεν</foreign>...</p>
          <p>104. The little word <foreign xml:lang="grc">καὶ</foreign> offends me, and suggests that <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">καὶ διάνοιαν</foreign> should possibly be <foreign xml:lang="grc">παιδὸς ἄνοιαν</foreign>. Is the spondee <lb/>
            in the third foot satisfactory ?</p>
          <p>107. Remove the stop and join <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐμπρεπῆ</foreign> with <foreign xml:lang="grc">με</foreign>.</p>
          <p>115, 116. <foreign xml:lang="grc">πελομένων καλῶς</foreign> I <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπιδρομῶς ὅθι θάνατος</foreign> any. <lb/>
            This is mere chaos. The general sense needed is, that <lb/>
             <pb n="454"/>
            "incestuous marriages involve the gods in guilt:" <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐναγέα</foreign> <lb/>
            must be the predicate. I propose to change <foreign xml:lang="grc">πελομένων</foreign> to <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">πελοι ἀν οὐ</foreign>, which gives the sense excellently. On com­ <lb/>
            paring the strophe, it seems likely that v. 116 contains <lb/>
            epithets of <foreign xml:lang="grc">τελεα</foreign>, as v. 105 of <foreign xml:lang="grc">μέλεα</foreign>. To read for v. 116 <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπίδρομα</foreign>, lIda, <foreign xml:lang="grc">θανατοσαγῆ</foreign>, would be very close to the <lb/>
            letters; but I think <foreign xml:lang="grc">θανατοσαπῆ</foreign>, " laden with death," mere <lb/>
            likely, and it is but r for <foreign xml:lang="grc">Π</foreign>. ’<foreign xml:lang="grc">Επίδρομα</foreign> I render invasive.</p>
          <p>118, 119. Punctuate with comma after <foreign xml:lang="grc">πόνοι</foreign>, and with <lb/>
            full-stop after <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀπάξει</foreign>, and interpret, " The distresses are <lb/>
            indefinable, into what the wave is to carry us;" that is, <lb/>
            “It is doubtful, into what ”</p>
          <p>127. I do not think that <foreign xml:lang="grc">δόμος δορὸς</foreign> can mean a house of <lb/>
            timber, as Scholefield seems to join it, but <foreign xml:lang="grc">δορὸς</foreign> perhaps <lb/>
            ought to be <foreign xml:lang="grc">δοραῖς</foreign> hides.</p>
          <p>203-206, of Scholefield, but 207-10, of the Oxford pocket <lb/>
            edition, seem to be out of order. The first two lines should <lb/>
            change places, and the fourth should be first.</p>
          <p>244. <foreign xml:lang="grc">τηρὸν</foreign> is difficult to justify and difficult to condemn ; <lb/>
            but I think <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἰερόραβδον</foreign> to be a fair and satisfactory correction <lb/>
            of <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἰεροῦ ῤάβδον</foreign>.</p>
          <p>309. It seems impossible that <foreign xml:lang="grc">ῤυσίων</foreign> can be correct. <lb/>
            1 suggest <foreign xml:lang="grc">ψαυσέων</foreign>, strokings, caresses, equivalent to <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπαφη­ <lb/>
            σέων</foreign>. The next line, which is lost, may have becu <foreign xml:lang="grc">τίς οὐν <lb/>
            ἐς</foreign> ’ʹ<foreign xml:lang="grc">Επαφον</foreign> (or <foreign xml:lang="grc">τίς</foreign> ô<foreign xml:lang="grc">ῆτα κείνῳ</foreign>) <foreign xml:lang="grc">κλεινὸν ἀναφέρει γένος</foreign>.</p>
          <p>394. <foreign xml:lang="grc">μὴ τοῑον</foreign>, for unlucky, evil, is not plausible. <foreign xml:lang="grc">μὴ <lb/>
            τερπνὸν</foreign> may suggest itself; but there are too many other <lb/>
            possibilities. I conjecture <foreign xml:lang="grc">μεμπτέον</foreign>.</p>
          <p>485. For the unmeaning <foreign xml:lang="grc">εὐ ῤέοντα</foreign> I suggest <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐγκ ρέογτα</foreign>, <lb/>
            equivalent to <foreign xml:lang="grc">ασιλεύαντα</foreign>.</p>
          <p>488. <foreign xml:lang="grc">πολισσούχων</foreign>all regard as wrongly repeated from the <lb/>
            preceding liue. One may suggest <foreign xml:lang="grc">πολυλλίστους</foreign>, or <foreign xml:lang="grc">πολυ­ <lb/>
            ξείνους ε̃δρας</foreign>. Paley's <foreign xml:lang="grc">περιστυλους</foreign> is also good.</p><pb n="455"/>
            
          <p>492. The old <foreign xml:lang="grc">φόβον</foreign> seems to me quite right, and the <lb/>
            change to <foreign xml:lang="grc">φόνοῦ</foreign> needless. " Beware lest too much confidence <lb/>
            produce alarm."</p>
          <p>510. Perhaps <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὔτι</foreign> should be <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὔ σε</foreign>, as the sense seems to <lb/>
            require.</p>
          <p>521. <foreign xml:lang="grc">πιθοῦ τε καὶ γενέσθω</foreign>. Obviously to me <foreign xml:lang="grc">γενέσθω</foreign> has <lb/>
            supplanted some epithet of <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀνδρῶν</foreign>. The nearest word that <lb/>
            I think of is <foreign xml:lang="grc">πανεχθῶν</foreign>. This is in itself irreprovable: <foreign xml:lang="grc">πιθοῦ <lb/>
            τε, καὶ πανεχθῶν</foreign> I <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἄλευσον ἀνδρῶν ὕβριν</foreign>.</p>
          <p>528. <foreign xml:lang="grc">γενοῦ πολυμνήστωρ</foreign> cannot be right. Dindorf prints <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">πολυμνῆστορ</foreign> metri causâ, I suppose, rightly regarding <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὕβριν</foreign> <lb/>
            as a pyrrhic in the strophe. Apparently for <foreign xml:lang="grc">πολυμνήστωρ</foreign> <lb/>
            we need an accusative epithet of <foreign xml:lang="grc">αἶνον</foreign>, and for <foreign xml:lang="grc">γενοῦ</foreign> a geni­ <lb/>
            tive or dative, such as <foreign xml:lang="grc">γόνου</foreign> or <foreign xml:lang="grc">γονῇ</foreign> (not <foreign xml:lang="grc">γένους</foreign>, for that <lb/>
            occurs twice besides in the sentence). I doubtfully propose <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">νέωσον εὄφρον</foreign>’ <foreign xml:lang="grc">αἶνον</foreign> I <foreign xml:lang="grc">γόνου πολύμνηστον</foreign>. In the next line, <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">τοι</foreign> must be either interpreted <foreign xml:lang="grc">σοὶ</foreign>, I suppose, or changed into <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">σοί</foreign>.’ʹ<foreign xml:lang="grc">Ενοικοι</foreign> seems to be for the prosaic <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἔποικοι</foreign>, settlers.</p>
          <p>550. <foreign xml:lang="grc">εἰσικνουμένου</foreign>, after <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἰκνεῖται</foreign>, is hardly credible. Din­ <lb/>
            dorf's <foreign xml:lang="grc">εἰσικνουμένη</foreign> does not remove this objection. Hermann's <lb/>
            conjecture <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐγκεχριμένη</foreign> seems to me quite justified.</p>
          <p>555. Surely <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὕδωρ τὸ Νείλου</foreign> ought to be <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὕδωρ τε Νείλου</foreign>. <lb/>
            The poet says that the wind of the desert (<foreign xml:lang="grc">τυφῶ μένος</foreign>) and <lb/>
            the water of Nile come upon the snow-fed fields of Egypt. <lb/>
            Like Herodotus, he supposed that snow, melting in the <lb/>
            highlands of Abyssinia, kept the Nile full through the <lb/>
            summer.</p>
          <p>558. <foreign xml:lang="grc">θείας</foreign> is clearly wrong, yet it is hard to believe <foreign xml:lang="grc">θυιὰς</foreign> <lb/>
            right. My last thought is <foreign xml:lang="grc">δαλὴς ζαθέαισον</foreign>.</p>
          <p>572. I do not see how <foreign xml:lang="grc">βία</foreign> can be nominative to <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀποστάζει</foreign>. <lb/>
            Io must be nominative to <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀποστάζει</foreign>, therefore <foreign xml:lang="grc">βία</foreign> is corrupt. <lb/>
            I conjecture [<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἠ δ</foreign>’ <foreign xml:lang="grc">αἰκίσματος αἰνοῦ</foreign>] <foreign xml:lang="grc">Διός</foreign> r' <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀπημάντῳ κ.τ.λ</foreign>.</p>
          <p>574. I protest against rendering <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἕρμα</foreign>, ballast, as an utter <lb/>
            monstrosity, and suggest that it means gem, germ. Compare <lb/>
            Iliad, iv. 177, and <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἕρματα</foreign> for gems, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἕρμος</foreign>, a necklace.</p><pb n="456"/>
            
          <p>580. The logic of <foreign xml:lang="grc">τίς γὰρ</foreign> proves that the previous lines <lb/>
            assert the progeny to have been Jupiter's; hence Z<foreign xml:lang="grc">ηνὸς</foreign> must <lb/>
            be predicate, and <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸ δὴ</foreign> cannot possibly be right. I propose <lb/>
            to change it to <foreign xml:lang="grc">τόδε</foreign>.</p>
          <p>628. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀρότοις ἐνἄλλοις</foreign> implies that aporos in a literal sense <lb/>
            has been named in the previous lines: I think, therefore, <lb/>
            that <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἄχορον</foreign> has somehow come in place of the word <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἄροτος</foreign>. <lb/>
            In the antistrophe, for <foreign xml:lang="grc">πράκτορά τε σκόπον</foreign>, which is certainly <lb/>
            wrong, I would suggest <foreign xml:lang="grc">πράκτορ</foreign>’ <foreign xml:lang="grc">αὐτόσκοπον</foreign>.</p>
          <p>672. Paley well changes <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὼς</foreign> to <foreign xml:lang="grc">γᾶς</foreign>.</p>
          <p>674. I like the Aldine reading <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπιβώμαν</foreign> better than <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπὶ <lb/>
            βωμῶν</foreign> or <foreign xml:lang="grc">βωμοῖς</foreign>. We probably all adopt <foreign xml:lang="grc">μοῦσαν θείατ</foreign>, <lb/>
            with Ahrens and Hermann, for <foreign xml:lang="grc">μοῦσαι θεαί τε</foreign>.</p>
          <p>678-680. The common text is certainly wrong; yet it <lb/>
            may be corrected in more ways than one. For <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸ πτολιν <lb/>
            κρατύναι</foreign> I wish <foreign xml:lang="grc">καὶ πολιν κρατύνοι</foreign>, which explains syntax <lb/>
            and sentiment, so as to open the poet's meaning, probably, <lb/>
            thus : <foreign xml:lang="grc">φυλάσσοι τ</foreign>’ <foreign xml:lang="grc">αἰσίμοισι τιμὰς</foreign> I <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸ δήμιον καὶ πόλιν <lb/>
            κρατύνοι</foreign> I <foreign xml:lang="grc">προμαθίαις ξυνόμητις ἀρχά</foreign>. This is the poet's <lb/>
            ideal of a well-tempered free state. " Let the folk reserve <lb/>
            honours (public offices) for the virtuous, and let a magistracy <lb/>
            of common counsel stablish the city by previous delibera­ <lb/>
            tions." <foreign xml:lang="grc">Προμάθιαι</foreign> is poetical for <foreign xml:lang="grc">προβουλεύματα</foreign>. For <foreign xml:lang="grc">αἰσί­ <lb/>
            μοισι</foreign> the old text has <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀτιμίας</foreign>, which is manifestly wrong.</p>
          <p>775. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀπρόσδεικτος</foreign>, a rock that cannot be pointed at"! <lb/>
            Rather, I think, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀπρόσμικτος</foreign>, inaccessible.</p>
          <p>786. <foreign xml:lang="grc">τίν</foreign>’ <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀμφ</foreign>’ <foreign xml:lang="grc">αὐτᾶς ἔτι πόρον</foreign> I <foreign xml:lang="grc">τέμνω γάμου καί λυτήρια</foreign>. <lb/>
            This chaos would be desperate, only that the metre of the <lb/>
            strophe guides us. (Dindorf there changes <foreign xml:lang="grc">καρδίας</foreign> to <foreign xml:lang="grc">κάρζας</foreign>, <lb/>
            quite causelessly.) I see nothing for it but audacious con­ <lb/>
            jecture, thus: <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐλθέτω μόρος πρὸ κοί</foreign> I <foreign xml:lang="grc">τας γαμηλίου, τυχὼν</foreign> <lb/>
            | <foreign xml:lang="grc">τᾶνδ</foreign>’ <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὑφᾶν, τελεσφόρον</foreign> \ <foreign xml:lang="grc">δεμνίων γάμου καλίπτραν</foreign>. | Here <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">τᾶνδ</foreign>’ <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὑφᾶν</foreign> is the <foreign xml:lang="grc">σάργαναι</foreign> of v. 768, and <foreign xml:lang="grc">καλίπτραν</foreign> is <lb/>
            accusative in opposition to the sentence, as in Ag. 218, where <lb/>
            we supply <foreign xml:lang="grc">λέγω</foreign> with <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀρωγιίν</foreign>.</p><pb n="457"/>
            
          <p>979. <foreign xml:lang="grc">κἄλωρα κωλύουσαν ὡ μένειν</foreign> epM, is confessedly non­ <lb/>
            sense. The first word is corrected to <foreign xml:lang="grc">κἄωρα</foreign>, rather (I think) <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">κἄνωρα</foreign>, since Herodotus has <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἄνωρος</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀνωρία. ῎Ανωρα</foreign>, <lb/>
            as less usual than <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἄωρα</foreign>, might get corrupted. Further, <lb/>
            I suggest, <foreign xml:lang="grc">κἄνωρα</foreign> [or <foreign xml:lang="grc">καὶ χλωρὰ</foreign>] <foreign xml:lang="grc">κωλύουσ</foreign>’ <foreign xml:lang="grc">κωλύουσα σα̑ μένειν <lb/>
            ἐρᾷ</foreign> : that is, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐρᾷ</foreign> (<foreign xml:lang="grc">φιλει</foreign>) <foreign xml:lang="grc">κωλύουσα</foreign>, “ she loves to hinder the <lb/>
            unripe from abiding safe."</p>
          <p>983. For <foreign xml:lang="grc">μὴ πάθωμεν</foreign> I think we need <foreign xml:lang="grc">μὴ λαθώμεθ</foreign>’ (" let <lb/>
            us notforget”), unless a whole line is lost after <foreign xml:lang="grc">δορί</foreign>.</p>
