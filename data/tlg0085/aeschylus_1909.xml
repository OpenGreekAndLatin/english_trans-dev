          <p>THE object of these prose translations is to enable those <lb/>
            who know some Greek to read the Greek of Æschylus <lb/>
            correctly. They have never dreamed of pretending to any <lb/>
            value in artistic form. No prose, however well it might be <lb/>
            used, could ever represent such verse aesthetically; only <lb/>
            verse can do that; and so long as verse affords the means <lb/>
            of doing it, to seek the same end with a less effective instru- <lb/>
            ment I have always looked upon as a mistaken aim. Prose <lb/>
            has a proper function of its own, a separate and different <lb/>
            one-to show how the Greek is to be construed. It is <lb/>
            superior for that purpose, and should be content, I think, <lb/>
            if it can achieve it without more offence than necessary. <lb/>
            The true spirit and effect are only in the power of verse <lb/>
            to give; but verse itself is not in a position to convey <lb/>
            them until first it understands the meaning of the poet's <lb/>
            words; and it is in that preliminary business of explaining <lb/>
            that a prose version has its legitimate and useful province. <lb/>
            Whether the text has been restored correctly, and the 'sense <lb/>
            of it correctly rendered,-those are the two points on which <lb/>
            a prose translation of a poem should be judged.</p>
          <p>The numbering of lines adopted in this translation is that <lb/>
            of Wecklein (1885), who counts them as they appear in the <lb/>
            Medicean MS. (known as M). Wecklein's is the best text <lb/>
            for a scholar, but Weil's (Teubner) is good for ordinary <note type="footnote"> v </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="VI"/>
            purposes. I have been careful to give the readings that <lb/>
            differ from those of Wecklein and Well. Many of these <lb/>
            readings have been found since their editions, which <lb/>
            represent the light of twenty years ago, were published; <lb/>
            and I hope it will be thought that the last twenty years <lb/>
            have done much both for the text and the interpreta- <lb/>
            tion of Æschylus. Whenever they are likely to be un- <lb/>
            familiar, the readings adopted are given in the margin; <lb/>
            and references to the Classical Review, which scholars <lb/>
            can easily consult, have often enabled me to dispense <lb/>
            with arguments in favour of them: but in a book of <lb/>
            this kind it was not convenient, and did not seem <lb/>
            necessary, always to record the names of their discoverers. <lb/>
            Wecklein's Appendices give a complete record up to <lb/>
            1893; and in the case of anything more recent, the <lb/>
            author's name, when it is not my own, is mentioned.</p>
          <p>It may be of service to students to add that the diction <lb/>
            of The Persians is different from that of the other plays of <lb/>
            Æschylus. The characters are Persians, the scene is laid <lb/>
            in their chief city, and the whole play reflects the manners <lb/>
            and ideas of the East. To suit the local colour, the language <lb/>
            has an appropriate cast. Æschylus makes his Persians <lb/>
            speak in an archaic-sounding Ionic style, the Greek of Asia. <lb/>
            This effect is obtained partly by metre, eg. the use of long <lb/>
            trochaics; partly by forms of words and pronunciation (as <lb/>
            veos <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐὼν νεὰ φρονεῖ, κυάνεον, εὐπέτεος, νεώς</foreign>) ; partly also by <lb/>
            forms of phrase. A similar effect was sought long afterwards <lb/>
            by Timotheus, as we can now observe in his recently dis- <lb/>
            covered dithyramb, the <foreign xml:lang="grc">Πέρσαι</foreign>. There, describing the <lb/>
            battle of Salamis, he puts broken Asiatic Greek into the <lb/>
            mouth of a Persian.</p>

          <p>*** In this volume the following plays: Agamemnon, <lb/>
            Choephoroe, Eumenides, Prometheus Bound, and The Sup- <lb/>
            Pliants, were translated by Dr Walter Headlam, and have <lb/>
            been already published separately. The versions of The <lb/>
            Persians and The Seven against Thebes are not from his <lb/>
            hand, but the translator has been aided in the interpretation <lb/>
            of various passages by notes which he left. The text used <lb/>
            is that of Wecklein (1885). In a certain number of places <lb/>
            other readings have been adopted, either due to Walter <lb/>
            Headlam or known to have been approved by him. These, <lb/>
            with the exception of some differences in punctuation, will <lb/>
            be found indicated in the margin. In one or two lines of <lb/>
            The Seven against Thebes where the text is corrupt, but not <lb/>
            yet satisfactorily emended, a provisional reading, noted as <lb/>
            such in the margin, has been adopted for the purpose of this <lb/>
            translation.</p>

          <p>ÆSCHYLUS, son of Euphorion, was the eldest of the <lb/>
            three great dramatists of Greece, Æschylus, Sophocles, <lb/>
            Euripides. By them the drama was developed from <lb/>
            its early beginnings to the delicate, perhaps over- <lb/>
            elaborated, art and semi-modern touch displayed in <lb/>
            Euripides. He was born in B.C. 525 at Eleusis in <lb/>
            Attica, and died at Gela in Sicily in the year B.C. 456. <lb/>
            The recorded facts of his life are few, and even for these <lb/>
            the authority is often doubtful. For example, the <lb/>
            reason for his going to Sicily-which he had probably <lb/>
            visited earlier in his life at the invitation of Hiero, <lb/>
            Tyrant of Syracuse-is variously narrated. In the <lb/>
            annual contests between the tragic poets, which at <lb/>
            Athens were recognised and regulated by the State, <lb/>
            his first success was obtained in B.C. 485. In 472 he <lb/>
            won the prize with the trilogy of which The Persians <lb/>
            was one, and again in 477 with The Seven against <lb/>
            Thebes.</p>
          <p>In the history of the Grecian drama, a striking <lb/>
            contribution on what may be termed the mechanical <lb/>
            side was made by Æschylus, and proved of far- <lb/>
            reaching importance. Whereas in tragedy hitherto <lb/>
            there had been only one actor and the chorus, he, by <lb/>
            introducing a second actor, immensely extended the <note type="footnote"> xi </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="XII"/>
            scope and opportunity for presenting dramatic situa- <lb/>
            tions to an audience. Seven plays remain to us as <lb/>
            monuments of his genius. In these there is observ- <lb/>
            able a growth and progress in dramatic power, to <lb/>
            which two principal causes may be noted as con- <lb/>
            tributory. Just as in England the Reformation, on <lb/>
            the one hand, gave a stimulus to character and <lb/>
            intellect, whilst on the other hand the discovery of <lb/>
            the New World kindled the imagination by tales of <lb/>
            . voyages, or of lands favoured by Nature and rich in <lb/>
            ancient wealth ; to which causes the great outburst <lb/>
            of literature in the era of Elizabeth was largely due; <lb/>
            so the heroic struggle of Greece against the aggressive <lb/>
            power of Persia must have deeply influenced the <lb/>
            imagination of the rising poet. The battle of <lb/>
            Marathon, in which Æschylus fought, and the defeat <lb/>
            of the Persian fleet, are reflected in the vivid descrip- <lb/>
            tion in The Persians of the sea-fight at Salamis ; and <lb/>
            were likely to produce that drama, separated only by a <lb/>
            few years from The Persians, The Seven against Thebes, <lb/>
            which represents a combat to the death of heroes,1 <lb/>
            and is justly characterised by Aristophanes as <foreign xml:lang="grc">δρᾶμα <lb/>
            ῎Αρεως μεστόν</foreign>, " a play crammed with the pomp of <lb/>
            war." The hardships, again, of the soldier on active <lb/>
            service are described in the Agamemnon with a direct- <lb/>
            ness which comes from experience of the realities of <lb/>
            a campaign. <note type="footnote"> 1 The Seven against Thebes is more a pageant of war than a play, <lb/>
            and it seems probable that it was written before The Persians. The <lb/>
            contrast of character given in the latter play by the introduction of <lb/>
            Dareios, and the fine imaginative stroke by which the play is made to <lb/>
            open from the Persian point of view, are already indications of the <lb/>
            dramatic power which culminated in the great trilogy of the Agamemnon. </note> <pb n="XIII"/>
            </p>
          <p>The second principal stimulus was, in the case of <lb/>
            Æschylus, the contact of a mind naturally of a <lb/>
            religious bent with the ideas and doctrines of the <lb/>
            East. The Ionian cities in Asia Minor were channels <lb/>
            for the communication of such ideas, and there was <lb/>
            in addition, at Eleusis, the birthplace of Æschylus, <lb/>
            a ceremonial worship of Demeter and Persephone, <lb/>
            embodied in the famous Eleusinian Mysteries. With <lb/>
            this cult of the Mother and Daughter, which had <lb/>
            been one of the great recipients in Greece of new <lb/>
            sacred rites borrowed from Egypt1 and connected <lb/>
            with the worship of Isis, the family of Æschylus were, <lb/>
            according to tradition, officially associated. The <lb/>
            acquaintance shown by Æschylus in The Persians with <lb/>
            the distinctively Persian doctrines and philosophic <lb/>
            view of Nature, as opposed to ideas elsewhere pre- <lb/>
            vailing in the East, would of itself indicate a far more <lb/>
            than superficial study of Oriental modes of thought.</p>
          <p>From these considerations we may realise to some <lb/>
            extent the mental equipment with which Æschylus <lb/>
            came prepared to deal as a dramatist with the <lb/>
            great problems which, under many diverse shapes, <lb/>
            interest mankind. In the Prometheus Bound the <lb/>
            conflict between the Titanic benefactor of mankind <lb/>
            and offended Heaven is shown only at one stage. <lb/>
            The dramatic grandeur of the scenes in which <lb/>
            Prometheus is depicted unyielding, defiant, and heroic <lb/>
            in his torment have always excited admiration ; but <lb/>
            the lines on which the final reconciliation was accom- <lb/>
            plished can only be conjectured, since the remaining <note type="footnote"> 1 See Grote, History of Greece, chap. i. p. 41 ; Dictionary of Anti- <lb/>
            quities, s.v. Eleusinia. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="XIV"/>
            plays of the trilogy, though their titles have come <lb/>
            down to us, are lost. In his greatest achievement, the <lb/>
            Oresteian trilogy, with which he gained the prize in <lb/>
            B.C. 458, the traditional story of Agamemnon, as <lb/>
            it presented itself to the mind of Æschylus, invited <lb/>
            the solution of two difficulties. In the first place, it <lb/>
            was necessary to account for the fact that Agamemnon, <lb/>
            the heroic leader,-distinguished by birth, wealth, and <lb/>
            success in arms,-ended his career overwhelmed by <lb/>
            apparently undeserved misfortune. Secondly, in more <lb/>
            general terms, as arising out of the particular cases of <lb/>
            the fall of Troy, the death of Agamemnon, and the <lb/>
            action of Orestes, it was necessary to justify the deal- <lb/>
            ings of Heaven with mankind. The transition from <lb/>
            the Old Order to the New, which was exemplified in the <lb/>
            Prometheus trilogy by the passing of the supremacy <lb/>
            from Kronos (sovereign of the elder gods) to Zeus ; <lb/>
            and the mysterious limitation imposed by Destiny; 1 <lb/>
            appear again in the Eumenides.2 In that play the <lb/>
            conflicting claims of the Furies (’<foreign xml:lang="grc">Ερινύες</foreign>), who belong <lb/>
            to the old Elemental Powers,3 and of Apollo are <lb/>
            referred to the arbitrament of Pallas. Nor does <lb/>
            Æschylus shrink from dissociating himself from <lb/>
            traditional and current beliefs where the popular <lb/>
            view, in his opinion, mistakes the attitude of the <lb/>
            gods, or wrongly interprets it. " Alone am I in my <note type="footnote"> 1 Prometheus Bound 531 :</note><figure type="illustration">

              opinion, at variance with other men,”1 he says, in <lb/>
              dissenting from the commonly accepted theory on the <lb/>
              subject of prosperity.</p>
          <p>It remains to be added that an interesting question <lb/>
            as to the relation of AEschylus to the politics of his <lb/>
            time is raised by the Eumenides. It was produced at <lb/>
            a time when party feeling ran high at Athens.2 The <lb/>
            senate of Areopagus had about this date been <lb/>
            radically reformed 3 by the democratic party under <lb/>
            Ephialtes and Pericles. It had been the custom of the <lb/>
            Areopagus to exercise a censorial power both over the <lb/>
            Assembly and over the lives of the citizens. This <lb/>
            discretionary supervising authority was taken away, <lb/>
            and it remained only as a court for trying cases of <lb/>
            homicide. The conservative, or oligarchic, party had <lb/>
            also met with a reverse in their foreign policy. The <lb/>
            democratic party had succeeded in breaking off the <lb/>
            alliance of Athens with Sparta, and substituting an <lb/>
            alliance with Argos, the enemy of Sparta. Now, in the <lb/>
            Eumenides Æschylus represents the case of Orestes, who <lb/>

            She institutes the court of Areopagus to decide the <lb/>
            question, and Orestes is acquitted. It has been argued, <lb/>

            exalt the Areopagus by assigning to it a divine origin, <lb/>
            with the political object of defending it against the <lb/>
            proposed radical reforms. It is more probable,4 how- <note type="footnote"> 1 Agamemnon 756. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Eum. 863 sqq.

            cases of homicide is in harmony with its original con- <lb/>

            Earth, the Scythian track, a desert wilderness; and now, <lb/>
            Hephaestus, thou must attend to the charges which the <lb/>
            Father has enjoined upon thee, to clamp this malefactor to <lb/>
            the towering crags in firm shackles of adamantine bonds. <lb/>
            For thine own rare jewel, the bright fire enabling every art, <lb/>
            he stole and gave to mortal men; that is the sin for which <lb/>
            he must give satisfaction to the Gods, that he may be<lb n="10"/>
            taught to accept the sovereignty of Zeus and cease from his <lb/>
            man-befriending ways.</p>
          <p>Heph. Power and Force, the charge of Zeus to you is <lb/>
            finished now, and there is nothing more before you; but I <lb/>
            have not the heart to bind a brother-God by force upon a <lb/>
            wintry bleak; however, come what may, strong need con- <lb/>
            strains me to take courage for it; for to make light of the <lb/>
            Father's words is a grave thing. (To PROMETHEUS.) Thou <lb/>
            high-contriving son of right-advised Themis, it is with a <lb/>

            frost; and ever the sore burden of the present ill shall <lb/>
            harass thee; for thy deliverer is not yet born.</p>
          <p>These are the fruits that thou hast reaped from thy man- <lb/>
            befriending bent; thou didst not quail before the anger of <lb/>
            thy fellow-Gods, but in transgression of right bestowedst <lb n="30"/>
            honours upon mortals. Wherefore thou shalt keep sentry at <lb/>
            this dismal rock, in upright posture, sleepless, never bending <lb/>
            knee; and many a groan and unavailing lamentation shalt <lb/>
            thou utter; for the heart of Zeus is inexorable, and every- <lb/>
            one is harsh whose power is new.</p>

            lessly? Why dost thou not view with hatred one most <lb/>
            hateful to the Gods, who betrayed thy precious thing and <lb/>
            gave it to mankind ?</p>
          <p>Heph. Blood hath a strange power, and companionship.</p>
          <p>Power. I agree, but to be disobedient to the Father's<lb n="40"/>

            of that ?</p>

          <p>Heph. 0 how I hate this mastery of craft!</p>
          <p>Power. Why hate it ? For these present troubles Art is <lb/>
            absolutely not to blame.</p>

            the enemies of Zeus! See thou be pitying not thyself <lb/>
            one day!</p>

            throw the girths now around his ribs.</p>
          <p>Heph. I am bound to do it; you need not urge me on <lb/>
            so much.</p>
          <p>Power. Indeed I will urge, and halloo thee on too! Go <lb/>
            down below, and ring his legs round strongly.</p>
          <p>Heph. There is the work done without much labour.</p>

            What power have mortals to relieve thee of thy pains ? 'Tis <lb/>

            against me.</p>
          <p>Ah me, ah me, I groan for suffering present and for <lb/>

          <p>And yet, what say I ? I have clear fore-knowledge of all <lb/>

            surprise; and the lot by Fate appointed one must bear as <lb/>
            easily as may be, recognising that the strength of Necessity <lb/>
            is not to be striven with. And yet to hold my peace, and <lb/>
            not to hold my peace about my case is equally impossible : <lb/>
            it was for making gifts to mortals that I have been fastened <lb/>
            in these torments:—I hunted out the spring of Fire con- <lb/>

            hath been revealed to mortal men for their instructress in <lb/>

            matter of derision ? Who shares not indignation at thy <lb n="170"/>
            distresses-except Zeus ? He, with continual rancour, <lb/>

            strong fettering shackles, the prime lord of the Blessed Ones <lb/>
            shall yet have need of me, to reveal him the new project, <lb/>

            will I ever quail, to reveal the secret, until he loosen me <lb/>

            upon and see the termination of these pains: for a nature <lb/>
            beyond reaching and a heart inexorable hath the Son of <lb n="200"/>
            Cronos.</p>
          <p>Prom. Harsh, I know, he is, and with the law in his own <lb/>
            hands; 1 nevertheless his will, I reckon, shall be soft enough <lb/>

              shall assuage his stubborn wrath and meet my eagerness <lb/>
              half-way, to enter into bond and amity with me.</p>
          <p>Chor. Unfold now to us all the story and declare what <lb/>
            charge it is that Zeus hath taken thee upon and tortures<lb n="210"/>
            thee with such disgrace and bitterness-unless there is any <lb/>
            harm to thee in telling.</p>
          <p>Prom. It is a painful thing to tell, and painful to withhold; <lb/>
            miserable every way.-When first the Deities began their <lb/>
            anger, and sedition was stirred up amongst them-one <lb/>
            party seeking to cast Cronos from his throne, to make Zeus <lb/>
            king, to wit, the other bent upon the contrary, that Zeus <lb/>
            should never reign over the Gods,-I thereupon endeavoured<lb n="220"/>
            to persuade the Titans, children of Heaven and Earth, with <lb/>
            the best advice, and was not able ; subtle stratagems they <lb/>
            quite despised, and thought with violent imaginations to <lb/>
            gain the mastery without trouble and by force. But more <lb/>
            than once my Mother, Themis or Gaea (Earth)-one form <lb/>
            with many titles-had foretold to me the way in which the <lb/>
            future was decreed to happen-how that it was not by <lb/>
            strength or in the way of violence that the overcomers were <lb/>
            to gain the mastery, but by guile. When I expounded this <lb n="230"/>
            to them in speech, they would not deign so much as even <lb/>
            to look at it. So the best course that lay before me then <lb/>
            appeared to be that I should take my Mother's aid and <lb/>
            range myself, a welcome volunteer, upon the side of Zeus. <lb/>
            And through my counselling it is that the black nether deep <lb/>
            of Tartarus buries now the ancient Cronos with his allies <lb/>
            together. These are the benefits which the sovereign of <lb/>
            the Gods hath received from me and hath requited me <lb/>
            with a reward so ill; for it is a vice inherent somehow in a <lb n="240"/>
            sovereignty, that there is no putting trust in friends.</p>
          <p>But for your question, on what charge it is that he is <lb/>
            torturing me, that I will make plain.</p>
          <p>So soon as ever he was seated on his Father's throne, he <lb/>
             <pb n="10"/>
            set about assigning to, the Powers Divine their several <lb/>
            privileges and mapped out their spheres of rule; but of <lb/>
            wretched mortals he took no account whatever, but desired <lb/>
            to annihilate the race entirely and create another new one. <lb/>
            And to this there was no one that made any opposition<lb n="250"/>
            except me; I had the courage, I delivered men from being <lb/>
            smashed to pieces and descending to the house of Death. <lb/>
            And that is why I am now being bent with punishments <lb/>
            like this, painful to suffer and piteous to behold: after <lb/>
            preferring mortal men in pity I was not allowed to win the <lb/>
            same myself, but have been straitened into shape thus <lb/>
            mercilessly-a spectacle far from glorious to Zeus.</p>
          <p>Chor. A heart of iron and made out of rock, Prometheus, <lb/>
            is the being that feels not compassion in thy labours: I <lb/>
            should have wished never to behold them, and beholding<lb n="260"/>
            them my heart is grieved.</p>
          <p>Prom. I am indeed a sight that friends might pity.</p>
          <p>Chor. Didst thou, perhaps, transgress a little beyond <lb/>
            this?</p>
          <p>Prom. Yes, I caused Men no longer to foresee their <lb/>
            latter end.</p>
          <p>Chor. What was the medicine that you discovered for <lb/>
            that ailment?</p>
          <p>Prom. I implanted in their breasts blind Hopes.</p>
          <p>Chor. That was a great boon that you bestowed upon <lb/>
            them.</p>
          <p>Prom. And there was this besides,-I gave them Fire.</p>
          <p>Chor. And do weak mortals now possess the flame-eyed <lb/>

          <p>Prom. Yes, from which they will learn many Arts.<lb n="270"/>

            pains ?</p><pb n="11"/>
            
          <p>Prom. No, none whatever, except when it seems good to <lb/>
            him.</p>
          <p>Chor. And how can it seem good ? What hope is there ? <lb/>
            Seest thou not that thou hast erred, and how thou erredst <lb/>
            it is not pleasurable to me to say, and pain to thee.-But let <lb/>
            us leave this matter; turn thou now to seeking some release <lb/>
            from thine affliction.</p>
          <p>Prom. It is an easy thing for one whose feet are safe out <lb/>
            of the mire of harm to give advice and admonition to<lb n="280"/>
            another in distress; but I was aware beforehand of all this; <lb/>
            of will, of will I erred, I will not deny it f succouring men, <lb/>
            I got me sufferings myself. But still I never thought that <lb/>
            I should be rewarded in this wise, to pine away upon rocks <lb/>
            between earth and heaven, and get this desert and unneigh- <lb/>
            boured peak.-Now, pray you, mourn no longer for my present <lb/>
            woes, but step upon the ground and let me tell you what is <lb/>
            the oncoming future, that you may know the whole matter <lb/>
            thoroughly. Consent, I pray, consent, show sympathy with<lb n="290"/>
            the one in trouble now; you know, 'tis common, and mis- <lb/>
            fortune settles now upon one and now upon another.</p>
          <p>Chor. Thine appeal is urged on willing hearts, Prometheus. <lb/>
            So with light footstep I will quit my speeding seat and the <lb/>
            pure airy path of winged creatures and draw nigh to yonder <lb/>
            rugged land; and I desire to hear the whole story of thy <lb/>

            passage here to thee, Prometheus, guiding this swift-winged <lb/>
            creature by my will without a bit; and be assured that I am <lb/>
            sorry for the state that thou art in : relationship, I suppose, <lb/>
            compels me, and apart from blood, there is no one I should <lb/>
            have more consideration for than thee: and you will see that <lb/>

            this is genuine and that there is no tongue-benefit in me,<lb n="310"/>
            for come, name anything that I am to assist you in: you <lb/>
            will never say that you have any truer friend than Ocean !1</p>
          <p>Prom. Ha, what have we here? Hast thou too come <lb/>
            to view my sufferings? How didst thou nerve thyself to <lb/>
            leave the stream that bears thy name and those rock- <lb/>
            vaulted self-built caverns, and to come unto this iron-womb- <lb/>
            ing land ? Is it to view my state that thou art come, and <lb/>
            to compassionate in my distress ? Behold the spectacle-<lb n="320"/>
            me here, the friend of Zeus, that helped him to set up his <lb/>
            sovereignty, behold the sufferings that I am bent with now <lb/>
            by him</p>
          <p>Oc. I see, Prometheus, and desire also to give thee <lb/>
            the best advice, ingenious as thou art: recognise thyself, <lb/>
            and adopt a new fashion of behaviour, for there is a new <lb/>
            Sovereign in Heaven. But if thou persist in flinging out <lb/>
            such harsh and whetted words, Zeus, though seated far <lb/>
            aloft, perhaps may hear thee, so that thy present multitude 2 <lb/>
            of miseries shall seem but child's-play. Come, unhappy<lb n="330"/>
            one, dismiss thy present mood and try to find some way <lb/>
            out of these troubles. What I say may seem, perhaps, <lb/>
            trite and stale,-but these, Prometheus, are just the wages <lb/>
            of a too presumptuous tongue. And you are not yet <lb/>
            humble or submissive to misfortune, but wish to get still <lb/>
            more than what you have already. If you will take my <lb/>
            advice, you will not stretch out your legs against the goad, <lb/>
            seeing that it is a harsh monarch now and irresponsible<lb n="340"/>
            that is in power. And now I shall go and try whether I <lb/>
            can release thee from thy pains; remain thou quiet, and be <lb/>
            not too violent in speech-or else, with thy superior mind- <note type="footnote"> 1 The character of Oceanus, the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἡσυχαστής</foreign> (compare the Orphic <lb/>

          <p>Prom. You are lucky to be clear of blame, after having <lb/>

            So now, let it alone and do not concern yourself about it, <lb/>
            for you will certainly not persuade him; he is not easy to <lb/>
            persuade. Look shrewdly to it that you get no harm <lb n="350"/>
            yourself upon this errand.</p>
          <p>Oc. Truly thou art better far at schooling others than <lb/>
            thyself! I judge by fact, not word. But as I am bent <lb/>
            upon my course, by no means draw the curb, for I am <lb/>
            confident, most confident, that Zeus will grant me this <lb/>
            concession, to release thee from these sufferings.</p>
          <p>Prom. I am much obliged, and shall never cease to be <lb/>
            so, for one thing-your zealousness leaves nothing to be <lb/>
            desired: only, take no trouble, for it will be but labour <lb/>
            wasted and do me no good-supposing that you mean to <lb/>

            way; for because I am in distress, I would not therefore <lb/>
            wish distresses to befall the whole world too. No indeed, <lb/>
            for I am troubled by the sad plight of my brother, Atlas, <lb/>

            Heaven bearing upon his shoulders, no sweet burden to <lb/>

            favour, more especially as they are sisters of thy Father ; <lb/>
            for to have one's fill of weeping and lament for sorrows in <lb/>
            a case where one is like to win a tear, is worth the while.</p>
          <p>10. I do not know how I can be disobedient to you ; ye <lb/>
            shall hear in plain terms everything that ye desire of me :— <lb/>
            yet I am ashamed even in the telling of the heaven-inflicted <lb n="670"/>
            storm and ruin of my features-to tell whence it swooped <lb/>
            upon unhappy me.</p>
          <p>There were visions in the night continually haunting me, <lb/>
            that kept visiting my bower with smooth words: ' O thou <lb/>
            highly-blessèd Maiden, why art thou so long a virgin when <lb/>
            thou mayest win the greatest marriage ? The heart of Zeus <lb/>
            hath been inflamed by an arrow of desire from thee, and he <lb/>
            would fain have loving converse with thee: thou, therefore, <lb/>
            my child, lift not thy foot to kick away the bed of Zeus, but go <lb/>
            thou forth unto the deep meadow-land of Lerna to thy fathers<lb n="680"/>
            flocks and oxen-stalls, to the end that the eye of Zeus may be <lb/>
            eased of his desire.'</p>
          <p>With dreams like this I was afflicted every night; until <lb/>
            at last I brought myself to confess the haunting visions to <lb/>
            my father: and he kept sending frequent ambassadors to <lb/>
            the oracles of Pytho and Dodona to find out what act or <lb/>
            word he must perform to do the pleasure of the Deities. <lb/>
            And they kept coming back with vaguely-spoken oracles of <lb/>
            dim significance and darkly worded. But at last there <lb n="690"/>
            came to Inachus a clear injunction, charging him directly <lb/>
            in so many words to thrust me from my home and country <lb/>
            to go wandering free at the extremities of the earth; and <lb/>
            if he refused, a fiery thunderbolt should come from Zeus, <lb/>
            which should destroy his whole house utterly.</p>
          <p>Yielding obedience to this response of Loxias, he drove <lb/>
             <pb n="24"/>
            me out and shut me from the house-as sorely against his <lb/>
            will as mine; but the constraint of Zeus was upon him <lb/>
            as a bridle, forcing him to do this thing.</p>
          <p>And immediately my shape and senses were distorted,<lb n="700"/>
            and with horns, as ye behold, upon my head, fretted with <lb/>
            a sharp-biting sting I rushed with frantic leaps to the sweet <lb/>
            drinking water of Kerchneia, and the springs of Lerna; and <lb/>
            an earth-born herdsman of unmitigated temper, Argos, <lb/>
            followed, having vision with a host of eyes, upon my steps. <lb/>
            But a sudden destruction came upon him unawares1 and <lb/>
            took his life. And I, still frenzy-stung, am driven by the <lb/>
            scourge of God from land to land.</p>
          <p>This is the story of these doings, and if thou canst tell<lb n="710"/>
            me what is the remainder of my toils, declare it, and do <lb/>
            not out of pity flatter me with falsehood, for I think that <lb/>
            made-up stories are the most shameful vice.</p>
          <p>Chor. Ah, ah! away !</p>
          <p>Never, never did I dream that such unheard-of utterances <lb/>
            would come to my hearing, or such hideous, fearful suffer- <lb/>
            ings, tortures, terrors, pierce me with a prong and strike a <lb/>

            I think it very likely that <foreign xml:lang="grc">αἰΦνίδιος</foreign> is a gloss on <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἅπτερος</foreign> : because with <lb/>
            scholiasts it was one of the recognised interpretations of the doubtful <lb/>

            wings, wing-swift; and the vagueness would be suitable, because the <lb/>
            legends differed as to the manner in which Hermes killed Argus. In <lb/>
            such cases Aeschylus is fond of using terms which will apply to various <lb/>

          <p>First, Io, I will show to thee thy long-tossed wandering, <lb/>
            which do thou inscribe on the memorial tables of thy mind.</p>
          <p>After thou hast crossed the stream which is the bourne <lb/>
            of the two continents, towards the fiery Sun-trod Orient,2 <lb/>
            passing the swelling surge of the sea, until thou reach the <lb/>
            Gorgon Plains of Kisthene, where dwell the Daughters of <lb/>
            Phorcys, ancient of days, three, of swan fashion, with one<lb n="820"/>
            eye in common, and with one tooth only-upon whom the <lb/>
            sun looks never with his rays, neither the moon by night. <lb/>
            And near them are there sisters three, covered with wings <lb/>
            and fleeced with serpents, horrible to human kind, whom <lb/>
            no man born shall look upon and still draw breath.</p>
          <p>Such is the nature of the opening scene 3; now listen to <lb/>
            another uncouth spectacle: There are the sharp-mouthed <lb/>
            eagle-barking hounds of Zeus, the Gryphons, that you must <lb/>
            beware of, and the one-eyed host of Arimaspians, mounted <lb n="830"/>
            upon horses, who inhabit by the golden-flowing stream of <lb/>
            Pluto: these thou must not go nigh. And at the far end <lb/>
            of the earth 4 thou wilt arrive at the black tribe that dwell <lb/>
            near to the sources of the Sun, where is the river Ethiop. <lb/>
            Along his banks proceed thou until thou reach the falling <lb/>
            Cataract, where from the Byblus Mountains Nile sends forth <lb/>

            heard from me is not idle tale, I will rehearse the labours <lb/>
            she has gone through before coming here, and give this <lb/>
            for a warrant of my story.-Well, the great bulk of the <lb/>
            narrative I will omit, and come to the conclusion of her <lb/>
            wanderings.</p>
          <p>After thou hadst come to the Molossian plains and the <lb/>
            steep ridges of Dodona, where there is an oracle and seat of <lb/>
            Zeus Thesprotian, and that prodigy incredible, the Talking <lb/>
            Oaks,-by whom thou distinctly and in no ambiguous <lb/>
            terms wast hailed as she that was to be the spouse of Zeus<lb n="860"/>
            —doth any touch in this appeal to thee?2—Thence in a <lb/>
            frenzy thou didst rush upon the path along the shore to the <lb/>
            great Gulf of Rhea, whence I see thee driven by a storm <lb/>
            and beaten back upon thy course ;-and for ensuing time <lb/>
            hereafter the sea-bay, be well assured, shall be called <lb/>
            Ionian, for a memorial of thy passage unto all mankind.</p>
          <p>This a sign of my intelligence, to show that it discerneth <lb/>
            more than what is visible.- The rest I will declare to you <lb n="870"/>
            (the Chorus) and her in common, picking up again the <lb/>

            country, at the very mouth and silted bank of Nile; and <lb/>
            there it is that Zeus is to restore thee to thy senses by the <lb/>
            mere laying on of his undreadful hand and by its touch <lb/>
            alone.</p>
          <p>And after the manner of his engendering shall be named <lb/>
            a son that thou shalt bear, the swarthy Epaphus, who shall <lb/>
            possess all the land that is watered by the broad stream of <lb/>
            the Nile. And fifth in descent from him a generation of <lb/>
            fifty children shall return again, not of their will, to Argos <lb n="880"/>
            —a female generation, flying from kindred marriage with <lb/>
            their cousins; they, with hearts excited, hawks in chase of <lb/>
            doves and close behind them, shall arrive there in pursuit <lb/>
            of marriage wrongful to pursue. But God shall grudge <lb/>
            possession of their bodies, and the Pelasgian land shall <lb/>
            give them welcome, the men being slain in woman- <lb/>
            battle with bold daring in the watches of the night :-for <lb/>
            each wedded woman shall take her husband's life by <lb/>

            daughters shall be charmed by love's desire to spare her <lb/>
            bedfellow; the edge of her resolve shall be abated, and <lb/>
            between two evils she shall choose the name of coward <lb/>
            rather than of murderess. She shall give birth in Argos to <lb/>
            a royal race. It would require a long discourse to go <lb/>
            through all this thoroughly,-the sum, however, is that from <lb/>

            dignities to mortal creatures, thou, the thief of Fire ! The <lb/>

            thou talkest of, by which he is to be cast out from his <lb n="980"/>

            but explain with each particular, and do not give me the <lb/>

          <p>Prom. Haughty indeed and full of lofty spirit for an <lb/>
            underling of the Gods! Your power is young, is young, <lb/>
            and you suppose the towers you dwell in to be scatheless : <lb/>
            Have I not seen from those same towers a brace of <lb/>
            sovereigns cast out ? And I shall see a third, this present <lb n="990"/>
            King, with shamefullest fall and quickest. Dost thou <lb/>
            imagine that I quail and cower before these new Gods? <lb/>
            I am far-the whole way-from it! Get thee back again, <lb/>
            trudge the road thou earnest by, for thou shalt be told <lb/>
            nothing that thou inquirest of.</p>
          <p>Hermes. Well, it was by just such headstrong wilfulness <lb/>
            before that thou didst land thyself! in this disaster.</p>
          <p>Prom. Be very sure, I would not exchange my mis- <lb/>
            fortunes for thy servitude.</p>
          <p>Hermes. Better, I suppose, to be in service to this rock <lb n="1000"/>
            than to be the trusted messenger of Father Zeus.</p>
          <p>Prom. That is the right way for insolence to be insulting.2</p>
          <p>Hermes. It seems that thou exultest in thy sufferings.</p>
          <p>Prom. Exult! may I behold my enemies exulting in this <lb/>
            way-and thee among them.</p>
          <p>Hermes. Why, dost thou count me to blame for what has <lb/>
            happened to thee ?</p>
          <p>Prom. In one word, I hate all the Gods that have had <lb/>
            good done to them and treat me ill unjustly.</p>
          <p>Hermes. Thou art brain-sick, mine ears tell me, in no <lb/>

          <p>Prom. But in his ageing course Time teaches everything.</p>
          <p>Hermes. Yet thou hast not yet learnt wise-mindedness.</p>
          <p>Prom. No, else I would not have spoken to an underling <lb/>
            like thee.</p>
          <p>Hermes. It seems that thou wilt not say anything that <lb/>
            the Father wishes.</p>
          <p>Prom. Well, if I were indebted to him I would repay.</p>
          <p>Hermes. Thou mockest me as if I were a mere child.</p>
          <p>Prom. Why art thou not a child and still more foolish, <lb/>
            if thou expectest to learn anything from me ? There is no <lb n="1020"/>
            torture or contrivance by which Zeus shall impel my lips <lb/>
            to utter it, until my galling bondage be undone. So let <lb/>
            the sooty flame be hurled upon me, and with white feathery <lb/>
            snow and earthquake-thunderings let him make ruin and <lb/>
            confusion of the world ! For nought of this shall bend my <lb/>
            will to tell by whose hand he is to be dispossessed.</p>
          <p>Hermes. Consider now whether this seem profitable to thee.</p>
          <p>Prom. It has been considered and determined long ago. <lb n="1030"/>
            </p>
          <p>Hermes. Find heart, thou foolish one, find heart at <lb/>
            length in face of these calamities to be right-minded.</p>
          <p>Prom. Thou art but vexing me in vain, like a wave,1 with <lb/>

            afraid before the will of Zeus, and grow effeminate and <lb/>

          <p>The Chorus, assembled in front of the palace (v. 144), give <lb/>

            Hellas, and guardians of the opulent palace rich in gold; <lb/>

            gold, my soul within me is at this present time disturbed, <lb n="10"/>

            neither any messenger nor any horseman arrives at the city, <lb/>
            of the Persians who left Susa and went forth, and Ecbatana, <lb/>

            send forth; Susiskanes was there, Pegastagon of Egyptian <lb/>
            family, and the prince of sacred Memphis, mighty Arsames, <lb/>
            and Ariomardos, governor of ancient Thebes; and inhabi- <lb/>
            tants of a marshy region-rowers of ships-skilful, and in <lb n="40"/>
            multitude innumerable. And a crowd of soft-living Lydians, <lb/>
            who keep in subjection a nation entirely land-faring, goes <lb/>
            with them, whom Metrogathes and valiant Arcteus, ruling <lb/>
            princes, and Sardis rich in gold send out, borne in many <lb/>
            chariots, in two-shafted ranks and in three-shafted ranks, <lb/>
            a sight terrible to see. Set too are the borderers on sacred <lb/>
            Tmolus on casting the yoke of servitude about Hellas,— <lb n="50"/>
            Mardon, Tharybis, anvils of the spear, and men of Mysia <lb/>
            whose weapon is the javelin. Babylon too, the rich in gold, <lb/>
            sends a mixed multitude in long array, some carried on <lb/>
            ships, some trusting in their courage to draw the bow. <lb/>
            And the scimitar-armed peoples of all Asia go with them, <lb/>
            under the dread mandates of the king. So fair a flower of <lb/>

            all the country of Asia which reared them is constrained <lb/>
            with vehement longing; and parents and wives, as they <lb/>
            count the days, tremble at the lengthening out of time.</p>
          <p>The army of the king, which makes havoc of cities, by <lb/>
            now has passed to the neighbouring land beyond the narrow <lb/>
            sea, having crossed the strait of Helle daughter of Athamas <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">εὐτλήμονι</foreign> (which some MSS. have). Cf.Simonides et. 40 <foreign xml:lang="grc">εὐτόλμψ <lb/>

            on a cable-fastened pontoon-bridge, by casting a riveted <lb n="70"/>
            causeway as a yoke upon the neck of Ocean.</p>
          <p>Against a whole continent does the fiery leader of populous <lb/>
            Asia direct his wondrous flock of men, in two divisions, with <lb/>
            land-forces and on sea, putting his trust in his stalwart sturdy <lb/>
            commanders-a being like unto the gods, of a race sprung <lb n="80"/>
            from gold.</p>
          <p>And flashing from his eyes the dark glance of a deadly <lb/>
            python, with many a warrior and many a sailor, and urging <lb/>
            forward his Syrian chariot, he is bringing against a people <lb/>
            famous for the spear a nation in arms whose pride is <lb/>
            the bow.</p>
          <p>There is no one of such proved puissance as to with- <lb/>
            stand the mighty torrent of men, and with secure defences <lb n="90"/>
            keep back the resistless tide; for the Persian army cannot <lb/>
            be faced, and stout-hearted are their people.</p>
          <p>But the beguiling Illusion of a god what mortal man <lb/>
            shall escape? Who is he that with agile foot is master of <lb/>
            an easy leap [over the net] ?</p>
          <p>Aye, for fawning at first upon him, as though with kind <lb/>
            intent,1 it leads a man astray into the toils of Calamity, <lb n="100"/>
            whence it is not possible for a mortal to escape and flee.</p>
          <p>For by the gods' will since long ago Fate has been <lb/>
            dominant, and has laid it upon the Persians to pursue wars <lb/>
            that demolish towers, and shocks of cavalry in action, and <lb/>
            destructions of cities. <lb n="110"/>
            </p>
          <p>Also they learned, putting trust in the slight structure of <lb/>
            tackling and in contrivances for carrying men [over the <lb/>
            waters], to look upon the ocean plain of the broad sea when <lb/>
            it whitens beneath the furious blast.</p>
          <p>Therefore my soul, shrouded in gloom, is racked with <lb/>
            dread (Ah ! Ah!) for this Persian expedition, fearing lest <note type="footnote"> 1 Cf. Agam. 726 and 1227. So Plutarch Them. 29 <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐ μὴν ἀλλὰ. <lb/>

            the state may learn that the great city of the Susian district <lb/>
            is made desolate of men, and the Cissians' town, as a crowd <lb/>
            of women utter this cry Ah ! Ah !, may echo back the strain, <lb/>
            and lest rending may fall on linen garments.</p>
          <p>For all the host, driving steeds or tramping over the <lb n="130"/>
            plain, is gone forth, like bees in a swarm, together with the <lb/>
            captain-general of the expedition; having crossed over the <lb/>
            projecting arm of the sea,1 now bridged over, which is <lb/>
            common to both continents.</p>
          <p>And by reason of yearning for absent warriors couches, <lb/>
            are filled with weeping; and Persian wives, indulging their <lb/>

            gallant armed consort, is left solitary. <lb n="140"/>

          <p>But come, Persians, let us seat ourselves beneath the <lb/>
            shade of this ancient palace and take good counsel from <lb/>
            the depths of thought (and need there is for it), as to how <lb/>
            haply fares Xerxes our king of Dareios' line, of the race of <lb/>
            [Perseus] our common ancestor-whether it is the drawing <lb/>
            of the bow that conquers, or has the power of the pointed<lb n="150"/>
            spear the mastery ? But here is hasting forth an effulgence <lb/>
            like to the eyes of gods, the Mother of the King, my <lb/>
            Queen; I prostrate myself before her. And fitting also is <lb/>
            it that we all address her in words of salutation.</p>

            and now come hither. My thoughts are racking ray heart; <lb/>
            and to you, ray friends, will I tell ray tale, being by no means <lb/>
            without misgiving about myself, in dread lest great Good <lb/>
            Fortune,1 raising over the earth the dust [of a military <lb/>
            advance], shall have overturned with its foot the [fabric of] <lb/>
            Prosperity which Dareios reared not unaided by some god. <lb/>
            Therefore is there a twofold anxious thought, inexpressible, <lb/>
            in my mind-not to honour with reverence a mass of riches <lb/>
            lacking men ; and again, that light shines not equal to their <lb/>
            strength on men lacking wealth. Our wealth, indeed, is <lb n="170"/>
            beyond cavil, but there is alarm concerning our eye-for I <lb/>
            hold the master's presence to be the eye of the palace- <lb/>
            wherefore, Persians, since these things are so, lend me, ye <lb/>
            aged Trusty ones, your counsel. For in my case all sound <lb/>
            resolutions are dependent upon you.</p>
          <p>Chorus. Be well assured, Queen of this land, not twice <lb/>
            hast thou to indicate either word or deed [to us] respecting <lb/>
            matters in which Power is wont to lead the way ; for loyal <lb/>
            to thy interests are we whom thou summonest as counsellors <lb/>
            in these affairs.</p>
          <p>Atossa. By many a dream in the night-time have I been <lb/>
            haunted ever since my son, having fitted out an armada,<lb n="180"/>
            went hence with design to ravage the Ionians' land. But <lb/>
            never saw I aught so clear as in the night just passed-and <lb/>
            I will tell it to thee. There seemed to appear before me <lb/>
            two women in fair attire, one apparelled in Persian raiment, <lb/>
            the other in Dorian, the twain pre-eminent in stature beyond <lb/>
            those living now, flawless in beauty, and sisters of the same <lb/>
            family. The country they inhabited was in the case of one <lb/>
            sister, Hellas—she having acquired it by lot—in the case <lb/>
            of the other, barbarian soil. These twain, as I thought<note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">δαίμων</foreign> Heimsoeth ; see v. 727. Cf. Agam. 392-5, and 993 (<foreign xml:lang="grc">πότμος</foreign>). <lb/>

            I perceived, were pursuing a quarrel one with the other; <lb/>
            and my son, having become aware of it, was seeking to <lb/>
            check and to pacify them, and yokes the pair to a chariot <lb/>
            and places harness over their necks. And one of them <lb/>
            towered loftily in these trappings, and kept her mouth <lb/>
            tractable in the reins; but the other began to plunge, and <lb/>
            with her hands tears in pieces the harness of the chariot, <lb/>
            and drags it furiously along with her, heeding not the bit, <lb/>
            and snaps the yoke asunder. Then falls my son, and his <lb n="200"/>
            father Dareios stands beside commiserating him. And <lb/>
            Xerxes, when he perceives him, rends his robes around <lb/>
            his body.</p>
          <p>These things I tell you I beheld in the night; but when <lb/>
            I had arisen, and touched with my hands the fair waters of <lb/>
            a spring, I took my station at an altar with incense in my <lb/>
            hand, intending to offer a sacred mixture to the divinities <lb/>
            who avert evil, for whom these ceremonies are proper. <lb/>
            But I see an eagle fleeing for refuge to the altar of Phcebus, <lb/>
            -and from terror I stood speechless, my friends,-and <lb/>
            after that I see a hawk rushing with outstretched wings <lb/>
            upon him, and with his talons plucking at his head; and <lb n="210"/>
            the eagle did nothing but cower down and yield his body. <lb/>
            This was terrifying for me to see, and so it is for you to <lb/>
            hear. For know ye well that my son, should he be success- <lb/>
            ful, would be regarded with awe, and supposing he should <lb/>
            not be successful,—he1 cannot be called to account by the <lb/>
            state, and if he escapes alive, he is, in any event, the ruler <lb/>
            of this land.</p>
          <p>Chorus. We desire not, 0 Mother, either to alarm thee <lb/>
            unduly by our words, or unduly to raise thy hopes; but if <lb/>
            thou didst see anything sinister, thou shouldst supplicate <lb n="220"/>
            the gods with prayer, and beseech diversion of these evils, <note type="footnote"> 1 She alters the conclusion of her sentence, wishing to dispel in <lb/>

            and that all good things may be fulfilled for thyself and thy <lb/>
            children and for the city and for all thy friends. And in <lb/>
            the second place it is proper that thou pour a libation to <lb/>
            the earth and to the dead; and in propitiatory wise do thou <lb/>
            ask this boon of thy spouse Dareios, whom thou declarest <lb/>
            thou didst see by night,-to send good things for thee and <lb/>
            for thy son to the light of day from beneath the earth; and <lb/>
            [ask that] the reverse of this, detained below the earth, <lb/>
            may fade away in darkness. Thus I advise thee with <lb/>
            kindly intent, guided only by the promptings of my mind. <lb/>
            And our interpretation is that in all ways a good issue will <lb/>
            be brought to pass for thee in this matter.</p>
          <p>Atossa. With kind intent, I know, to my son and to <lb/>
            my house, didst thou, the first interpreter of these visions,<lb n="230"/>
            determine thus their import. May what is good come to <lb/>
            pass. And all these things, as thou dost enjoin, will I per- <lb/>
            form for the gods and for those dear to me beneath the <lb/>
            earth when I have gone into the palace. But now on the <lb/>
            following points, my friends, I wish to be exactly informed;- <lb/>
            In what part of the world do they say Athens is situated ?</p>
          <p>Chorus. Far hence towards the west, where are the waning <lb/>
            fires1 of our Lord the Sun.</p>
          <p>Atossa. Was then my son so eager to make this city his <lb/>
            prey?</p>
          <p>Chorus. Yes, for thus would all Hellas become subject <lb/>
            to the Great King.</p>
          <p>Atossa. Is theirs an army with so full a complement of men?</p>
          <p>Chorus. Aye, and an army of such quality as once <lb/>
            wrought havoc on the Medes.</p>
          <p>Atossa. And what else have they besides? Is there <lb/>
            sufficing wealth in their homes ? <lb n="240"/>
            </p>

            in their hands ?</p>

            of grief [by his death] to Sardis—and Sisames the Mysian, <lb/>
            and Tharybis of Lyrnaian race, commander of five times <lb/>
            fifty ships, a warrior of goodly presence, lies dead, unhappy <lb/>
            man, in sorely wretched case. And a Syennesis, foremost <lb/>
            in courage, governor of the Cilicians, fell gloriously, after <lb/>
            giving more trouble to the foe than any other one man. <lb/>
            Of such among our leaders have I now made mention. I <lb n="330"/>
            report but a few out of the many misfortunes which I have <lb/>
            in mind.</p>
          <p>Atossa. Alas! I hear in this the very height of disaster-a <lb/>
            disgrace to the Persians, and [a cause for] shrill lamentations. <lb/>
            But turn thou back again, and tell me this, How great was <lb/>
             <pb n="51"/>
            the number of the Greek vessels that they ventured to join <lb/>
            battle with the Persian armament by charging with their <lb/>
            ships'-beaks upon it ?</p>
          <p>Messenger. As to numbers, be well assured that the bar- <lb n="340"/>
            barians1 had the advantage in ships; for on the Greek side <lb/>
            the whole numbers came to three divisions of thirty vessels, <lb/>
            and there was besides these a select division of ten. But <lb/>
            Xerxes had, for I know, a thousand in number of which he • <lb/>
            was commander, and those [besides] of superior class in <lb/>
            speed were two hundred and seven; this is the tale of them. <lb/>
            You do not think us the inferior force in this engagement ? <lb/>
            No, it was some divinity that destroyed the host, having <lb/>
            depressed the scales of fortune with a weight against our <lb/>
            side. The gods keep safe the city of their goddess Pallas. <lb n="350"/>
            </p>
          <p>Atossa. Then is Athens still unravaged ?</p>
          <p>Messenger. Yes, for whilst her warriors live she has a sure <lb/>
            protection.</p>
          <p>Atossa. Now tell me what was the beginning of the naval <lb/>
            encounter. Who were they who made the first move in <lb/>
            the fight? ' The Greeks? Or my son, from a sense of <lb/>
            exultation at the number of his ships ?</p>
          <p>Messenger. Some fiend it was, 0 mistress, or evil spirit <lb/>
            that appeared from somewhere, who began all the mischief. <lb/>
            A Greek, who came from the Athenian host, told thy son <lb/>
            Xerxes that if the darkness of black night should come the<lb n="360"/>
            Greeks would not stand fast, but, leaping on to the thwarts <lb/>
            of their vessels, would, each taking his own direction, <lb/>
            endeavour to save their lives by stealthy flight. And he, as <lb/>
            soon as he heard this, not realising the wile of the Greek <lb/>
            nor the jealousy of the gods, publishes to all the captains <lb/>
            the following order-when the sun should have ceased to <lb/>
            illumine the earth with his rays and darkness should have <lb/>
            laid hold on the temple of the sky, then to draw up vessels <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">βαρβάρους</foreign> Tumebus. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="52"/>
            in close order arranged in three lines to guard the sea-exits <lb n="370"/>
            and the murmuring straits ; and [to station] other vessels in <lb/>
            a circle round about the isle of Aias; understanding that, <lb/>
            if the Greeks shall escape an evil fate by finding some <lb/>
            means of escape for their ships, without being discovered, <lb/>
            it has been decreed that they shall all be deprived of their <lb/>
            heads. Such were his words, prompted by much confidence <lb/>
            of mind, since he knew not what was appointed by the gods <lb/>
            to come to pass. And the Persian troops in orderly fashion <lb/>
            and disciplined spirit set about preparing an evening meal, <lb/>
            and each seaman saw to the lashing of his oar about the <lb/>
            nicely fitted thole-pin. Then, when the light of the sun <lb n="380"/>
            had waned and night was coming on, every master of an <lb/>
            oar went to his ship, and every master of weapons. And <lb/>
            one line of warships kept cheering on another line and [the <lb/>
            Persians] make sail even as each man had orders, and the <lb/>
            livelong night ship-captains kept all the crews working their <lb/>
            vessels backwards and forwards. But though night began <lb/>
            to draw off, yet the Greek host made nowhere any kind of <lb/>
            attempt at a stealthy escape. When, however, day with its <lb/>
            white steeds, radiant to behold, had occupied all the earth,<lb n="390"/>
            first of all a cheer from the Greeks rang loudly like a <lb/>
            chant of triumph, and shrill and clear from the island crags <lb/>
            Echo returned the cry. And fear was in the hearts of all <lb/>
            the barbarians, finding themselves mistaken; for the Greeks <lb/>
            were then chanting a solemn pæan not as seeking to escape, <lb/>
            but as advancing to battle with daring courage. Next a <lb/>
            bugle with its call fired all their line to action, and at once <lb/>
            with foaming dash of oars in unison they smote, to the <lb n="400"/>
            word of command, the resounding brine. And rapidly the <lb/>
            whole of them came plain into view. The right wing in <lb/>
            good order led on foremost, and after that their whole <lb/>
            armament was coming on against us, and at the same time <lb/>
            a mighty shout could be heard, "Sons of the Greeks, <lb/>
             <pb n="53"/>
            advance ! Deliver your country, deliver your children and <lb/>
            your wives, the temples of your fathers' gods, the tombs of <lb/>
            your ancestors. Now is the contest which decides all!" <lb/>
            And then a confused noise of Persian tongues met them <lb/>
            from our line, and no longer was it a time for inaction, but <lb n="410"/>
            forthwith ship against ship struck its armoured prow. A <lb/>
            Greek vessel commenced the charge, and breaks off the <lb/>
            whole stern part of a Phoenician ship, and each [captain] <lb/>
            then steered his bark against some other vessel. At first <lb/>
            indeed the torrent of the Persian armament held its own. <lb/>
            But since the multitude of our ships was crowded in the <lb/>
            narrows, and they could give no assistance the one to the <lb/>
            other but [on the contrary] were rammed by the brazen- <lb/>
            pointed beaks of their friends, they splintered their whole <lb/>
            equipment of oars,-the Greek ships, too, all around them <lb n="420"/>
            noting their opportunity, kept charging them on every side, <lb/>
            -and the hulls of our vessels began to be capsized nor was <lb/>
            the sea any longer visible, so choked was it with wrecks and <lb/>
            slaughtered men; and the shores and the reefs were full of <lb/>
            them. Then in rout and confusion every ship, as many as <lb/>
            there were of the barbarian armament, sought to row away. <lb/>
            But the Greeks kept striking and hewing, as though we <lb/>
            were tunnies or some draught of fish, with fragments of <lb/>
            broken oars and splinters of wreckage; and cries of anguish <lb/>
            filled the open sea with shrieks, until the appearance <lb n="430"/>
            of dark night broke off [the combat]. Now the total <lb/>
            of our misfortunes, not even were I to recite the list of <lb/>
            them for ten days, could I complete for thee; for be well <lb/>
            assured that never on a single day died so great a number <lb/>
            of men.</p>
          <p>Atossa. Alas ! in very truth a mighty sea of troubles has <lb/>
            burst over the Persians and all the barbarian race.</p>
          <p>Messenger. Know well that their trouble reaches not yet <lb/>
            the half. Such an visitation of sufferings came upon them <lb n="440"/>
             <pb n="54"/>
            as by balance to draw, even twice over, an equal weight <lb/>
            with these [which I have pictured].</p>
          <p>Atossa. What turn of fortune could be yet more hateful <lb/>
            than this ? Say what the event is which thou declarest <lb/>
            came to the host, inclining the scale far on the side of evil.</p>
          <p>Messenger. As many of the Persians as were in the very <lb/>
            flower of life and most valiant in spirit and distinguished by <lb/>
            noble birth, and were ever amongst the foremost in loyalty <lb/>
            to the monarch himself, are dead in shameful plight by a <lb/>
            most inglorious doom.</p>
          <p>Atossa. Ah! grieved am I, my friends, at a grievous <lb/>
            event. But by what nature of doom sayest thou they are <lb/>
            lost to us ?</p>
          <p>Messenger. An island there is, lying off Salamis-in- <lb n="450"/>
            significant in size, a dangerous anchorage for ships-which <lb/>
            Pan who loves the dance doth ofttimes visit, haunting the <lb/>
            sea-beach thereof. Thither Xerxes sends these [chosen <lb/>
            warriors] in order that, whenever their foes wrecked from <lb/>
            out their ships should attempt to win safe to the island, <lb/>
            they might make an easy prey of the Greek soldiery and <lb/>
            slay them; and help their own comrades to safety from out <lb/>
            the sea-way—sadly at fault in his opinion of the future: for <lb/>
            when some god had given the glory of [victory in] the sea- <lb/>
            fight to the Greeks, that same day having secured their <lb/>
            bodies with brazen armour they set to leaping out of their <lb/>
            ships and forming a circle round about the entire island, <lb n="460"/>
            so that [the Persian band] were at a loss whither to turn. <lb/>
            For oft they were struck by stones thrown by hand and <lb/>
            arrows from the bow-string fell upon and destroyed them ; <lb/>
            and at last [ the Greeks] charging upon them with a simul- <lb/>
            taneous cheer strike them down, and hack in pieces the <lb/>
            limbs of the unhappy men, till they had utterly destroyed <lb/>
            the life in all of them. And Xerxes groaned aloud when <lb/>
            he saw the depth of his calamities, for he had a seat in full <lb/>
             <pb n="55"/>
            view of all the army-a'high knoll close to the ocean brine;<lb n="470"/>
            and, having rent his garments and uttered a shrill cry of <lb/>
            wailing and issued orders rapidly to the land-force, he <lb/>
            dismisses them in flight all disorderly.</p>
          <p>Such is the event which, in addition to the afore- <lb/>
            mentioned, thou hast to bewail.</p>
          <p>Atossa. 0 hateful divinity, how hast thou cheated the <lb/>
            Persians of their expectations! Bitter1 to himself did my <lb/>
            son find his [intended 2] punishment of Athens; and those <lb/>
            of the barbarians whom aforetime Marathon destroyed were <lb/>
            not enough [to satisfy thee], but my son—thinking to exact <lb/>
            atonement for them-drew down upon himself all this mass <lb/>
            of woe. <lb n="480"/>
            </p>
          <p>But as to the ships which have escaped destruction, tell <lb/>
            me where thou didst leave them. Hast thou skill to indicate <lb/>
            it clearly ?</p>
          <p>Messenger. The commanders of the ships which yet <lb/>
            remained to us take to straggling flight before the wind <lb/>
            precipitately. But the rest of the host came near destruc- <lb/>
            tion in Bœotia, some around the refreshment of a spring, <lb/>
            while harassed by thirst; but others, panting and exhausted, <lb/>
            make their way through to the land of the Phocians and <lb/>
            the Dorian country, and the Melian bay where the <lb/>
            Spercheios waters the plain with his kindly stream. And <lb n="490"/>
            thence the soil of the Achaean land received us sore in <lb/>
            need of food, and the towns of Thessaly: where indeed <lb/>
            very many perished by thirst and hunger, for both of these <lb/>
            were our lot. And we come to the Magnesian territory <lb/>
            and the land of the Macedonians, to the ford of Axios and <lb/>
            the reedy fens of Bolbe, and to Mount Pangaios—Edonian <lb/>
            country. But in that night Heaven called up winter <lb/>
            weather out of season, and freezes all the stream of sacred <note type="footnote"> 1 For this predicative use of <foreign xml:lang="grc">πικρὸς</foreign> see Euripides Medea 399. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Cf. Herodotus vii. 8. </note> <lb n="500"/>

            Strymon : and [many a] one who before that reckoned the <lb/>
            gods of no account did then pray to them with supplica- <lb/>
            tions, doing lowly reverence to earth and heaven.</p>
          <p>But when the army had made an end of invocations, it <lb/>
            essays to pass across the ice-bound stream.2 And whoso- <lb/>
            ever of us started to do so before the rays of the sun-god <lb/>
            were shed abroad, is now in safety ; for the sun's orb, <lb/>
            blazing brightly with its rays, by the heat of its flame pene- <lb/>
            trated [the ice of] the middle of the passage; and, one upon <lb/>
            another, our men fell in, and fortunate indeed was he who <lb/>
            soonest lost his breath and died. <lb n="510"/>
            </p>
          <p>And such as survived and won to safety, after having <lb/>
            with difficulty made their way in much tribulation to <lb/>
            Thrace, have now accomplished their escape and reached <lb/>
            the land of their homes-in scanty numbers; so that the <lb/>
            city of the Persians may well vent her grief in regret for <lb/>
            the best-beloved youth of our nation.</p>
          <p>Chorus. 0 divinity hard to strive against, how with thy <lb/>
            feet didst thou leap over-heavily upon the whole Persian <lb/>
            race!</p>

            share in his decision.</p>
          <p>Ghost. Alas, some divinity came in might upon him, so <lb/>
            that his judgment was at fault.</p>

          <p>Ghost. And over what result to the troops art thou <lb/>
            lamenting thus ?</p>

            heaven. I for a long time past felt assured that the gods <lb/>
            would in some way bring it to accomplishment, but when <lb/>
            a man is of himself hurrying [to the doom appointed] the <lb/>
             <pb n="64"/>
            -gods too lend a helping hand. A fountain of misfortune <lb/>
            for all those dear to me seems now to have been discovered : <lb/>
            and my son, not knowing their full meaning, brought these <lb/>
            things to pass by his youthful rashness-inasmuch as he <lb/>
            thought to hold from its course the sacred Hellespont, the <lb/>
            divine stream of Bosporus, by shackles as it were a slave; <lb/>
            and sought to rule the Strait in harmony [with his will]. <lb/>
            Having encompassed it with hammer-wrought fetters, he <lb n="750"/>
            completed a huge road for his huge army, and thought <lb/>
            mistakenly that, mortal though he was, he would master <lb/>
            even the god Poseidon. Surely in this a distemper of <lb/>
            mind possessed my son? I fear lest my great hard-won <lb/>
            wealth may become a prey to the first comer.</p>
          <p>Atossa. These notions impetuous Xerxes learns by con- <lb/>
            sorting with misguided men. They tell him how that thou <lb/>
            didst win great wealth for thy children by help of the spear- <lb/>
            point, whilst he, from lack of manhood, keeps his spear at <lb/>
            home and increases not at all the wealth he inherited. <lb/>
            Hearing again and again such taunts as these from mis- <lb/>
            guided men, he planned this expedition and armada against <lb/>
            Hellas. <lb n="760"/>
            </p>
          <p>Ghost. Therefore by him has a deed been brought to <lb/>
            its accomplishment, exceeding great, never to be forgotten, <lb/>
            such as never before fell upon and made desolate this city <lb/>
            of Susa since first sovereign Zeus assigned to a man this <lb/>
            dignity, that he alone should be the ruler of Asia with its <lb/>
            flocks and herds,1 holding a sceptre of supreme command.</p>
          <p>For [Astyages] a Median was the first who was leader of <lb/>
            a great host, and his son [Cyaxares], another Median, <lb/>
            completed the work-since good sense guided his mind. <lb/>
            And, third from him, Cyrus, a fortunate man, when he <lb n="770"/>
            came to the throne established peace for all his own people, <lb/>
            and gained over the Lydian and Phrygian nations and <note type="footnote"> 1 The old Ionic epithet of Asia. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="65"/>
            subdued by force of arms all Ionia; for the gods hated <lb/>
            him not, inasmuch he was of moderate temper. And, <lb/>
            fourth in succession, [Cambyses] son of Cyrus was ruler <lb/>
            of the host. Then, fifthly, Mardos came to power, a <lb/>
            disgrace to his country and the ancient throne; but him <lb/>
            by stratagem valiant Artaphrenes, with the aid of friends <lb/>
            whose part this was, slew in the palace. And sixth was <lb/>
            Maraphis, and seventh Artaphrenes. And I attained the <lb n="780"/>
            lot which I desired, and went on a foreign expedition <lb/>
            attended by a mighty host, but did not bring such a great <lb/>
            disaster as this upon the state. But my son Xerxes, being <lb/>
            still youthful, has a young man's thoughts, and does not <lb/>
            bear in mind my injunctions. Of this be well assured, <lb/>
            ye compeers of my age,-the whole number of us who <lb/>
            obtained the empire could not be shown to have done it <lb/>
            so much harm.</p>
          <p>Chorus. What then, my lord Dareios ? Pointing to what <lb/>
            end dost thou bring to a close thy speech ? In what way <lb n="790"/>
            can we, the Persian people, after what has happened, find <lb/>
            best fortune ?</p>
          <p>Ghost. If we make no expedition against the Grecian <lb/>
            territory-not even though the Median force be superior <lb/>
            in numbers; for to them the very earth is an ally.</p>
          <p>Chorus. In what sense meanest thou that ? In what way <lb/>
            does it fight on their side ?</p>
          <p>Ghost. By slaying through famine such as are over-many <lb/>
            in number.</p>
          <p>Chorus. Well, in that case, we will muster a picked <lb/>
            mobile force.</p>
          <p>Ghost. Nay, not even the troops that have remained now <lb/>
            in Greek territory shall attain a safe return.</p>
          <p>Chorus. How sayest thou ? Does not the whole bar- <lb n="800"/>

            heaven; for they are coming true, not partly only [but in <lb/>
            every particular].</p>
          <p>No, their abiding-place is where Asopus waters the plain <lb/>
            with his streams-a kindly nourishment for the Boeotians' <lb/>
            land: where the height of disaster is in store for them to <lb/>
            suffer as retribution for their pride and impious spirit, in <lb/>
            that when they came to Hellas they made no scruple to <lb n="810"/>
            despoil the statues of the gods, nor to burn temples. <lb/>
            Altars have been demolished, and shrines of divinities are <lb/>
            overthrown from their foundations in heaps of ruin. <lb/>
            Therefore, for the evil they did, an equal measure do <lb/>

          <p>Atossa. 0 Fortune, how many bitter griefs are coming <lb/>

            grievous doom, most baffling to my judgment! How <lb/>
            savagely did Fortune assail the Persian race ! What is <lb/>
            there for me yet to endure in my misery ? The strength <lb/>
            of my limbs is relaxed when I behold the age of my <lb/>
            citizens to be what I see here before me. Would that me <lb/>
            also, 0 Zeus, the doom of death had hidden from sight <lb/>
            along with the warriors who have perished !</p>
          <p>Chorus. Alack, my sovereign, for the goodly army and <lb n="920"/>
            the great prestige of the Persian empire, and the fair <lb/>
            array of men whom Fortune hath shorn away ! The land <lb/>

            Alas, alas for our trusty strength ! And the land of Asia, <lb n="930"/>
            0 monarch of the country, is pitiably pitiably bowed to her <lb/>
            knees.</p>
          <p>Xerxes. Here am I before you, ah me! a man to grieve <lb/>
            over, and in misery, who was born, it seems, a curse to his <lb/>
            race and his country.</p>
          <p>Chorus. In salutation of thy return I will utter a cry <lb/>
            boding ill, the voice of a Mariandynian mourner busied <lb n="940"/>
            with woe, a tearful wail.</p>
          <p>Xerxes. Pour forth a plaintive piteous cry of sorrow; for <lb/>
            Fortune, as ye see, has turned against me.</p>
          <p>Chorus. I will utter a cry piteous indeed, in recognition <lb/>

            foe, obtain a harvest of woe; after having had the dark <lb/>

          <p>Eteocles. Citizens of Cadmus, it is fitting that whosoe'er <lb/>
            at the helm of the [ship of] State watches over affairs, <lb/>
            managing the rudder without closing his eyelids in slumber, <lb/>

            meet with success, the cause of it would be [put to the <lb/>
            credit] of Heaven ; but if on the contrary-which may God <lb/>

            of which may Zeus prove to the Cadmean city rightly <lb/>
            named Averter.</p>
          <p>You it now behoves-both him that yet falls short of 10 <lb/>
            manhood's prime, and him that is past it but yet keeps up a <lb/>

            prove yourselves worthy of trust at the present need. <lb n="20"/>
            </p>
          <p>So now until to-day Heaven inclines in our favour; for <lb/>
            during all this time [the fortune of] war has mostly gone <lb/>
            well for the besieged; but now, as declares the seer, the <lb/>
            feeder of birds who by ear and judgment, without the aid <lb/>
            of fire, revolves [the import of] birds of omen with unerring <lb/>
            art-he who is master of that kind of divination tells us that <lb/>
            an Achaean attack, greater than any yet, is being discussed <lb/>
            in the night and that they will plan an assault upon the city. <lb/>
            Come, hasten all ye to the battlements and to the gates of <lb n="30"/>
            the defences ! Make speed equipped in full armour, man the <lb/>
            breast-works, and, taking each his station on the platforms of <lb/>
            the towers, stand fast and be of good courage; nor tremble <lb/>
            over-much at the crowd of aliens. Heaven will guide aright <lb/>
            the issue. I for my part, also, sent out scouts and observers <lb/>
            of their host, who are, I am confident, on no useless errand; <lb/>
            and, when I hear their report, I shall in no wise be caught <lb/>
            by stratagem.</p>

            I am returned bringing clear tidings of what is going forward <lb/>

            Seven warriors, gallant captains, having cut a bull's throat <lb/>

            Terror that rejoiceth in slaughter, that, either they would <lb/>
            sack the citadel of the Cadmeans bringing destruction upon <lb/>
            it by force of arms, or in death would mingle their blood <lb/>
            with this soil. And memorials of themselves, destined for <lb/>
            their homes, were they hanging for their parents upon the <lb n="50"/>
            chariot of Adrastos, shedding tears-though no sound of <lb/>
            complaint was on their lips; for a spirit of iron determina- <lb/>
            tion as of lions with battle in their eyes was inspiring them, <lb/>
            kindling them with valour. And of this the report is not <lb/>

            drawing lots as to how each of them, receiving his post by <lb/>
            the lot, should lead his company against our gates. There- <lb/>

            and white foam from their horses' lungs is marking the <lb n="60"/>
            plain with spots. Do thou, like a good ship’s-helmsman, <lb/>
            secure the citadel before the blast of war rushes down; for <lb/>
            the surge of their host is roaring over the land. So do thou <lb/>
            in respect of this seize occasion, as may be most rapid. I <lb/>

            in dangers nor in welcome prosperity may I ever be <lb/>
            companion of the female sex; for a woman, when she has <lb/>
            her way, is a bold thing impossible to live with, and when <lb/>
            she is terrified, is a yet greater mischief to home and city. <lb/>

            supplications of the gods that they would extend their aid <lb/>
            to the city.</p>
          <p>Eteocles. Let your prayer be that the defences may keep <lb/>
            out the foe. This will be for the gods to grant. But, all <lb/>
            the same, 'tis said that when a city is taken, her gods <lb/>
            desert her.</p>

            unconquered, and that our defences keep off a horde of <lb/>

            of ours] ? <lb n="220"/>
            </p>
          <p>Eteocles. I have no objection to your honouring the race <lb/>
            of gods. But, that ye may not make the citizens lose <lb/>
            heart, be quiet ; and do not over-much give way to terror.</p>

            fear I came all in confusion to the acropolis, the abode of <lb/>
            honour.</p>
          <p>Eteocles. Do not ye, if ye hear of any dying or wounded, <lb/>
            be eager to receive them with cries of sorrow. For the <lb/>
            slaughter of men is that whereon Ares is maintained. <lb n="230"/>

            that thou hearest.</p>
          <p>Chorus. The city groans from earth beneath, as though <lb/>
            men were surrounding it.</p>
          <p>Eteocles. Then it is enough that I should take measures <lb/>
            about this.</p>
          <p>Chorus. I am in fear: a battering is increasing at the <lb/>
            gates.</p>
          <p>Eteocles. Will you keep silence, and say nought about it <lb/>
            up and down the city ?</p>
          <p>Chorus. 0 ye assembled gods, desert not our defences.</p>

            fate.</p>
          <p>Eteocles. 'Tis thou thyself that art like to enslave both <lb/>

          <p>Chorus. 0 almighty Zeus, turn thy bolt against our <lb/>
            enemies.</p>
          <p>Eteocles. 0 Zeus, what a race of women hast thou given <lb/>
            to us !</p>
          <p>Chorus. Truly a miserable one-as are men whose city <lb/>
            has been taken by the enemy.</p>
          <p>Eteocles. Dost thou speak ill-omened words, and that <lb/>
            whilst touching the images ?</p>
          <p>Chorus. Through timidity fear runs away with my tongue.</p>
          <p>Eteocles. If only thou wouldst grant a trifling boon to my <lb/>
            request!</p>
          <p>Chorus. Speak it as quickly as may be, and I shall <lb/>
            quickly know.</p>
          <p>Eteocles. Be silent then, wretched woman; terrify not your <lb/>
            friends.</p>

            after hearing my prayer, then do thou loudly chant a solemn <lb/>
            strain of well-wishing, the cry accompanying sacrifice [pre- <lb/>

            abandon to its foes this deep-soiled country and the water <lb/>
            of Dircè, most healthful of all draughts that Poseidon the <lb/>

            numerous (ah me!) when a city is captured are the ills it <lb/>
            suffers. One drags off another, slays, sets fire to parts of the <lb/>

          <p>Messenger. I can tell from full observation the doings of <lb/>
            our opponents, and how each has drawn his allotted station at <lb/>
            our gates. Tydeus already at the gate of Proetus is fretting <lb/>
            -yet the seer forbids him to cross the Ismenus, since the <lb/>
            sacrifices are not propitious. But Tydeus in wild excitement <lb/>
            and eager for the fray is uttering sounds like hissings of a <lb/>
            snake in the mid-day heat; and assails with taunts the seer, <lb/>
            wise Oecleides, that ‘ out of cowardice he is shrinking <lb n="370"/>
            before [the approach of] death and battle.' Shouting such <lb/>
            words, he shakes three overshadowing crests, the hairy <lb/>
            plume of his helmet; and from beneath his shield bells of <lb/>
            wrought brass are making a terrifying din. And upon his <lb/>
            shield he bears a vaunting device as follows-a sky fashioned <lb/>
            ablaze with stars; and in the middle of the shield a brilliant <lb/>
            full moon, most august of the stars, the eye of Night, stands <lb/>
            out conspicuous. In such wild exultation, with armour of <lb/>
            boastful device, he is shouting on the river-bank;, longing <lb/>
            for the combat, like a horse fighting against the bit in his <lb/>
            impatience who chafes as he hears 2 the trumpet-call. Whom <lb n="380"/>
            wilt thou station to oppose this champion? Who, when <lb/>
            the bolts of the gate of Proetus are withdrawn, can be trusted <lb/>
            to defend it?</p>
          <p>Eteocles. At no man's fancy costume shall I be frightened. <lb/>
            Your devices make no wounds: crests and bell hurt not <lb/>
            without a spear-thrust. And as for this Night glittering <note type="footnote"> 1 els Person. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Reading provisionally <foreign xml:lang="grc">κλύων</foreign> Tyrrwhit [<foreign xml:lang="grc">μένων</foreign> M.]. </note> <lb/>

            with stars which thou sayest occupies the sky upon his <lb/>
            shield, perhaps the conceit1 may prove prophetic to one I <lb/>
            know. For if in death night descends upon his eyes, then <lb n="390"/>
            to him that bears it this high-vaunting device will prove <lb/>
            itself rightly and correctly named, and he himself shall make <lb/>
            this insolence prophetic against himself. Now against Tydeus <lb/>
            I will station the brave son of Astacus here, as defender of <lb/>
            the gate,-a man of right noble birth who worships the <lb/>
            throne of Honour and detests arrogant speech; for idle in <lb/>
            mean actions, but no coward, is he wont to be; and from <lb/>
            the Sown Heroes, they whom Ares spared, his stock is <lb/>
            sprung, and truly a native of this soil is he,—Melanippus. <lb n="400"/>
            The issue will Ares with his dice determine. Justice how- <lb/>
            ever, his near kinswoman, makes him her champion to keep <lb/>
            off the foeman's spear from the mother who bore him.</p>
          <p>Chorus. May the gods grant that our champion gains the <lb/>
            victory, who in a just cause speeds forth to fight for his city. <lb/>
            Yet I fear on behalf of my friends to look on deaths by <lb/>
            bloodshed.</p>
          <p>Messenger. To him may the gods so grant to be victorious. <lb/>
            But at the Electran gate Capaneus is stationed by lot; a <lb n="410"/>
            giant this man—taller than the one before mentioned ;-and <lb/>
            his boasting words betoken thoughts unsuited to a mortal, <lb/>
            and he threatens terrible things (which may the gods not <lb/>
            bring to pass!) against our defences; for he declares that, <lb/>
            whether Heaven wills it or wills it not, he will sack our <lb/>
            town, and not even the wrath of Zeus striking down upon <lb/>
            the plain in his path shall restrain him. Lightning flashes <lb/>
            and thunderbolts he compares to the warmth of the noon- <lb/>
            tide sun. And he bears for device a naked man carrying <lb/>
            fire, and a torch ready for action is blazing in his hands;<lb n="420"/>
            and in letters of gold he announces, ' I will burn the city.' <lb/>
            To a man like this do thou send-who shall engage with <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἡ</foreign> ’<foreign xml:lang="grc">ννοία</foreign> Dindorf [<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἡ ἀνοία</foreign> M.]. </note> <lb/>

            him, who shall abide without a tremor so vaunting a <lb/>
            warrior ?</p>
          <p>Eteocles. To this advantage of ours1 [in his over- <lb/>
            confidence] yet another is added [in his impiety].2 Of a <lb/>
            foolish mind surely his own tongue is true evidence against <lb/>
            a man. Capaneus utters threats, prepared to carry them <lb/>
            out,-and, slighting the gods as he exercises his tongue in <lb/>
            foolish exultation, sends, though a mortal, swelling words <lb/>
            ringing up to Zeus,—yet am I confident that against him <lb n="430"/>
            will justly come the fiery thunderbolt in no way to be <lb/>
            compared to the warmth of the noontide sun. And against <lb/>
            him, for all his insolence of speech, is ranged a champion <lb/>
            fiery of spirit, stalwart Polyphontes,.one to be relied upon as <lb/>
            a guard, by favour of protecting Artemis and with aid of the <lb/>
            other gods. Tell of another that hath his post at some <lb/>
            other gate.</p>
          <p>Chorus. May he perish who makes great boasts against <lb/>
            our city, and may a thunderbolt restrain him ere he burst <lb n="440"/>
            into my chambers, or ever with insolent spear make havoc <lb/>
            of maiden bowers.</p>
          <p>Messenger. Hear then, I will tell of him that next in <lb/>
            order hath his station at the gates. The third for whom <lb/>
            the lot leapt forth from the upturned helm was Eteoclus, <lb/>
            that he should lead his company against the gate of N eïs. <lb/>
            And he is wheeling to and fro his mares snorting in their <lb/>
            headgear, willing to meet their death at the gate; and, <lb/>
            in barbaric fashion, the nose-bands filled with breathings <lb n="450"/>
            from the nostrils of his steeds are making a whistling sound. <lb/>
            And his shield is blazoned in no mean style :-a man in <lb/>
            armour is ascending the steps of a scaling-ladder to an <lb/>
            enemy's tower, seeking to storm it. And this one too in a <note type="footnote"> 1 Or (with Blomfield), ‘ In the case of this man too advantage is <lb/>

            string of letters cries that, ‘Not even Ares shall dash him down <lb/>
            from the defences.' So against this one do thou send <lb/>
            him who can be trusted to keep the yoke of slavery from <lb/>
            this town.</p>
          <p>Eteocles. I will send at once this man here : and with <lb/>
            good luck 1 ... There now he is sent on his way, bearing <lb n="460"/>
            his boast in his hands, Megareus—the seed of Creon of the <lb/>
            race of the Sown-who will go forth from the gate no whit <lb/>
            alarmed at the noise of the snortings of excited horses; but <lb/>
            either in death will pay in full his debt of nurture to the <lb/>
            land, or having captured two men and the citadel upon the <lb/>
            shield will deck with trophies his father's house. Tell me <lb/>
            of the vauntings of another of them. Spare me nothing in <lb/>
            thy tale.</p>
          <p>Chorus. Hail, 0 champion of our homes! I pray that our <lb/>
            side may be victorious, and that defeat may be the portion <lb/>
            of our foes. Even as with frenzied mind they shout <lb/>
            boastful threats against the city, so may Zeus the avenger<lb n="470"/>
            look upon them in wrath.</p>
          <p>Messenger. Another, fourth in order, having as his post <lb/>
            the neighbouring gate of Onca Athena, is taking station <lb/>
            by it with a shout,-the form and mighty bulk of <lb/>
            Hippomedon. And at the mighty orb—I mean the circle <lb/>
            of his shield—I shuddered, as he twirled it: I will not <lb/>
            speak beside the truth. And no mean artificer was the <lb/>
            contriver of the device, who wrought upon the shield a <lb/>
            work of art 2 as follows:—Typhon sending forth from his <lb n="480"/>
            fire-breathing mouth black smoke, flickering sister of flame; <lb/>
            and the rim running round the convex boss of the shield is <lb/>
            made solid all round with coils of snakes. And the warrior <lb/>
            himself raises ever and anon a shout, and inspired by Ares <lb/>
            is wildly raving like a Maenad for the fray, glaring terribly. <note type="footnote"> 1 There is a lacuna, probably of several lines, at this place. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Cf. Theocritus xv. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="92"/>
            The enterprise of such a man must be well guarded against; <lb/>
            for panic is being already boastfully predicted at the gate.</p>
          <p>Eteocles. In the first place Onca Pallas, as having her <lb/>
            abode near the city hard by the gate, loathing the warrior's <lb/>
            insolence will keep him away, as it were a dangerous snake,<lb n="490"/>
            from her brood. And Hyperbius, stout son of Oenops, has <lb/>
            been chosen as a champion against yon champion, willing <lb/>
            enough to discover what fate [he may expect] of Fortune 1 <lb/>
            in time of need,-a man not to be despised either in form <lb/>
            or spirit or in the fashion of his equipment. And with <lb/>
            good reason did Hermes pair them; for hostile is our hero <lb/>
            to the champion with whom he will engage, and they twain <lb/>
            will bring into conflict gods [depicted] on their shields who <lb/>
            are hostile to each other. For the one bears [as device] <lb/>
            fire-breathing Typhon, and Hyperbius has father Zeus, stand- <lb/>
            ing upright, planted upon the shield, making his thunder- <lb n="500"/>
            bolt blaze in his hand; and no one, I think, yet saw Zeus <lb/>
            vanquished. Such then is the favour of the divinities on <lb/>
            both sides, we are on the side of the conquerors, they on that <lb/>
            of the conquered. And, inasmuch as Zeus was conqueror <lb/>
            of Typhon in battle, it is likely that the men opposed to each <lb/>
            other will fare even as [the gods they bear]; and for <lb/>
            Hyperbius, in conformity with his device, may Zeus prove <lb/>
            a protector.</p>
          <p>Chorus. I have full confidence that he who bears on his <lb/>
            shield the unloved form of the under-world divinity who <lb/>
            strove against Zeus, a presentment detestable to man-<lb n="510"/>
            kind and to the long-lived gods, will leave his head in <lb/>
            front of our gate.</p>
          <p>Messenger. May it prove so. I tell next of the fifth, who <lb/>
            received the fifth station at the Borraean gate, over <lb/>
            against the tomb of Zeus-born Amphion. He vows by <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐξιστορη̑σαι μοι̑ραν τύχης</foreign> =<foreign xml:lang="grc">δαίμονος πειρα̑σθαι</foreign>.Choeph. 511, AS- <lb/>

            the spear which he carries, having the hardihood to <lb/>
            reverence it more than any god and as more precious than <lb/>
            his eyes, that surely he will sack the Cadmean city in spite <lb/>
            of Zeus. Such is the speech of the handsome-faced off- <lb/>
            spring of a mountain-nurtured mother, a youth with a man's<lb n="520"/>
            spirit; and whiskers are just coming on his cheeks, his time <lb/>
            of life producing them, thick hair growing up. And he, <lb/>
            fierce in spirit that recalls not a maiden's name, and with <lb/>
            grim countenance, stands nigh. Not indeed without a <lb/>
            vaunting device does he station himself at the gate. On <lb/>
            his bronze-wrought shield, the rounded defence of his body, <lb/>
            he was swinging a Sphinx fastened to it with rivets, she <lb/>
            that eats men raw, the reproach to our city, a shining <lb/>
            figure hammered out from within. And beneath her she <lb/>
            carrying one of the Cadmeans, so that most shafts are<lb n="530"/>
            launched against this man. And now that he is come it is <lb/>
            likely he will be no petty trafficker in battle,-nor bring <lb/>
            discredit on his long journey hither,—Parthenopaeus of <lb/>
            Arcadia. A man of such quality is he, who has left his <lb/>
            country and in repayment to Argos for her care in rearing <lb/>
            him to comely manhood is threatening against these towers <lb/>
            things which may Heaven not accomplish.</p>
          <p>Eteocles. Yes, for if they obtain from Heaven what they <lb/>
            design against us, with those impious vaunts of theirs, in <lb/>

            much modesty and valiant in combat, a seer,-the doughty <lb/>
            Amphiaraus. Stationed at the Homoloïan gate he<lb/>
            shouting repeatedly at the stalwart Tydeus with reproaches <lb/>
            as, ' the murderer, the troubler of the city, greatest teacher <lb/>

            ing the name at the end [of his speech], he calls thy brother <lb/>
            Poly-nices: and from his mouth utters these words :-Is a <lb/>
            deed like this acceptable to the gods and honourable for <lb/>
            those who come after to hear and relate, an attempt to sack <lb/>

            for death but not dishonour. Such words spoke the seer, <lb/>
            handling his rounded shield of bronze; and upon its circle <lb/>
            there was no device, for his wish is, not to appear, but to <lb/>

            man I advise thee to send an opponent wise and brave. <lb/>
            Formidable is he who reverences the gods.</p>
          <p>Eteocles. Alas, for the luck which in mortal affairs <lb/>
            associates the just man with the impious ! In every under- <lb/>
            taking nothing is worse than evil company: there no fruit <lb/>
            is to be gathered. The [field of] infatuate daring has death <lb/>
            produced as its harvest. Indeed a righteous man, embarked <lb/>
            on a ship as associate of reckless sailors and some criminal<lb n="590"/>
            act, has ere now perished with the Heaven-detested crew. <lb/>
            Or again, a just man associated with churlish citizens who <lb/>
            forget the gods falling himself, in spite of his merits, into <lb/>
            the same snare with them, has ere now been laid low by the <lb/>
            scourge of Heaven that visits all alike. Even so the seer, I <lb/>
            mean the son of Oecles, a man modest and just and brave and <lb/>
            righteous, a prophet of renown, through his association with <lb/>
            impious men of unbridled tongues, who are going a long march <lb/>
            in despite of reason, shall by Zeus' will be dragged down with <lb/>
            them to reach that far-off city. I think indeed that he will<lb n="600"/>
            not even assault the gate, not as being wanting in courage 1 <lb/>
            or from cowardice of spirit; but he knows in what fashion <lb/>
            he is to meet his death in combat, if the divine warnings of <lb/>
            Loxias bear fruit. And Loxias is wont either to keep <lb/>
            silence, or to speak what is to the point. Yet will I station <lb/>
            one to oppose him, the stalwart Lasthenes, a guardian of <lb/>
            the gate surly to strangers. He shows a mature mind, <lb/>
            though a youthful frame; a man of2 swift-glancing eye, <lb/>
            and as to his hand,-he is not slow to snatch the naked<lb n="610"/>
            spear from alongside the shield. But a man's good fortune <lb/>
            is the gift of Heaven.</p>

            now tell of, thine own brother, the fate that he vows and <lb/>
            prays for to befall our city. Standing upon the towers and<lb n="620"/>
            having been proclaimed King to the whole land, raising in <lb/>
            triumph a shout as over a captured city, [he vows] to engage <lb/>
            with thee and having slain thee to die near by; or, if he lives, <lb/>
            punish thee, as one who 2 dishonoured him by driving him <lb/>
            from his home, with banishment in the same fashion as a <lb/>

            upon the gods of his family to see to the full accomplishment <lb/>
            of his prayers. And he carries a handy buckler, newly <lb/>
            wrought, and a device of two figures attached to it by<lb n="630"/>
            rivets :-a Man in semblance of a warrior in beaten gold a <lb/>
            Woman is leading, preceding him with modest gait. She <lb/>
            declares herself to be Justice, as the letters announce, [with <lb/>
            the legend], ‘ I will restore this man from exile, and he shall <lb/>
            have his city and the range of his ancestral home.' Of such <lb/>
            nature are the inventions of our foes. Do thou thyself now <lb/>
            decide whom to send forth : for in regard to the present <lb/>
            speaker thou wilt never find reason to complain of his <lb/>

            we shall soon know for certain in what that device of his <lb/>
            will result: whether gold-wrought letters on his shield idly <lb/>
            bragging in company with wandering of mind will bring him <lb/>
            from exile. Had Justice, virgin daughter of Zeus, been <lb/>
            companion of his deeds and mind, that would perhaps have <lb/>
            come to pass. But neither when brought forth to light by<lb n="650"/>
            his mother, nor in his growth, nor when he reached youthful <lb/>
            manhood, nor at the first harvest of a bearded chin, did <lb/>
            Justice ever regard him or admit him to her presence; nor <lb/>
            yet will she, I think, stand by to aid him in this evil treat- <lb/>
            ment of his own land,—she who would falsely be named <lb/>
            Justice if she associated with one of so reckless a mind. <lb/>
            In this have I full confidence, and will engage with him<lb n="660"/>
            myself: what other has the better fight ?-prince with <lb/>
            prince and brother with brother, foe with foe, I shall <lb/>
            engage. Bring my greaves at once, my defences against <lb/>
            point and stone.</p>
          <p>Chorus. Child of Oedipus, most dear to us, prove not <lb/>
            thyself like in temper to him that hath the worst of names. <lb/>
            No! let it suffice that Cadmean warriors do battle with <lb/>
            Argive; for blood so shed may be expiated. But of warriors <lb/>
            who are brothers death thus inflicted by each other's hands <lb/>
            -of pollution such as this there is no decay.</p>
          <p>Eteocles. If indeed a man may suffer a wrong without <lb n="670"/>
            dishonour, then let it be so: that alone counts as gain among <lb/>
            the dead. But of wrongs which involve disgrace, thou wilt <lb/>
            find no glory to tell of.</p>
          <p>Chorus. Child, for what art thou fain ? Let not wrathful <lb/>

            thee the beginnings of desire for evil.</p>

            the whole race of Laius that is abhorred of Phoebus.</p>

            blood forbidden to thee.<lb n="680"/>
            </p>
          <p>Eteocles. Aye, for nigh to me sits in anger the black 1 curse <lb/>
            of my dear father with dry tearless eyes, telling me of gain <lb/>
            which ranks before death which counts for less.</p>
          <p>Chorus. But do not thou be hasty. Thou wilt not <lb/>
            be called cowardly, since thou hast ordered thy life well <lb/>
            [ until now]. Erinys of dark aegis will go from the house <lb/>
            when the gods receive propitiatory offerings at thy hands.</p>
          <p>Eteocles. By the gods we are already it seems made of no <lb/>
            account, and the favour they pay regard to is the favour of <lb/>
            our death. Why then should we shrink before our fatal doom?<lb n="690"/>
            </p>
          <p>Chorus. [Seize the occasion] now when [doom] stands <lb/>
            near at hand; since Fortune may yet 2 come with a fresher <lb/>
            breeze in thy favour, shifting with a change or thy disposition <lb/>
            made at the last moment, although now she is still stormy <lb/>
            against thee.</p>
          <p>Eteocles. [Stormy indeed] for the curses of Oedipus have <lb/>
            broken out in fury. Too true were the visions assigning <lb/>
            the division of our ancestral wealth, that appeared in dreams <lb/>
            by night.</p>
          <p>Chorus. Yield to women, although thou dislikest to do so. <lb/>
            Eteocles. Let something be said of which the doing is <lb/>
            possible. No need of a long speech.<lb n="700"/>
            </p>
          <p>Chorus. Go not thou on this errand [to station thyself] <lb/>
            at the seventh gate.</p>
          <p>Eteocles. Now that I am whetted for the contest, thou <lb/>
            wilt not blunt me with thy talk.</p>
          <p>Chorus. Yet is there a victory, even if it means defeat, <lb/>
            which the gods hold in honour.</p>
          <p>Eteocles. It is not for a man who bears arms to approve <lb/>
            such a saying. <note type="footnote"> 1 Reading provisionally <foreign xml:lang="grc">μέλαιν</foreign>’ <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀρὰ</foreign> Weil [<foreign xml:lang="grc">τελει̑ ἀρὰ</foreign> M. ]. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 <foreign xml:lang="grc">αὖ τροπαία̨</foreign> Paley [<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀντροπαι̑α</foreign> M.]. </note></p><pb n="99"/>

            to his children is urging them on.</p>
          <p>A Chalybian stranger is apportioning their shares, coming <lb/>
            from his Scythian home as a fatal distributer of possessions, <lb/>
            -the cruel steel, which hath allotted to them so much <lb/>
            land to dwell in as they occupy in death, [deciding that] <lb n="720"/>
            they share not between them the broad plains.</p>
          <p>When by each other's hand they shall have perished by <lb/>
            mutual wounds, and the dust of earth hath drunk the dark- <lb/>
            clotted blood of their slaughter, who can bring purification ? <lb/>
            who is to cleanse them [of their guilt] ? 0 fresh troubles of <lb/>
            the house mingling with ancient ill-fortune !</p>
          <p>Of ancient origin I say was the transgression so swiftly <lb/>
            avenged. To the third generation it remains, ever since <lb n="730"/>
            Laius in defiance of Apollo, after that the god had three <lb/>
            times announced at the Pythian oracle at the centre of <lb/>
            earth that by dying without offspring he would1 preserve <lb/>
            the State, yet over-persuaded by the foolish advice of those <lb/>
            dear to him did beget his own destruction, Oedipus the son <lb/>
            who slew his sire: even he who dared to sow the sacred <lb/>
            field of his mother where he himself was fostered with a <lb/>
            root [prolific of] bloodshed. It was aberration of mind that<lb n="740"/>
            brought to wedlock the insensate pair.</p>
          <p>And, as it were, a surge of ills carries them along; one <lb/>
            sinking, then it raises another with triple crest which <note type="footnote"> 1 The present infinitive represents the historic present habitual in <lb/>

            little substance, but wealth of traders when too densely <lb/>
            packed causes wholesale throwing overboard [of cargo].</p>
          <p>For what man did the gods and his fellow-citizens and <lb/>
            the thronged meetings of men so reverence as in days <lb/>

            the land the ravening goddess of death ?</p>
          <p>But when he came to true knowledge, unhappy man, of <lb/>
            his wretched marriage unable to bear his woes he wrought <lb/>
            in his misery with frenzied heart a double mischief. With <lb/>
            the hand that slew his sire, he deprived, himself of his eyes <lb/>
            dearer than his children,</p>
          <p>And let loose against his children a curse, in anger at the <lb n="770"/>
            maintenance they afforded him—bitter-tongued curses alas! <lb/>
            even that they should divide his possessions with hands <lb/>
            that settled their shares by the steel. And now I tremble <lb/>

          <p>Messenger. Even in this was their Fortune common to <lb/>
            both. Of itself it now makes an end indeed of a luckless <lb/>
            race. Such are the reasons we have to rejoice and to <lb/>

            Inspired [by grief], I compose a dirge for the grave, now <lb n="820"/>
            that I hear of their corpses dripping blood by evil fate thus <lb/>
            dead. Ill omened indeed was their concert of spears.</p>
          <p>It worked to fulfilment, nor did it relax-that solemn <lb/>
            utterance from a father's lips; and the resolves of Laius <lb/>
            due to his want of faith have had effect till now. Anxiety <lb/>
            remains as to the city; for divine warnings do not lose <lb/>
            their potency. Ah! ye whom we bewail, this that we<lb n="830"/>
            never looked for have ye done, and lamentable grief has <lb/>
            come out of all reason.</p>

          <p>Here now all is plain of itself. What the messenger told <lb/>
            is now before our eyes. Twofold is our grief, double the <lb/>
            evil fortune they have brought upon themselves, double the <lb/>
            fated calamity now fulfilled. What shall I say? What <lb/>
            else than that trouble is in the house ? Come, dear ones, <lb/>
            as the breeze of sorrow carries us along, wave your hands <lb/>
            about your heads as ye escort the dead, in rhythmic move- <lb/>

            the occasion. Us it behoves to sing, before their voice is <lb/>

            I weep for you and wail; and it is no guile to say that <lb/>

          <p>O misguided men, who would not be persuaded by your <lb n="860"/>

            fraught with disaster to your house.</p>
          <p>O ye who overthrew the walls of your home, and came to <lb/>
            the sight of a fatal kingship, now are ye reconciled by <lb/>
            recourse to the steel.- The awful curse of your father<lb n="870"/>
            Oedipus wrought a fulfilment true in deed. Stricken through <lb/>
            the left, sides, aye, stricken through sides born of a common <lb/>
            mother, alas! thou wondrous ones; alas! for the curses <lb/>
            resulting in death by each other's hand.-A home-thrust to <lb/>
            house and body was [the blow] whereby thou sayest they <lb/>

            </p>
          <p>Through the city too there goes a sound of wailing; the <lb/>

            whilst the possessions through which came strife, through <lb/>

          <p>Herald. It is my office to announce what by the chief <lb/>
            advisers of the city of Cadmus has been, and is, decreed. <lb/>
            Eteocles yonder, for his friendship towards this country, it <lb/>
            is resolved to bury with loving interment in the earth ; for it <lb/>
            was in striving to keep out the foe that he got his own death<lb n="1000"/>
            at this city. Pure in respect of the shrines of his ancestors <lb/>
            and free from blame, he is dead [on the field of battle] <lb/>
            where 'tis honourable for a young man to die. Thus with <lb/>
            respect to him is it enjoined upon me to proclaim. But <lb/>
            this man's brother, the dead body yonder of Polynices, [it <lb/>
            is resolved] to cast out unburied, a prey to dogs, as one that <lb/>
            would have been destroyer of the Cadmean, town unless <lb/>
            some divinity had stood in the way of his spear; and even <lb/>
             <pb n="107"/>
            in death he shall have [the brand of] guilt in respect of his <lb/>
            ancestral gods, without regard for whom he sought to take <lb/>
            this city by launching against it a band of mercenaries. So <lb n="1010"/>
            it is decreed that he shall receive his reward by being buried <lb/>
            in unseemly wise by the fowls of the air; and there shall <lb/>
            attend him neither raising of a mound by hand nor shall any <lb/>
            show him respect with loud strains of mourning, but he <lb/>
            shall be without honour of burial by his friends. Such is <lb/>
            the decree of the Cadmean authority.</p>
          <p>Antigone. Aye, but this have I to say to the Cadmean <lb/>
            authorities :- Though none other consent to aid me in <lb/>
            burying this man, I myself will bury him, and will undertake <lb/>
            the risk of burying my own brother; nor am I ashamed <lb/>
            at incurring [the reproach of] disobedience that refuses <lb n="1020"/>
            submission to the State. A mighty influence is the common <lb/>
            blood whence we are sprung, from an unhappy mother and <lb/>
            an ill-fated sire. Willingly, therefore, for one who would not <lb/>
            have willed it so, does my heart-the living for the dead- <lb/>
            take a share in his misfortunes in sisterly spirit. His flesh <lb/>
            never shall empty-bellied wolves gorge upon. Let no one <lb/>
            think it. For I, though but a woman, will of myself contrive <lb/>
            a tomb and [means of] interment for him, carrying [earth] <lb n="1030"/>
            in the bosom of my linen robe, and with my own hands will <lb/>
            cover him. Let no one think the contrary. To my courage <lb/>
            a plan will occur that will prove effective.</p>
          <p>Herald. I give thee notice not to act in defiance of the <lb/>
            State in this matter.</p>
          <p>Antigone. I give notice to thee not to make useless pro- <lb/>
            clamations to me.</p>
          <p>Herald. Yet the people is severe, now that it has escaped <lb/>
            danger.</p>
          <p>Antigone. Talk as you will of severity. This man shall <lb/>
            not be deprived of burial.</p>
          <p>Herald. But wilt thou honour one whom the city hates ?</p><pb n="108"/>
            
          <p>Antigone. Yes, for his condition is not beyond honour in <lb/>
            the sight of the gods.</p>
          <p>Herald. It was not so, before he brought his country <lb/>
            into danger.</p>
          <p>Antigone. Having suffered wrong, he was but requiting it <lb/>
            with wrong. <lb n="1040"/>
            </p>
          <p>Herald. But against all the citizens, instead of against <lb/>
            one man only, was this enterprise of his directed.</p>
          <p>Antigone. Contention is the last of the goddesses to make <lb/>
            an end of her tale. But I shall bury this man. Spare thy <lb/>
            speeches.</p>
          <p>Herald. Well, be self-willed ; but I forbid thee to do it.</p>
          <p>Chorus. Alas, alas ! 0 high-vaunting fatal Furies, ruiners <lb/>
            of the race, who have thus destroyed root and branch the <lb/>
            stock of Oedipus! what is to be my fate, what am I to do ? <lb/>
            What shall I attempt ? How shall I endure neither to <lb n="1050"/>
            bewail thee, nor escort thee to the tomb ? Yet am I afraid, <lb/>
            and would fain avoid having dread of my own citizens. <lb/>
            Thou indeed shalt find many to be thy mourners; but he <lb/>
            there shall go unwept for, having only the single voice of a <lb/>
            sister's lament. Who is there would so far yield obedience ?</p>
          <p>Semi chorus. Let the city punish those who mourn for <lb/>
            Polynices, or let it not; for we here will go as his escort,<lb n="1060"/>
            and aid in burying him. For this grief is shared by all his <lb/>
            race, whereas the city approves, now one way of justice, <lb/>
            now another.</p>
          <p>Semi chorus. And we will go with this one here, as the <lb/>
            city and justice join in approving. For, next to the <lb/>
            Blessed Ones and the might of Zeus, this was he who <lb/>
            chiefly rescued the Cadmean city from being overwhelmed, <lb/>

          <p>King. Disclose to me his name also without grudging.</p>
          <p>Chor. Aegyptus. And now, knowing our descent of old, <lb/>
            act I pray thee so as to restore2 a band which is from <lb/>
            Argos.</p>
          <p>King. You appear, certainly,3 to belong originally to this <lb/>

            sorrow. For who ever dreamed that kindred, native once, <lb/>

            the rudder, that guides her at the ship's extremity, too well <lb/>

            dawn.</p>
          <p>The watchman undiscovered on the flat roof of the palace. <lb/>
            During the tenth year of the war, in which it had been <lb/>
            prophesied that Troy should fall, he had been set to watch for <lb/>
            the beacon to be passed from Troy by Agamemnon as the sign <lb/>
            of victory. It is now about the setting of the Pleiads (v. 817), <lb/>
            which marked the winter or storm-season (<foreign xml:lang="grc">χειμών, χει̑μα</foreign>, v. 5).</p>

            from this weary task throughout the space of a whole year's <lb/>
            watch; in which, while couched upon the Atreidae's roof <lb/>
            dog-fashion on my arms, I have become familiar with the <lb/>
            general gathering of the stars by night, and chief those <lb/>
            splendid potentates pre-eminent in the sky, the great stars1 <lb/>
            that bring winter and summer upon earth-the seasons of <lb/>
            their waning and the risings of them.</p>
          <p>And so now am I watching for the torch-signal, a blaze <lb/>

            an antidote compounded against sleep, I have a mind to <lb/>
            sing or hum a tune, then does my voice break to sighing <lb/>

          <p>So was it then with the elder leader of the Achaean fleet; <lb/>
            cavilling not at any prophet, letting his spirit yield to <lb/>
            violent circumstance,-what time the Achaean folk were <lb/>

            men distraught, and squandering ships and cables, doubling <lb/>
            the time of their sojourn, so that they wore the flower of <lb/>
            Argos painfully away; and the prophet, alleging Artemis <lb/>
            as cause, had cried out for the cruel storm a remedy more <lb/>
            grievous to the princes than the storm itself, so that they <lb n="210"/>
            struck their staves upon the ground and could not refrain <lb/>
            from tears,-then was it that the elder prince uttered voice <lb/>
            and said : " A grievous ill it is not to consent, and grievous <lb/>
            too if I must slay my child, the jewel of my home, defiling <lb/>

            is right that homage should be rendered to the consort of a <lb/>

            another on; Ida to Hermes' ridge in Lemnos, and from <lb/>

            sun, his golden radiance to the summits of Makistos. And <lb/>
            he was by no means tardy or heedlessly overcome by sleep, <lb/>
            to slack his duty; far over Euripus' flood his beacon light <lb/>
            arrived, giving signal2 to the watchers on Messapion. <lb/>
            They, setting "fire to a stack of old gray heather, lit up an <lb/>
            answering glare and passed the message further on: and <lb/>
            the blaze in vigour and undimmed leaped over, like the <lb/>
            shining moon, Asopus' plain, and coming to Cithaeron's <lb n="310"/>
            ridge aroused a fresh relief of missionary fire. The far- <lb/>
            sped light was not rejected by that station, which burned <lb/>
            more than their bidding;3 their light pitched beyond the <lb/>
            lake Gorgopis and arriving at mount Aegiplanetus urged the <lb/>
            fiery ordinance to make no tarrying; 4 and kindling up with <lb/>
            liberal ardour they sent onward a great beard of flame, that <lb/>
            it should pass right beyond the promontory that looks down <lb/>
            on the Saronic gulf, so blazing; then it pitched, when it had <lb n="320"/>

            again throughout, and satisfy my wonder at it. 330</p>
          <p>Clyt. This day the Greeks hold Troy. The town I guess <lb/>
            is loud with ill-according cries: pour into the same vessel <lb/>
            oil and vinegar, and you shall pronounce them unfriendly <lb/>
            separated; 2 and separate so, according to their different <lb/>
            case, may be heard the voices of the conquered and the <lb/>
            conquerors. The one upon the bodies flung of husbands <lb/>
            and of brothers, and on the bodies of their sons the aged <lb/>
            fathers that begat them, are bemoaning from a throat no <lb n="340"/>
            longer free the loss of their best loved: while the others <lb/>
            labour of night-roving after battle ranges hungry at such <lb/>
            breakfasts as the town affords-not after any billet in due <lb/>
            apportionment! 'tis even according to their several drawings <lb/>
            in Luck's lottery they are lodged now in their captive Trojan <lb/>
            dwellings, from the frosts and dews of the bleak open sky <lb/>
            delivered; and how blest!3 will sleep the livelong night <lb/>
            without a watch to keep.</p>
          <p>Now if they are showing due reverence to the gods- <lb n="350"/>
            those of the conquered land-and the holy places of the gods <lb/>
            then shall they not have spoiled only to be spoiled again. <note type="footnote"> ' to finish first,' and the play of words (which may have been familiar <lb/>
            in the case of torch-running) depends upon this ambiguity. The light <lb/>

            tombs in Ilian land-occupants hidden beneath a hated 460 <lb/>

          <p>A people's talk when in wrath is dangerous; it performs <lb/>
            the office of a curse publicly decreed. My anxious thought <lb/>
            awaits the news of something shrouded now in night:- <lb/>
            the Gods are not regardless of such as cause much blood- <lb/>
            shed ; when a man is prosperous unrighteously, the black <lb n="470"/>
            Erinyes by dwindling waste again of his substance cause <lb/>
            him to grow faint and dim; and when he is finally among <lb/>
            the vanished, there is no help then.</p>
          <p>Dangerous, moreover, is exceeding good report; for lofty <lb/>
            peaks are struck from heaven by jealous eyes of Zeus.1 <lb/>
            Good fortune free from envy is my choice: I would neither <lb/>
            be despoiler, nor yet be made captive myself to see my life <lb/>
            under the dominion of another.2 <lb n="480"/>

          <p>One of the Elders. Swift rumour has gone through the <lb/>
            city at good tidings brought by fire; but whether it be true <lb/>
            or not, who knows? Supposing it be not some divine <lb/>
            deceit.3</p>
          <p>Another. Who is so childish or so crazy as to let his <lb/>

          <p>Herald. 0 my dear fatherland, my native soil of Argos, <lb/>
            on this blessed day in the tenth year1 I have come back to <lb/>
            thee again, when many a hope hath snapped, successful in <lb n="510"/>
            this one; 2 I never thought that I should die in Argos here <lb/>
            and have my share of burial in this dearest land. Now at <lb/>
            last my blessing on the land, and blessed be the Sun's <lb/>
            light, and Zeus the land's most high, and blessed be the <lb/>

            and chiefly my own patron, Hermes the dear Herald, whom <lb n="520"/>
            heralds worship ; and to the Heroes that once sent us forth, <lb/>

            you and all this company together hath King Agamemnon <lb/>

            his due, since he hath levelled Troy with the mattock of <lb n="530"/>
            Zeus Justicer, whereby the soil hath been broken and the <lb/>
            seed of all the land destroyed.1 So heavy is the yoke upon <lb/>
            Troy's neck laid by our prince the elder son of Atreus, man <lb/>
            of blessed destiny, who now hath come; and who of all <lb/>
            men living is the worthiest to be honoured; for neither <lb/>
            Paris nor his associate people can profess that what they <lb/>
            did surpasses what they have suffered: cast in a suit for <lb/>
            rape and theft, he hath not only lost his plunder but hath <lb n="540"/>
            caused his fathers' house to be shorn off and utterly <lb/>
            destroyed with all the land pertaining; thus the sons of <lb/>

          <p>Elder. Herald of the allies returned from the field, I <lb/>
            wish you joy.</p>

            of God no more.</p>

          <p>Elder. It was a sweet disease, then, this that you had <lb/>

            the time in all, with part that one may call successful there <lb/>
            was part unsatisfactory-none but a god can live unhurt <lb/>

            and ....5 Then again our lot on shore was even worse; <lb/>

            drizzling from the sky and dews from the fenny earth <lb/>

              fate ? I think that our misfortunes may be fairly asked to <lb/>
              take a long farewell.1 For us, the remnant of the Argive <lb/>
              host, the gain outweighs, the suffering is no counterpoise; <lb/>
              so that we may well go flying over land and sea upon the <lb n="580"/>
              wings of fame this bright day boasting thus : 'By Argives, <lb/>
              having at last captured Troy, unto the Gods throughout all <lb/>
              Hellas were pinned up these trophies, to be a monumental <lb/>
              glory for their shrines.' Those that hear such doings should <lb/>
              applaud the country and the captains; and the grace of <lb/>
              Zeus shall be duly prized, as the achiever of this act.—You <lb/>
              have my tale in full.</p>
          <p>Elder. I am overborne, and yield with a good grace, for <lb/>
            docility keeps ever young.2-But this should most concern <lb n="590"/>
            the house and Clytemnestra, though enriching me at the <lb/>
            same time.</p>
          <p>Clyt. I lifted up my jubilant hymn before, a while ago, <lb/>
            when the first messenger arrived by night in fire, declaring <lb/>
            the capture and laying waste of Ilium; and they rebuked <lb/>
            me, saying, 'Art thou so persuaded by beacons to believe that <lb/>
            Troy is taken ? O like a woman to be so exalted I' This <lb/>
            was the language, arguing my wits abroad; yet I continued <lb/>
            offering, and throughout the town they raised the jubilant <lb n="600"/>
            anthem after woman's use, lulling in the shrines the spice- <lb/>
            fed odorous flame.</p>
          <p>So now, what need is there for thee to tell me all the <lb/>

            armed, bloodshed in double harness-when, I say, the <lb/>
            burden on his back is of that kind, then proper is it that the <lb/>
            hymn he utters should be this to the Erinyes:—but when <lb n="650"/>
            he comes with good tidings of preservation to a city blest <lb/>
            in the enjoyment of all happiness,-how then should I <lb/>
            commingle good with evil, speaking of a storm that came <lb/>
            upon the Achaeans surely through the wrath of Heaven ! <lb/>
            For Fire and Sea, the bitterest enemies before, now swore <lb/>
            alliance3 and displayed their compact by destroying the <lb/>

            in flower with corpses of our men and wreck of ships. We <lb/>
            however with our ship undamaged in the hull were either <lb/>

          <p>There is a venerable saying hath been framed on earth <lb/>
            of old, that human Weal, when come to the full growth, has <lb n="750"/>
            issue, and dies not childless; that Woe insatiable is the <lb/>
            natural heritage of good fortune.</p>
          <p>But my view is different from the world's and single: that <lb/>
            it is the sinful deed which begets more in the likeness of <lb/>
            his own kind, whereas righteous houses are ever blest in <lb/>
            their children.</p>
          <p>It is the wont of ancient Insolence to engender in the <lb n="760"/>
            evil-soon or late, when comes the appointed hour- <lb/>
            a youthful Insolence, in cloud of darkness an avenging <lb/>

            recklessness bringing black ruinous Doom upon the habita- <lb/>

          <p>But Righteousness doth shine in sooty dwellings, and <lb/>

          <p>Agam. My salutations are due first to Argos and the <lb/>
            Gods of the country, that have shared with me in my safe <lb/>
            journey and in justice I have wreaked upon the town of <lb/>
            Priam. Having heard the unvoiced cause, they cast into <lb/>
            the urn of blood, with no dissentient, their votes for perish- <lb/>
            ing and waste of Ilium; to the other vessel Hope of the <lb/>
            filling hand kept coming nigh, without fulfilment. The <lb/>
            capture of the city now remains still manifest by the smoke : <lb/>
            there is life yet in the gusts of Ate,1 and the ash expiring <lb n="810"/>
            with them puffs out rich breaths of wealth.</p>
          <p>For this should memorable reward be paid to the Gods; <lb/>
            seeing that we have taken vengeance for an arrogant rape <lb/>
            and for a woman's sake a city hath been laid desolate by a <lb/>
            fierce Argive monster, hatched by a Horse in form of <lb/>
            people armed, that made its spring about the sinking of the <lb/>
            Pleiades and leaping over the strong walls (like) a raw-fed <lb/>
            lion lapped its fill of despot's blood.</p>
          <p>This lengthened preface for the Gods : as for your senti- <lb n="820"/>
            ment, which I remember,—I agree; you have me of your <lb/>
            counsel: few are they with whom it is natural to admire a <lb/>
            friend's good fortune without jealousy; that bitter venom <lb/>
            settles at the heart making the diseased man's burden <lb/>
            double heavy: not only is he bowed beneath his own sore <lb/>
            load, but groans at the sight of prosperous ease in others. <lb/>
            With knowledge-for I am well acquainted with that glass, <lb/>
            companionship-I may pronounce ghost of a shadow certain <lb n="830"/>

            medicinal remedies, we shall endeavour to remove the <lb/>
            mischief by sage use of knife or searing-iron.-Now I will <lb n="840"/>
            proceed to my palace and my own home's hearth, to begin <lb/>
            with salutation to the Gods who sped me forth and have <lb/>
            brought me home again : may Victory, as she hath attended <lb/>
            me, remain still constant!</p>
          <p>Clyt. Good citizens, Council of Argos here before me, I <lb/>
            shall not blush to confess to you my loving disposition- <lb/>
            timidity wears away in time. It is not from others' prompt- <lb/>
            ing I shall speak now of my own unhappy life the whole <lb n="850"/>
            time that my lord here was absent before Ilium. In the <lb/>
            first place it is fearful hardship for a woman without man <lb/>
            to sit at home all solitary, her ears filled with malignant <lb/>
            rumours, and for one after another to come crying out <lb/>
            disasters for the house each worse than the last. Wounds, <lb/>
            -if my lord received as many wounds as rumour still in<lb n="860"/>
            conduit hither kept reporting, he must have perforations <lb/>
            in him past the number of a net :-or if his deaths had <lb/>
            been as numerous as the stories, he might have had three <lb/>
            bodies-Geryon the second-with an ample threefold <lb/>
            coverlet of earth to boast above him-never speak of that <lb/>
            beneath-one death for each several form ! In consequence <lb/>
            of such malignant rumours many a time by force against my <lb/>
            eager will2 have others loosened the suspended halter from <lb/>
            my neck. This is the reason that we have not standing by <lb/>
            our side here, as we should, the boy Orestes, who in his <lb/>
            person owns the pledges of love between us two: think it <lb n="870"/>
            not strange; he is in the keeping of our good ally, Strophius <lb/>
            the Phocian, who forewarned me of trouble on two accounts, <lb/>
            -thine own peril before Ilium, and the chance that popular <lb/>
            tumultuous anarchy might plot3 conspiracy against us, it <figure type="illustration">

              being natural impulse when a man is down to kick him <lb/>
              more :-this was the representation, carrying no guile in it.</p>
          <p>For myself, the welling springs of tears have run quite <lb/>
            dry, there is not a drop left in them; I have suffered injury <lb n="880"/>
            to my late-watching eyes through weeping for the still- <lb/>
            neglected lamps alight for thee: and in my dreams the <lb/>
            faintest wing-beats of a whining gnat would startle me while <lb/>
            I beheld more accidents to thee than could be in the time <lb/>
            that shared my sleep.</p>
          <p>Now at length after going through all this with unrepining <lb/>
            spirit I would hail my husband here as watch-dog of the <lb/>
            fold, preserving mainstay of the ship, firm-grounded pillar of <lb/>
            the lofty roof, a sole-born child appearing to a father, <lb/>
            land appearing to a sailor beyond hope!1 [Fairest is the <lb n="890"/>
            sight of daylight after storm, spring-water to the thirsty way- <lb/>
            farer, and sweet is the deliverance from all distress.] These <lb/>
            are the terms I use to do his merit honour; and let Envy <lb/>
            keep afar, for the troubles we have been enduring in time <lb/>
            past were plenty.-Now, dear my lord, step from that wagon, <lb/>
            -but not setting on the ground thy royal foot, the <lb/>
            vanquisher of Ilium!-Come, make haste, women, upon <lb/>

            while I still retain my senses, I make proclamation to <lb/>

            my mother, being my father's murderess, a thing unclean <lb/>
            and the abhorrence of the Gods. And for incentive to this <lb/>
            desperate act I hold in highest estimate the great prophet <lb/>
            of Pytho, with his oracle to me, that if I did this thing, I <lb/>
            should be clear of blame; but if I forwent it—I will not <lb n="1030"/>
            name the penalty, for no surmise can ever reach the full <lb/>

            exile for this act of kindred bloodshed; it was Loxias' <lb/>
            charge that I should turn for refuge to no other hearth than <lb/>
            that.</p>

            from the lake and ridge of Delos, landed at the havening <lb n="10"/>
            shores of Pallas, and came thence to this country and his <lb/>

            taming the wildness of the untamed land. And on his <lb/>

            and holding a drawn sword and a high-grown branch <lb/>

            wool-a silvery fleece, for on that point I will speak with <lb/>
            certainty.</p>
          <p>And before this man there sleeps a wondrous troop of <lb/>

            Phineus—but these are wingless, and black, and abominable <lb/>
            altogether. And they snore with blasts one cannot venture <lb/>
            near, and from their eyes there drips a loathsome rheum. <lb/>
            And their attire is such as is not fit to bring near statues <lb/>
            of the Gods, nor into homes of men. My eyes have never <lb/>

            testimony:-it is the law that the guilty suppliant should <lb/>
            keep silence until at purifying hands he hath been blooded <lb/>
            by the slaughter of a sucking swine. Long since have we <lb/>

            I am an Argive, and of my father it is well that thou <lb/>
            enquirest—Agamemnon, marshaller of men in ships, with <lb/>
            whom in concert thou didst make the city of Ilium to be no <lb n="460"/>

            well, on his returning home, for he was slain by my black- <lb/>
            hearted mother, who enveloped him in cunning trammels, <lb/>
            which bare witness to his murder in the bath.</p>
          <p>And I, returning,-having been before that time in exile, <lb/>

              that we miss then the article <foreign xml:lang="grc">ή</foreign>, which in this place sounds so good at <lb/>

              Hermes a new theft. To Hermes were ascribed the invention of the <lb/>

              of the six kinds known to the grammarians, I cannot find that he had <lb/>
              anything to do. The brazen trumpet, which was among the products <lb/>

          <p>Fur. Zeus, as you argue, holds a father's killing of the <lb/>
            more account; yet he himself cast his old father Cronos <lb/>
            into prison : is there not a contradiction there ?—I call <lb/>
            upon you judges to take note.</p>
          <p>Ap. 0 ye most loathsome monsters, Heaven's abhorrence! <lb/>
            fetters he might undo, there is a remedy for that, and many <lb/>
            a means of deliverance again; but when a man is once dead <lb n="650"/>
            and the dust hath swallowed up his blood, there is no more <lb/>

            turns upside down without his labour costing him a <lb/>

          <p>Ap. That too I will declare, and mark how rightly. The <lb n="660"/>
            mother is not the engenderer of her so-called 'generation' <lb/>

          <p>The mean between the ungoverned and the despot-ridden <lb/>

            not to banish from the city all restraint of fear,-for what <lb/>

            there is great harm done, and the cast of a single vote ere' <lb/>
