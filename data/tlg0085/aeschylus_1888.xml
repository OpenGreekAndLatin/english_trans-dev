          <p>THE following translation has been undertaken with th <lb/>
            view of presenting the classical student with a close and <lb/>
            literal version of Æschylus, and of furnishing the general <lb/>
            reader with a faithful copy of the Author's thoughts and <lb/>
            words, although the graces of poetic expression must be <lb/>
            sacrificed in a literal prose version.</p>
          <p>Ihe Translator gratefully acknowledges the help he has <lb/>
            derived from the labours of his predecessors, and trusts that <lb/>
            he will generally be found to have preferred the best render­ <lb/>
            in,- consistent with the ictter or the text. His object has not <lb/>
            been to exhibit an elegant though loose paraphrase, but to <lb/>
            render the version as close a verbal transcript of the original <lb/>
            as could be done without absolute violation of good taste.</p>
          <p>The best scholars of Germany and England have of late <lb/>
            combined the duties of the philologer with those of the <lb/>
            translator1, duties which ought never to have been separated. <lb/>
            The present Translator has attempted the same; but, as the <lb/>
            limits of the work rendered condensation imperative, his <lb/>
            aim has been rather to direct the inquiring student to sources <lb/>
            of information, than to enter at full length upon all the <lb/>
            difficulties of an author like Æschylus.</p>
          <p>The notes, with a few acknowledged exceptions, are ori­ <lb/>
            ginal, and will, it is hoped, prove useful in giving the student <lb/>
            some idea of the present condition of the text of Æschylus. <note type="footnote"> 1 See Coningtou's Preface to his translation of " The Agamemnon." </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="iv"/>
            If the Author shall seem on some occasions to have been <lb/>
            severe in his condemnation of particular views, it is not <lb/>
            from a disposition to underrate men far above him in repu­ <lb/>
            tation and attainments, but because their very superiority <lb/>
            lends a dangerous sanction to clever, but unsafe, sophistry.</p>
          <p>The translation is accommodated to the text of Dindorf, <lb/>
            except in such instances as this scholar’s own notes, or <lb/>
            the obvious necessity of alteration, warranted a change. In <lb/>
            all such instances, as in the translation of Sophocles lately <lb/>
            published, the reader is duly forewarned.</p>
          <p>In the " Supplices,” the Translator has confined his notes to <lb/>
            a mention of some necessary variations, and a few references <lb/>
            to the able notes of Mr. Paley, as he was by no means dis­ <lb/>
            posed to venture on the thankless task of commenting on <lb/>
            so corrupt a text, without long and careful re-examination <lb/>
            of the criticism thereof. Should an opportunity of publishing <lb/>
            the original text of Æsehylus oceur hereafter, he still thinks <lb/>
            that much may be done, bv moderate alteration, to render <lb/>
            the heavy accumulation of mystical interpretations unne­ <lb/>
            cessary.</p>
          <p>The introductory essay, like prefaces in general, may <lb/>
            require some apology. Matters of taste are an open question, <lb/>
            and if his remarks shall be thought not wholly devoid of <lb/>
            interest, the highest wish of the Author will be realized.</p>

          <p>ÆSCHYLUS, son of Euphoriou, was born at Eleusis, B.C. <lb/>
            525.. His early employment to watch the grapes in a vineyard <lb/>
            is traditionally reported to have led to the devclopement of his <lb/>
            tragic genius, and possibly to some less excusable propensities <lb/>
            of his character, in which the god Baccnus was equally con­ <lb/>
            cerned. He first appeared as a tragedian in B.C. 499, with <lb/>
            Chœrilus and Pratinas for his competitors. In B.C. 490, he <lb/>
            distinguished himself at the battle of Marathon, in company <lb/>
            with his brothers Cynegeirus and Ameinias. In B.C. 484, he <lb/>
            gained his first tragic victory, and in B.C. 480, he fought at <lb/>
            Salamis: thus, as Schlegel1 observes, “ he flourished in the very <lb/>
            freshness and vigour of Grecian freedom, and a proud sense <lb/>
            of the glorious struggle by which it was won, seems to have <lb/>
            animated him and his poetry." This warlike vein is con­ <lb/>
            spicuous in the “ Persæ” and “ Seven against Thebes," while <lb/>
            the " Agamemnon" is replete with pathetic illustrations of <lb/>
            the toils, dangers, and sufferings, of a soldier's life.</p>
          <p>His journeys into Sicily involve some intricate questions, <lb/>
            but the received opinion seems to settle his first visit in B.C. <lb/>
            4G8, immediately after his defeat by Sophocles, and he pro­ <lb/>
            bably spent some time there, if the use of Sicilian words in <lb/>
            his later plays may be adduced as an argument. The other <lb/>
            journey was probably ten years after, B.C. 458, and, as Müller <lb/>
            thinks, was undertaken in consequence of the aristocratic <lb/>
            notions so freely expressed in his " Eumenides," which wert <lb/>
            too openly opposed to the interests of Pericles' party, ther. in tIll <note type="footnote"> 1 Lect. vi. p. 80, ed. Bohn. </note> <note type="footnote"> b </note> <lb/>

            ascendant, to render Athens a safe abode for our poet Other <lb/>
            accounts state that a charge of impiety was the real cause of <lb/>
            his second departure, and that he only escaped the fury of the <lb/>
            populace, through the intervention of the Areopagus. His <lb/>
            death took place at Gela, B.C. 456. The story is, that an <lb/>
            eagle having mistaken his bald head for a stone, dropped a <lb/>
            tortoise upon it in order to break the shell, and that the blow <lb/>
            proved fatal. There seems, however, little doubt but that <lb/>
            our poet died in the ordinary course of nature, as his ad­ <lb/>
            vanced age would render probable.</p>
          <p>The number of plays written by Æschylus is doubtful, <lb/>
            but, as in the case of Sophocles, seven only have survived the <lb/>
            ravages of time. Among these seven we are fortunate In <lb/>
            possessing a complete trilogy, consisting of the " Agamem­ <lb/>
            non," “Choephoræ,” and “Eumenides.” The remaining <lb/>
            plays are the " Prometheus Bound," the “ Seven Chiefs <lb/>
            against Thebes," the " Persians," and the " Suppliants."</p>
          <p>In criticising the plays of Æschylus, due regard must be <lb/>
            had to the state in which Æschylus found the drama, and to <lb/>
            the difference between his earlier and later works, as far as <lb/>
            the existing specimens allow us to judge.</p>
          <p>When we are told that Æschylus formed the dialogue of <lb/>
            the Athenian stage, by adding a second actor, it is evident <lb/>
            that the preceding dramas must have consisted of little else <lb/>
            than a recitative and chorus alternately following each other. <lb/>
            The single actor probably detailed some legend possessing a <lb/>
            mythological or local interest, while the chorus relieved the <lb/>
            monotony by songs and dances connected with the subject. <lb/>
            If we consider the earliest specimens of our own drama, we <lb/>
            shall find the dialogue heavy, and consisting of long para­ <lb/>
            graphs, whilst the more modern stage limits these lengthy <lb/>
            speeches to narrative, argument, or soliloquy. But in the <lb/>
            "Suppliants" of Æschylus, (which some scholars consider <lb/>
             <pb n="vii"/>
            the most ancient specimen of the Greek drama that has <lb/>
            descended to us in a complete form,) we shall find that the <lb/>
            chorus are really the chief personages in the piece, and, as <lb/>
            AEschylus is considered to have limited the functions of the <lb/>
            chorus, it follows that the single actor was rather subservient <lb/>
            to carrying on the story, than the hero of it. And this agrees <lb/>
            with Aristotle's account, that Æschylus " introduced an actor <lb/>
            of first parts'," evidently shewing that the histrionic abilities <lb/>
            previously required in the actor were of an inferior order. <lb/>
            Throughout the whole play of the " Suppliants," the pathos <lb/>
            rests entirely with the chorus, the speeches of Danaus and the <lb/>
            king are quiet and didactic, and even the herald lacks the <lb/>
            haughtiness with which such persons are elsewhere invested. <lb/>
            Setting aside the chorus, the whole play exhibits a dead level <lb/>
            of moral common places and mythical details. It might <lb/>
            indeed be read and performed "with characters omitted." <lb/>
            As far as the corrupt state of the choruses will allow us to <lb/>
            judge, they were genial, brilliant, and graceful, but the very <lb/>
            nature of a chorus destroyed all individualisation. Their <lb/>
            griefs, joys, and emotions, were common to all their number; <lb/>
            there were so many heroines, that there was no heroine.</p>
          <p>There is another feature in the Supplices, which points to <lb/>
            its extreme antiquity, and that is, its undramatic character. In <lb/>
            the first chorus we are told as much as we know at the end <lb/>
            of the play. Like the prologues prefixed to the comedies of <lb/>
            Terence (unnecessary, as the plot is always the same), the <lb/>
            opening chorus contains the whole argument of the piece. <lb/>
            The Danaïdes have fled from Egypt to avoid the lawless love <note type="footnote"> 1 Twining has mistaken the sense of Poetics § IV., B., in translating <lb/>
            TOV <foreign xml:lang="grc">λόγον πρωταγωνιστὴν παρεσκεύασε</foreign>, " he made the dialogue the <lb/>
            principal part of tragedy." Pacius translates "sermonem primarum <lb/>
            partium instituit." Hermann and Ritter both take it to mean the actor, <lb/>
            and so Robortelli, in his learned commentary, p. 41, where the subject is <lb/>
            admirably illustrated. Dacier was more correct. </note> <note type="footnote"> <unclear>B</unclear> 2 </note> <lb/>

            of their kinsmen, they crave protection, are admonished to <lb/>
            behave themselves; they obtain protection, and, it is to be <lb/>
            hoped, follow their father's advice. There is, in fact, some­ <lb/>
            thing half comic in the whole story, and the effect could only <lb/>
            have been heightened by a concluding play in the trilogy (if <lb/>
            there was any1), in which their punishment should have been <lb/>
            so before the eyes of the spectator, with real tubs and real <lb/>
            water.</p>
          <p>After what has been said on the subject of the " Suppliants,” <lb/>
            the reader will perhaps be surprised to find that Schlegel <lb/>
            considers the " Persæ,” “ both in point of choice of subject, <lb/>
            and the manner of handling it, undoubtedly the most im­ <lb/>
            perfect of all the extant tragedies of this poet." Æschylus <lb/>
            certainly laboured under the same disadvantages as Lucan <lb/>
            and Silius Italicus, in having chosen a subject too near his <lb/>
            own time to possess a mythical interest, and too much de­ <lb/>
            pending upon narrative to be truly dramatic. But he suc­ <lb/>
            cessfully appealed to the feelings of the audience, who doubt­ <lb/>
            less listened to this panegyric upon Athens with as much <lb/>
            satisfaction as an English audience applauded the braggart <lb/>
            prologues " spoken upon occasion," during the last century. <lb/>
            There is too great a desire in German critics to elevate the <lb/>
            standard of Athenian refinement. The conclusion of the <note type="footnote"> I The subject of the trilogy is very uncertain, and Müller and Welcker <lb/>
            have probably told us much more on the subject than the Athenians <lb/>
            themselves knew. If the custom had been invariable, surely the dida­ <lb/>
            scaliæ would have told us something on the subject! Notwithstanding <lb/>
            the opinions of Schlegel, Lect. vi. and Müller, Literature of Greece, <lb/>
            XXIII. § 8, I do not believe that either the " Suppliants " or " Persians " <lb/>
            formed any part of a trilogy. Æschylus is said to have written either <lb/>
            no or 70 dramas. Neither of these numbers are divisible both by 4 and 3 <lb/>
            without a remainder. If the plays were always acted three or four at a <lb/>
            time. this would have been the case. Nor am I single in my opinion. <lb/>
            See F. Vater, Comm. de Æsch. Persis, in Neue jahrbucher für Pbilologie <lb/>
            und Pædagogik, Juli, 1843. </note> <lb/>

            " Persians " savours too much of ridicule, to excite any high <lb/>
            feelings of commiseration, and this play, like the “ Seven <lb/>
            against Thebes," ought to have ended soone .</p>
          <p>But in the episodes Æschylus has shown great power. The <lb/>
            prevailing notion throughout the play is of a deity favouring <lb/>
            the Athenians, and overthrowing the haughty yoke of the <lb/>
            Persians. The atheistic impiety of Xerxes is hinted at, and <lb/>
            his too-late repentance is an instance of the fatalism found <lb/>
            throughout the "Agamemnon," and pervading the Æschylean <lb/>
            drama. The piety of the Greeks, on the contrary, is power­ <lb/>
            fully contrasted, and the deity is accordingly represented as <lb/>
            “ beginning the fight." This description of the sea-fight is <lb/>
            wonderfully animated, and could be written only by an eye- <lb/>
            witness of the victory of Salamis, while the description of the <lb/>
            fate of the miserable remnants of the Persian army, as de­ <lb/>
            tailed by the messenger, is in the highest degree graphic.</p>
          <p>Nor was the evocation of Darius less pleasing to an Athe­ <lb/>
            nian mind. The ancient prophecies of Bacis and others, <lb/>
            which, although they might refer to mythical events, were <lb/>
            nevertheless greedily seized upon, and applied to the present <lb/>
            moment, and the recognition of ancient local traditions by <lb/>
            supernatural powers, was an agreeable sacrifice to the vanity <lb/>
            of the Athenians. Every man would have exclaimed with <lb/>
            Hamlet: <lb/>
            ———— Touching this vision here. <lb/>
            It is an honest ghost ——</p>
          <p>Nay, Æschylus has excited a feeling of pity for the defeat of <lb/>
            the Persians, by the amiable dignity with which he has in­ <lb/>
            vested the character of their former lord. The quiet, sub­ <lb/>
            stantial steadiness of Darius is the most powerful satire upon <lb/>
            the intemperance of their subsequent ruler that can be ima­ <lb/>
            gined, and the whole evocation is invested with a mystical <lb/>
            solemnity that makes uf forget its ideality.</p><pb n="x"/>
            
          <p>Many critics consider the “ Persians ” as the earliest of the <lb/>
            extant plays of Æschylus, but for the reasons above stated, I <lb/>
            am inclined to give the higher antiquity to the “ Suppliants."</p>
          <p>If the “ Seven against Thebes" was connected with the <lb/>
            “ Eleusinians," as Müller thinks, I scarcely believe that <lb/>
            Æschylus would have ended with an anticlimax, by intro­ <lb/>
            ducing the lamentations of Antigone and Ismena over their <lb/>
            fallen brothers. When this critic says, " this concluding scene <lb/>
            points as distinctly as the end of the Choephoræ to the subject <lb/>
            of a new piece, which was doubtless the Eleusinians1,’ " he <lb/>
            asserts too much. In the first place, it is clear from Plutarch <lb/>
            (Thes. p. 14, A.). that the burial of the chieftains was effected <lb/>
            by Theseus under a truce, not by violence. If, therefore, <lb/>
            matters were amicably arranged, why should Antigone be <lb/>
            “ closely connected with this subject.” The fact is. Muller <lb/>
            has told us a great deal that we do not know, but has over­ <lb/>
            looked the only point that Plutarch tells us respecting the <lb/>
            “ Eleusinians," which, unfortunately contradicts his whole <lb/>
            theory. We might as well say that the threats of the <lb/>
            Mycenian elders, at the end of the " Agamemnon,” neces­ <lb/>
            sarily required the " Choephoræ,” to open with their revolt, <lb/>
            as that, because Antigone threatens to bury her brother, <lb/>
            Æschylus was obliged to make her do so in another play, of <lb/>
            which all our knowledge only proves the contrary. The <lb/>
            theory of tetralogy has been carried much too far.</p>
          <p>The “ Seven against Thebes" is doubtless an early play, <lb/>
            and is as undramatic as the “ Persians." But the high tone <lb/>
            of true Grecian chivalry which reigns throughout, the splendid <lb/>
            individuality of the characters, despite their one common <lb/>
            feature of physical valour, is equal to anything, even in <lb/>
            Æschylus. The description of each warrior is not only a <lb/>
            physical and heroic, but an ethical picture The high-souled <note type="footnote"> - Lit. of Greece, p. 324. </note> <lb/>

            Amphiaraus, whose destiny led him to that death his wisdom <lb/>
            foresaw, whose fate impelled him to that society his sense <lb/>
            shrunk from, is pathetically contrasted with the mad boldness <lb/>
            of the other chieftains.-his religion with their impiety-his <lb/>
            modesty with their idle vaunting—his wisdom with their <lb/>
            recklessness. And when Eteocles praises him, we almost <lb/>
            forget that he too lies under the ban of fate. So good does <lb/>
            Eteocles seem by his praise of the good.</p>
          <p>In allusion to the question of a connexion between dramas, <lb/>
            it may be worth while to observe the different degrees of <lb/>
            fatalism that influence the minds of the two brothers in this <lb/>
            play, and in the “ (Edipus at Colonus " of Sophocles. Poly­ <lb/>
            nices, in the latter play, is presented to us as the heart- <lb/>
            broken fugitive, the wandering victim of a father's curse, <lb/>
            softened by misfortune, and seeking to palliate the wrath of <lb/>
            his destiny. But in the Eteocles of JEschylus, there is no <lb/>
            compunction. He remembers the curse of his aged sire, <lb/>
            and speaks even with affection of the man who had banned <lb/>
            his lawless life by a paternal anathema. But he seeks not <lb/>
            to avert the doom. Stern, uncompromising, he will meet <lb/>
            the man he must slay, by whom he must himself fall. Still, <lb/>
            as Sophocles has softened the character of Polynices till he <lb/>
            almost obtains our pity, so has Æschylus heightened that of <lb/>
            Eteocles with sentiments of temperate prudence and un­ <lb/>
            daunted courage, till he deserves it; and in this respect both <lb/>
            have exemplified the precept of Aristotle1. <lb/>
            shall now proceed to the consideration of the “ Prome­ <lb/>
            neus,” the sublimest poem, and simplest tragedy of antiquity. <lb/>
            1 have one motive in doing so, in reference to that great triad <lb/>
            of tragedies, the “ Oresteia," and that is to show the similar <lb/>
            aristocratic spirit that pervades the whole of the four plays. <note type="footnote"> Poetics, § XIII. 15, and in § XI. 5, he enumerates oĩ<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐν τῳ̃ φανερῳ̃ <lb/>

            The Titan majesty of mankind had been infringed by the <lb/>
            new gods of Olympus, and Prometheus appeared as their <lb/>
            protector, the assertor of their rights. Opposed to a new <lb/>
            aristocracy, he was still the supreme power of the old one. <lb/>
            In the true spirit of the old aristocracy he laboured for the <lb/>
            benefit of his weaker dependants. The Olympian gods, like <lb/>
            the parvenus of Aristotle1, are everywhere represented as <lb/>
            oppressing mankind, and each other. Moreover, Prometheus <lb/>
            represents the intellectual ascendancy of mankind over the <lb/>
            creation, the power of moral progress in opposition to phy­ <lb/>
            sical strength and conventional resources. The imprudence <lb/>
            of Jove is hereafter to destroy that power, in the haughtiness <lb/>
            of which he had thought fit to spurn the god of wisdom from <lb/>
            him. Much as I am disinclined to allegorical interpreters <lb/>
            and interpretations, much as I dislike the tediousness of an <lb/>
            Eustathius or the barbarism of a Fulgentius, still the “Pro­ <lb/>
            metheus" of Æschylus cannot but seem a magnificent imper­ <lb/>
            sonation of mind struggling against circumstances, intellect <lb/>
            against force, providence against fate. And the very fatalism <lb/>
            of this play is pleasing. Unlike the gloomy demon that <lb/>
            lurks over the ill-fated house of Mycenæ, unlike the Fates <lb/>
            that but exchange death for revenge, Prometheus is ever <lb/>
            cheered by the triumphant prospect before him. As he <lb/>
            foresaw his present troubles, so he even names the time of <lb/>
            their termination. His very philanthropy, his inability to do <lb/>
            further good, force from him the groan of the hero, but, as <lb/>
            the good man meets death, so does he meet pain—conscious <lb/>
            that there is something yet to come.</p>
          <p>The introduction of Io is perfctly agreeable to Aristotle's <lb/>
            idea of Episode, and enables us to learn the deeds of Pro­ <lb/>
            metheus, and to test his powers of prescience. Moreover, <lb/>
            Prometheus and Io are both victims to the power of Zeus, <note type="footnote"> I Cf. Rhet. II. 9, 9. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="xiii"/>
            both await their relief from his downfall. The pathetic <lb/>
            description of Io’s fall, her exclusion from the home of her <lb/>
            sorrowing sire, her phantom-stricken wanderings over earth <lb/>
            and sea, are all depictured with a power that proves how <lb/>
            Æschylus could touch the tenderest, as well as the most lofty <lb/>
            emotions of the human soul.</p>
          <p>Muller has entered, with some ability, iuto the question of <lb/>
            the discrepancy between the character of Zeus as pourtrayed <lb/>
            in this play, and in the later works of our poet. I grant that <lb/>
            the tyrannical Zeus of this play is unlike the mild potentate, <lb/>
            "who guides men in the ways of wisdom1,” or the great <lb/>
            Zeus in heaven2," whose aid the fatherless may implore with <lb/>
            confidence against their oppressors, but I do not see the <lb/>
            necessity of reconciling the inconsistency. If Æschylus could <lb/>
            create a conception, he might also depart from it. Zeus was <lb/>
            as necessarily the tyrant in the Titan world, as he was the <lb/>
            mild governor of things in the heroic ages. But Müller has <lb/>
            rightly observed, that this discrepancy is partly reconciled by <lb/>
            the fact that Prometheus everywhere appears in the light of <lb/>
            an offender against the " powers that be," too proud to reve­ <lb/>
            rence Adrasteia. Like Antigone, he is relatively guilty, In <lb/>
            offending against ruling authorities; like her, he is abstract­ <lb/>
            edly right. The sin of both is the sin of time and place, not <lb/>
            of principle.</p>
          <p>Shelley, whose whole poetry is deeply imbued with the <lb/>
            mysterious power of AEschylus, has imitated the imagery of <lb/>
            this play with a success proving that a man must be a poet <lb/>
            to truly appreciate Æschylus. It is to be regretted that this <lb/>
            true genius, (like Knowles, so often disgraced by imitators.) <lb/>
            never translated any productions of the Greek drama, with <lb/>
            the single exception of the Satyric “ Cyclops " of Euripides. <lb/>
            He has invested his Prometheus with all the placid grandeur <note type="footnote"> ■ Again. 176. </note> <note type="footnote"> 2 Soph. El. 175. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="xiv"/>
            of the deity, all the tenderness of the good man. To say that <lb/>
            he imitates, in the modern sense, is to say nothing-to feel <lb/>
            that the spirit of Æsehylus has passed into the mind of <lb/>
            Shelley, is the fairest praise that can be awarded. But the <lb/>
            picturesque scenery of Shelley's painting is the marvellous <lb/>
            feature of the play. The Indian Caucasus, with its ice-bound <lb/>
            rocks, and gloomy prospect of the world spread beneath it; <lb/>
            the sea, " heaven's ever-changing shadow," and the giant, <lb/>
            grotesque glaciers, lost in the dim, chilled atmosphere, form <lb/>
            a picture that the mind of Æschylus could conceive, but the <lb/>
            hand of the Grecian painter could not imitate. But circum­ <lb/>
            stantial comparison will lead us too much away from the <lb/>
            main subject. The legend of Prometheus lives in the poetry <lb/>
            of Æsehylus and Shelley. The power of one poet can scarcely <lb/>
            be measured but by the equality of the other.</p>
          <p>The mention of scenery suggests a question of much æsthetic <lb/>
            interest, namely, how far the Athenian artist could realise <lb/>
            the conceptions of the poet. In the " Prometheus " such an <lb/>
            attempt must have been a failure. Setting aside the question <lb/>
            of the place of Prometheus' suffering, the poetry draws upon <lb/>
            larger resources than the Athenian scene-painter could have <lb/>
            possessed. The architectural delineations of the fronts of <lb/>
            palaces and other buildings, which usually formed the scene <lb/>
            of the drama, were easily executed, and in a country pos­ <lb/>
            sessing the finest models for imitation, were doubtless unsur­ <lb/>
            passed for effect and correctness. But the occasional land­ <lb/>
            seape paintings on the periaktoi must have been rude, and <lb/>
            even grotesque. The most finished frescoes we possess arc <lb/>
            totally devoid of any attempt to realise nature, the fragments <lb/>
            of encaustic paintings are confined to the human form, and <lb/>
            such objects as require no perspective; and if we regard the <lb/>
            paintings of the earliest Florentine artists, which sprung <lb/>
            from the imitation of the latest Greek, improved by Cimabue, <lb/>
             <pb n="xv"/>
            Giotto, and a few others, we shall find nothing to justify the <lb/>
            supposition that the Greeks ever attained to any excellence <lb/>
            in landscape painting. The knowledge of aërial perspective, <lb/>
            upon which all the realization of the "Prometheus" would <lb/>
            depend, is scarcely three centuries old, and if we consider <lb/>
            how long our own stage wanted such scenic accessories, we <lb/>
            cannot be surprised at the deficiency of the Greeks. The <lb/>
            decorations of the Athenian stage were probably confined to <lb/>
            costume and architectural embellishment. Moreover, the <lb/>
            fact that the plays were always represented in the day-time <lb/>
            must have robbed them of all the exquisite illusion pro­ <lb/>
            duced by the use and combinations of artificial lights. Such <lb/>
            being the case, how great was the power of the poet, who <lb/>
            could so successfully place nature before his hearers by words <lb/>
            only!</p>
          <p>The testimony of the didascalia shows that the " Agamem­ <lb/>
            non," " Choephorae," and " Eumenides," were performed at <lb/>
            the same time, together with a satyric drama called the Pro­ <lb/>
            teus. We are, therefore, justified in considering them as <lb/>
            forming a trilogy, although I doubt whether the “Oresteia1” <lb/>
            is a fit name for the trilogy, when Orestes is only indirectly <lb/>
            mentioned in the first and principal play. Nor is the con­ <lb/>
            nection between the three plays so exact as that which exists <lb/>
            in the " King CEdipus," " CEdipus at Colonus," and " Anti­ <lb/>
            gone " of Sophocles, which we know did not form a trilogy. <note type="footnote"> I Mr. Burges, who is a clever, but too universal enemy of trilogy, <lb/>
            has well remarked, in an article in .. The Surplice," March 7, 1816, <lb/>
            that, from the words of Euripides (in Arist. Ran. 1122), <foreign xml:lang="grc">πρω̃τον δέ <lb/>
            μοι τὸν ἐξ Ὀρεστείας μέγε</foreign>, he must have meant only a single play, as <lb/>
            Æschylus could not otherwise know which of the three was meant. The <lb/>
            substitution of <foreign xml:lang="grc">τιν</foreign>’ for <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸν</foreign> would meet this objection; but I am more <lb/>
            disposed to consider, with Mr. Burges, that the title of Oresteia belonged <lb/>
            to the Choephoræ alone. I do not, however, approve of his attempt to <lb/>
            get :id of the very name of trilogy. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="xvi"/>
            At all events, the thlee plays form the grandest dramatic <lb/>
            work of antiquity. It is true, we do not find the lights and <lb/>
            shades of character pourtrayed with the delicate finish of <lb/>
            Sophocles, nor is the character of Orestes invested with all <lb/>
            the interest of which it might seem capable. But Æschylus, <lb/>
            unlike the modern adaptors, who write a piece for two actors <lb/>
            in as many days, never sacrificed the play to enhance the <lb/>
            character. In a play like the " Prometheus," the hero was <lb/>
            necessarily the leading character; but in the Agamemno­ <lb/>
            nian history there were no less than four great characters,-- <lb/>
            Agamemnon, Orestes, Clytæmnestra, and Cassandra. Nor <lb/>
            are the minor parts of the Watchman, the Herald, and <lb/>
            Ægisthus, devoid of strongly marked individuality, while <lb/>
            Minerva, as Muller has remarked, may almost be considered <lb/>
            as the leading character in the “ Eumenides."</p>
          <p>This attention to the minor characters is almost peculiar to <lb/>
            Æschylus. In the extant dramas of Sophocles we every­ <lb/>
            where discover a greater amount of subordination to one <lb/>
            leading. feature, than elaborate filling out of the details. <lb/>
            Sophocles forms an abstraction, and not only embodies it in <lb/>
            the character of the hero, but sacrifices all surrounding objects <lb/>
            to the general conception. The leading character is the type <lb/>
            of a moral or religious principle; the subordinate ones are <lb/>
            but the means of argument and illustration. In the Æschy <lb/>
            lean trilogy the play, and not the hero, is the chief object of <lb/>
            the poet's attention. Each character is of weighty import, <lb/>
            each leads on the action, and each possesses marked and dis­ <lb/>
            tinct features that give vigour and freshness to every suc­ <lb/>
            ceeding scene. Moreover, Æschylus excites pity even for the <lb/>
            unworthy, by not representing them utterly destitute of bet­ <lb/>
            ter qualities. The Clytæmnestra of Sophocles has not one <lb/>
            redeeming trait, but Æschylus has found a partial excuse <lb/>
            for his heroine in the fated misfortunes of the house of <lb/>
             <pb n="xvii"/>
            Atreus; nor has he placed her illicit friendship for Ægis­ <lb/>
            thus in so odious a light as Sophocles has done. But the <lb/>
            finest point is in the conclusion of the play, when, suddenly <lb/>
            stricken with a sad consciousness, Clytæmnestra restrains the <lb/>
            mad rage of Ægisthus, and exclaims, <lb/>
            Enough of evil,-let no further stain imbrue our nands.</p>
          <p>Unlike Lady Macbeth, she has no wish to sacrifice a Banquo <lb/>
            to secure her victory. She is a proud, daring woman, but <lb/>
            her talents are unequalled. To compare her with Lady Mac­ <lb/>
            beth is, in some respects, a mistake. Semiramis and Lucreeia <lb/>
            Borgia are better parallels.</p>
          <p>Nor must we less admire the picture of ancient manners <lb/>
            which the " Agamemnon" presents to our view. Like <lb/>
            Rowena, Iphigenia had probably graced her father's table in <lb/>
            the capacity of Hebe. The third cup to the Preserver was <lb/>
            perhaps hallowed by the innocence of the cup-bearer. Like <lb/>
            the petted daughter of some Saxon chieftain, she could smile <lb/>
            away the remembrance of war and toil. Macaulay’s exqui­ <lb/>
            site portrait of Virginia gives a delightful idea of the re­ <lb/>
            lation between father and daughter in the rough, old times. <lb/>
            But the conjugal relations were different. The quiet, sensible <lb/>
            replies of Agamemnon to his enquiring spouse remind us of <lb/>
            Sir Halbert Glendinning's return, and, like Angelica in "Sir <lb/>
            Harry Wildair," Clytæmnestra might well complain of the <lb/>
            icy coldness of her spouse. It is the meeting of a king and <lb/>
            queen, and that is all. Shakespere, on the contrary, has <lb/>
            softened the character of Macbeth by traits of the most affec­ <lb/>
            tionate attention to his demon spouse. But if we remember <lb/>
            the company in which Agamemnon returned, we shall scarcely <lb/>
            be surprised.</p>
          <p>Cassandra may possibly be regarded as a second thought of <lb/>
            the poet So complete is the play without her, that we can <lb/>
             <pb n="xviii"/>
            easily imagine that the fertility of the poet's imagination <lb/>
            carried him on, when the play might otherwise not have <lb/>
            exceeded the rest in length. Be this as it may, the addition <lb/>
            is magnifieent. Power, terror, and pathos are alternately <lb/>
            blended in this wonderful scene. The weird boldness of the <lb/>
            language, the terrific personification of the ancient horrors <lb/>
            of the Atrean house, the changes from sad, sensible conscious­ <lb/>
            ness to inspired madness, render this scene the most wonder­ <lb/>
            ful of any on the Greek stage. A Siddons alone could aet <lb/>
            Cassandra. The pedantic poem of Lyeophron is a strange <lb/>
            contrast, and the imitations by Seneca equal even his worst <lb/>
            attempts. Virgil alone has approached equal sublimity in <lb/>
            his description of the Cumæan Sibyl.</p>
          <p>The time will I trust come, when the attempt to find an <lb/>
            esoteric meaning in poetry will be set at its proper value. <lb/>
            All the allegorizing absurdities of the Greeks themselves never <lb/>
            equalled the amount of dull nonsense that has been talked <lb/>
            and written concerning these plays. Can we believe that a <lb/>
            poet, whose mind was wholly possessed with his subject, whose <lb/>
            fiery, perturbed expressions almost struggled with each other <lb/>
            to unfold the exuberance of the mind that sent them forth ; <lb/>
            -can we suppose that lie would stop short in his course in <lb/>
            order to arrange an article or pronoun so as to convey a <lb/>
            hidden political or religious axiom? Can we suppose the <lb/>
            Athenians so unpractical as to trouble themselves to hunt <lb/>
            for such axioms, still less, to apply them ? The most careful <lb/>
            examination has convinced me that such allusions are always <lb/>
            broad and distinet, as in the " Persæ,” not obscure and un­ <lb/>
            intelligible, as the followers of Suvern generally seem to <lb/>
            suppose.</p>
          <p>Müller, who is much more learned, has likewise shewn <lb/>
            much greater taste in his examination of the " Eumenides." <lb/>
            Although 1 eannot at all times agree with him, yet his know­ <lb/>
             <pb n="xix"/>
            ledge is unquestionable, and his power of drawing inferences <lb/>
            tempered with good taste and judgment. The supposition <lb/>
            that the excitement caused by Ephialtes was alluded to in <lb/>
            this play has also occurred to Schlegel. and bears much <lb/>
            more appearance of probability than the generality of such <lb/>
            theories.</p>
          <p>I cannot, however, agree with Muller, that the action is <lb/>
            almost at a stand-still in the " Choephoræ.” There is not, <lb/>
            it must be admitted, such vehement progress as in the "Aga­ <lb/>
            memnon," but the discovery of Orestes by Electra, and the <lb/>
            catastrophe of the play, are well united by a continued series <lb/>
            of incidents, which, though trivial in themselves, lead 01 <lb/>
            gradually and naturally to the consummation. The chief <lb/>
            weakness of the play is in the character of Orestes. His <lb/>
            dreadful purpose might well cause some wavering in his <lb/>
            determination. Sent from the paternal home at an early age <lb/>
            he had not practically felt all his mother's cruelty, and some <lb/>
            lurking remains of tenderness for her might remain. But the <lb/>
            will of heaven pursues him. The terrors of disease, of cala­ <lb/>
            mity in every shape, the Nemesis of the dead, all threaten <lb/>
            him, should he swerve from his purpose. Like Ctesiphon in <lb/>
            " Ion," a father's murder calls upon him for revenge. I have <lb/>
            already touched upon the conclusion of the play, where <lb/>
            Orestes seems to express a degree of pity and compunction <lb/>
            over the body of Ægisthus. I am aware that many will think <lb/>
            the interpretation I have advocated rather too much for the <lb/>
            text. The mention of praise is so slight, that it may seem <lb/>
            scarcely enough to express the feelings I attribute to Orestes <lb/>
            But much might be done by the actor. Those who remember <lb/>
            Maeready's gesture and action in reading the few words <lb/>
            addressed to the slain Polonius,— <lb/>
            Thou wretched, rash, intruding fool, farewell! <lb/>
            1 took thee for thy betters :-take thy fortune! <lb/>
             <pb n="xx"/>
            will readily perceive what pathos might be thrown into the <lb/>
            brief speech of Orestes.</p>
          <p>To write upon the " Eumenides" after Müller, would be <lb/>
            almost a useless task. So completely has this great scholar <lb/>
            illustrated the spirit and allusions of this play, that the best <lb/>
            commentator can do little but praise, quote, and refer to the <lb/>
            German critic. It is difficult to say who is the chief per­ <lb/>
            sonage in the play. The incident certainly turns upon <lb/>
            Orestes, but there are so many different interests involved <lb/>
            throughout the piece, that till the conclusion, when all parties <lb/>
            are satisfied, we remain in suspense.</p>
          <p>I shall best conclude these remarks by expressing a hope <lb/>
            that my efforts to contribute to an acquaintance with Æschy­ <lb/>
            lus may not be deemed an entire failure. But I am painfully <lb/>
            aware how much must be effected, how much got rid of, before <lb/>
            we can congratulate ourselves on possessing Æschylus in a <lb/>
            state even approaching his original magnificence.</p>

          <p>STRENGTH. 1We are come to a plain, the distant boundary <note type="footnote"> I Lucian, in his dialogue entitled " Prometheus," or " Caucasus," has <lb/>
            given occasional imitations of passages in this play, not, however, <lb/>
            sufficient to amount to a paraphrase, as Dr. Blomfield asserted. Be­ <lb/>
            sides, as Lucian lays the scene at -Caucasus, he would rather seem to <lb/>
            have had the "Prometheus solitus " in mind. (See Schutz, Argum.) <lb/>
            But the ancients commonly made Caucasus the seat of the punishment <lb/>
            of Prometheus, and, as Æsehylus is not over particular in his geo­ <lb/>
            graphy, it is possible that he may be not altogether consistent with <lb/>
            himself. Lucian makes no mention of Strength and Force, but brings <lb/>
            in Mercury at the beginning of the dialogue. Moreover, Mercury is <lb/>
            represented in an excellent humour, and rallies Prometheus good-na­ <lb/>
            turedly upon his tortures. Thus § 6, he says, <foreign xml:lang="grc">εὔ ἔχει. καταπτήσεται <lb/>
            ἤδη και ὁἀετὁς ἀποκερω̃ν</foreign> TO <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἦπαρ, ώς πάντα ἔχοις ἀντι τη̃ς <lb/>
            καλη̃ς και εὐμηχανου πλαστικης</foreign>. In regard to the place where Pro­ <lb/>
            metheus was bound, the scene doubtless represented a ravine between <lb/>
            two precipices rent from each other, with a distant prospect of some of <lb/>
            the places mentioned in the wanderings of Io. (See Schutz, ibid.) But <lb/>
            as the whole mention of Scythia is an anachronism, the less said on this <lb/>
            point the better. Compare, however, the following remarks of Humboldt, <lb/>
            Cosmos, vol. ii. p. 140, .. The legend of Prometheus, and the unbinding </note> <note type="footnote"> B </note> <pb n="2"/>

            Sire imposed, be thy concern,-to bind this daring wretch2 <lb/>
            to the lofty-cragged rocks, in fetters of adamantine chains <lb/>
            that cannot be broken. For he stole and gave to mortals <lb/>
            thy honour, the brilliancy of fire [that aids] all arts8. Hence <lb/>
            for such a trespass he must needs give retribution to the <lb/>
            gods; that he may be taught to submit to the sovereignty of <lb/>
            Jupiter, and to cease from his philanthropic disposition.</p>
          <p>VULCAN. Strength and Force, as far as you are concerned, <lb/>
            the mandate of Jupiter has now4 its consummation, and there <lb/>
            is no further obstacle. But I have not the courage to bind <lb/>
            perforce a kindred god to this weather-beaten ravine. Yet <lb/>
            in every way it is necessary for me to take courage for this <lb/>
            task; for a dreadful thing it is to disregard5 the directions of the <lb/>

            me from my cruel bonds, and shall be willing to yield me <lb/>

            no respect hurt by the recital.</p>
          <p>PR. Painful indeed are these things for me to tell, and <lb/>
            painful too for me to hold my peace, and in every way <lb/>
            grievous. As soon as the divinities began discord, and <lb/>
            a feud was stirred up among them with one another,­ <lb/>
            one party1 wishing to eject Saturn from his throne, in order <lb/>
            forsooth that Jupiter might be king, and others expediting <lb/>
            the reverse, that Jupiter might at no time rule over the <lb/>
            gods :-then I, when I gave the best advice, was not able to <lb/>
            prevail upon the Titans, children of Uranus and Terra; but <lb/>
            they, contemning in their stout spirits wi y schemes, fancied <lb/>
            that without any trouble, and by dint of main force, they <lb/>
            were to win the sovereignty. But it was not once only that <lb/>
            my mother Themis, and Terra, a single person with many <lb/>
            titles, had forewarned me of the way in which the future <lb/>
            would be accomplished; how it was destined, that, not <lb/>
            by main force, nor by the strong hand, but by craft the <lb/>
            victors should prevail. When, however, I explained such <lb/>
            points in discourse, they deigned not to pay me any re­ <lb/>
            gard at all. Of the plans which then presented themselves <lb/>
            to me, the best appeared, that I should take my mother <lb/>
            and promptly side with Jupiter, who was right willing [to <lb/>
            receive us]. And 'tis by means of my counsels that the <lb/>
            murky abyss of Tartarus overwhelms the antique Saturn, <lb/>
            allies and all. After thus being assisted by me, the tyrant <lb/>
            of the gods hath recompensed me with this foul recom­ <lb/>

            upon what charge is it that he outrages me, this I will make <lb/>

            his honours, and he was marshalling in order his empire: <lb/>

            after having annihilated the entire race, to plant another new <lb/>
            one. And these schemes no one opposed except myself. But <lb/>
            I dared: I ransomed mortals from being utterly destroyed, and <lb/>
            going down to Hades. 'Tis for this, in truth, that I am <lb/>
            bent by sufferings such as these, agonising to endure, and <lb/>
            piteous to look upon. I that had compassion for mortals, <lb/>
            have myself been deemed unworthy to obtain this, but mer­ <lb/>
            cilessly am thus coerced to order, a spectacle inglorious to <lb/>
            Jupiter.</p>
          <p>CH. Iron-hearted and formed of rock too, Prometheus, is <lb/>
            he, who condoles not with thy toils: for I could have wished <lb/>
            never to have beheld them, and now, when I behold them, <lb/>
            I am pained in my heart.</p>
          <p>PR. Aye, in very deed I am a piteous object for friends to <lb/>
            behold.</p>
          <p>CH. And didst thou chance to advance even beyond this ?</p>
          <p>PR. Yes! I prevented mortals from foreseeing their <lb/>
            doom.</p>
          <p>CH. By finding what remedy for this malady?</p>
          <p>PR. I caused blind hopes to dwell within them.</p>
          <p>CH. In this thou gavest a mighty benefit to mortals.</p>
          <p>PR. Over and above these boons, however, I imparted fire <lb/>
            to them.</p>
          <p>CH. And do the creatures of a day now possess bright <lb/>

            many arts.</p>

            both visiting thee with indignities, and in no wise grants <lb/>
            thee a respite from thy pains? And is no period to thy toils <lb/>
            set before thee?</p>

          <p>Oc. I see, Prometheus, and to thee, subtle as thou art, I <lb/>
            wish to give the best counsel. Know thyself, and assume to <lb/>
            thyself new manners ; for among the gods too there is a new <lb/>
            monarch. But if thou wilt utter words thus harsh and whet­ <lb/>
            ted, Jupiter mayhap, though seated far aloft, will hear thee, <lb/>
            so that the present bitterness of sufferings will seem to thee <lb/>
            to be child's play. But, 0 hapless one, dismiss the passion <lb/>
            which thou feelest, and search for a deliverance from these <lb/>
            sufferings of thine. Old-fashioned maxims these, it may be <lb/>
            I appear to thee to utter; yet such become the wages of the <lb/>
            tongue that talks too proudly. But not even yet art thou <lb/>
            humble, nor submittest to ills ; and in addition to those that <lb/>
            already beset thee, thou art willing to bring others upon thee. <lb/>
            Yet not, if at least thou takest me for thy instructor, wilt <lb/>
            thou stretch out thy leg against the pricks; as thou seest that <lb/>
            a harsh monarch, and one that is not subject to control, is <lb/>
            lording it. And now I for my part will go, and will essay, <lb/>
            if I be able, to disenthral thee from these thy pangs. But be <lb/>
            thou still, nor be over impetuous in thy language. What! <lb/>
            knowest thou not exactly, extremely intelligent as thou art, <lb/>

            time cease to do so. For in zeal to serve me thou laekess <lb/>
            nothing. But trouble thyself not; for in vain, without being <lb/>
            of any service to me1, wilt thou labour, if in any respect thou <lb/>
            art willing to labour. But hold thou thy peace, and keep thy­ <lb/>
            self out of harm's way; for I, though 1 be in misfortune, would <lb/>
            not on this account be willing that sufferings should befal as <lb/>
            many as possible. No, indeed, since also the disasters of my <lb/>
            brother Atlas gall my heart, who is stationed In the western <lb/>
            regions, sustaining on his shoulders the pillar of heaven and <lb/>
            of earth, a burthen not of easy grasp. I commiserated too <lb/>
            when I beheld the earthborn inmate of the Cilician caverns, <lb/>
            a tremendous prodigy, the hundred-headed impetuous Typhon, <lb/>
            overpowered by force, who withstood all the gods, hissing <lb/>
            slaughter from his hungry jaws; and from his eyes there <lb/>
            flashed a hideous glare, as though he would perforce over­ <lb/>
            throw the sovereignty of Jove. But the sleepless shaft of <lb/>
            Jupiter came upon him, the descending thunderbolt breathing <lb/>
            forth flame, which scared him out of his presumptuous brava­ <lb/>
            does ; for having been smitten to his very soul he was crum­ <lb/>
            bled to a cinder, and thunder-blasted in his prowess. And <lb/>
            now, a helpless and paralyzed form, is he lying hard by a <lb/>

          <p>PR. Make mention of some other matter; it is by no means <lb/>

            concealment: for it is by keeping this secret that I am to <lb/>
            escape from my ignominious shackles and miseries.</p>
          <p>CH. Never may Jupiter, who directs all things, set his <lb/>
            might in opposition to my purpose, nor may I be backward <lb/>
            in attending upon the gods at their hallowed banquets, at <lb/>
            which oxen are sacrificed, beside the restless stream of my sire <lb/>
            Ocean; and may I not trespass in my words; but may this <lb/>
            feeling abide by me and never melt away. Sweet it is <lb/>
            to pass through a long life in confident hopes, making the <lb/>
            spirits swell with bright merriment; but I shudder as I <lb/>
            behold thee harrowed by agonies Incalculable .... For not <lb/>
            standing in awe of Jupiter, thou, Prometheus, in thy self-will <lb/>
            honourest mortals to excess. Come, my friend, own how <lb/>
            boonless was the boon ; say where is any aid ? What relief <lb/>
            can come from the creatures of a day ? Sawest. thou not the <lb/>
            powerless weakness, nought better than a dream, in which the <lb/>
            blind race of men is entangled ? Never shall at any time the <lb/>
            schemes of mortals evade the harmonious system of Jupiter. <lb/>
            This I learned by witnessing thy destructive fate, Prometheus. <lb/>
            And far different is this strain that now flits towards me from <lb/>

            or say, so as to perform what was well-pleasing to the <lb/>

            let him lord it for this brief span, e'en as he list, for not <lb/>
            long shall he rule over the gods. But no more, for I <lb/>
            descry Jove's courier close at hand, the menial of the new <lb/>

          <p>MER. With all that I have said I seem to be speaking to no <lb/>

            heart by entreaties, but art champing the bit like a colt <lb/>
            fresh yoked, and struggling against the reins. But on the <lb/>
            strength of an impotent scheme art thou thus violent; <lb/>

            which there is no escape, will come upon thee. For in the <lb/>
            first place the Sire will shiver this craggy cleft with thunder <lb/>
            and the blaze of his bolt, and will overwhelm thy body, <lb/>

            thou shalt have passed through to its close a long space of <lb/>
            time, thou shalt come back into the light! and a winged <lb/>
            hound of Jupiter, a blood-thirsting eagle, shall ravenously <lb/>
            mangle thy huge lacerated frame, stealing upon thee an un­ <lb/>
            bidden guest, and [tarrying] all the livelong day, and shalt <lb/>
            banquet his fill on the black viands2 of thy liver. To such <lb/>

            wreath of his fire be hurled at me, and æther be torn piece­ <lb/>

            rock earth from her base, roots and all, and with stormy surge <lb/>

            in the stern eddies of necessity. Yet by no possible means <lb/>
            shall he visit me with death.</p>
          <p>MER. Resolutions and expressions, in truth, such as these <lb/>
            of thine, one may bear from maniacs. For in what point <lb/>
            doth his fate fall short of insanity1 ? What doth it abate from <lb/>

            from this spot, lest the harsh bellowing of the thunder smite <lb/>
            you with idiotcy.</p>

            thou mayest prevail upon me ; for in this, be sure, thou hast <lb/>
            intruded a proposal not to be borne. How is it that thou <lb/>
            urgest me to practise baseness ? Along with him here I am <lb/>

            the sage seer, son of Oïcleus, with a taunt, [saying] that he is <lb/>
            crouching to both Death and Battle out of cowardice. Shout­ <lb/>
            ing out such words as these, he shakes there shadowy crests, <lb/>
            the hairy honours of his helm, while beneath his buckler bells <lb/>
            cast in brass are shrilly pealing terror: on his buckler too he <lb/>
            has this arrogant device,-a gleaming sky tricked out with <lb/>
            stars, and in the centre of the shield a brilliant full moon is <lb/>
            conspicuous, most august of the heavenly bodies, the eye of <lb/>
            night. Chafing thus in his vaunting harness, he roars beside <lb/>
            the bank of the river, enamoured of conflict, like a steed <lb/>
            champing his bit with rage, that rushes forth when he hears <lb/>
            the voice of the trumpet1. Whom wilt thou marshal against <lb/>

            blazonry has no power of inflicting wounds, and crests and <lb/>

            thou tellest me is sparkling on his buckler with the stars of <lb/>
            heaven, it may perchance be a prophet in conceit3; for if night <lb/>

            last. reproachfully dividing his name [into syllables1,] he calls to <lb/>
            him: and through his mouth he gives utterance to this speech <lb/>
            —" Verily such a deed is well-pleasing to the gods, and <lb/>
            glorious to hear of and to tell in after times, that you are <lb/>
            making havoc of your paternal city, and its native gods, having <lb/>
            brought into it a foreign armament. And what Justice shall <lb/>
            staunch the fountain of thy mother's tears? And how can thy <lb/>
            father-land, after having been taken by the spear through thy <lb/>
            means, ever be an ally to thee? I, for my part, in very truth <lb/>
            shall fatten this soil, seer as I am, buried beneath a hostile <lb/>
            earth. Let us to the battle, I look not for a dishonourable fall." <lb/>
            Thus spake the seer, wielding a fair-orbed shield, all of brass; <lb/>
            but no device was on its circle,-for he wishes not to seem <lb/>
            but to be righteous, reaping fruit from a deep furrow in <lb/>
            his mind, from which sprout forth his goodly counsels. <lb/>
            Against this champion I advise that thou send antagonists, <lb/>
            both wise and good. A dread adversary is he that reveres <lb/>
            the gods.</p>
          <p>ET. Alas! for the omen2 that associates a righteous man <lb/>
            with the impious !-Indeed in every matter, nothing is <lb/>
            worse than evil fellowship-the field of infatuation has <lb/>
            death for its fruits3. For whether it be that a pious man hath <lb/>
            embarked in a vessel along with violent sailors, and some vil­ <lb/>
            lany, he perishes with the race of men abhorred of heaven; <lb/>
            or, being righteous, and having rightly fallen into the same <lb/>
            toils with his countrymen, violators of hospitality, and un­ <lb/>
            mindful of the gods, he is beaten down, smitten with the <lb/>
            scourge of the deity, which falls alike on all. Now this seer, <lb/>

            he would have been the overturner of the land of Cadmus, if <lb/>
            some one of the gods had not stood in opposition to his spear: <lb/>
            and even now that he is dead, he will lie under the guilt of <lb/>
            pollution with the gods of his country, whom he having dis­ <lb/>
            honoured was for taking the city by bringing against it a <lb/>

          <p>The royal armament that makes havoc of cities, hath some <lb/>
            time sinee passed over to the adjoining opposite region, having <lb/>
            crossed the frith of Helle daughter of Athamas1, on a cable­ <lb/>
            fastened raft, after flinging a many-rivetted causeway by way <lb/>
            of yoke over the neek of Ocean. And against every land does <lb/>
            the impetuous lord of many-peopled Asia urge forward his <lb/>
            godlike armament in two divisions, of infantry, and of forces <lb/>

            a man equal to the gods of the raee that sprung from gold2. <lb/>

            gold-garnished mansion, the common bridal-dwelling both of <lb/>
            Darius and of myself. And anxiety is tearing me at heart: <lb/>
            and I will make a disclosure to you, my friends, being of my­ <lb/>
            self by no means free from apprehension, lest mighty wealth, <lb/>
            having made great speed, should, with his foot, overturn <lb/>
            the wealth which Darius reared, not without the aid of <lb/>
            some god. These things are to my soul a two-fold unut­ <lb/>
            terable care, not to honour with reverence a multitude of <lb/>
            riches unprotected by men, and that the light shines not <lb/>
            on those who are destitute of wealth, however great the <lb/>
            strength which they may possess. For our wealth at all <lb/>
            events is beyond the reach of censure, but touching our eye' is <lb/>
            my terrors. For I deem the presence of the master the eye <lb/>
            of an household. Whereupon, since these things stand thus, <lb/>
            lend me your counsel in this matter, ye aged trusty servants <lb/>
            of the Persians. For all my good measures depend on you.</p>
          <p>CH. Be well assured of this, 0 queen of this land, that thou <lb/>
            needest not to speak twice of either word or deed, to which <lb/>
            our ability can lead the way to completion. For thou sum­ <lb/>
            monest us who are well-affected to thee, as in these matters.</p>
          <p>AT. I have been continually haunted by many dreams in <lb/>
            the night, ever since my son, having fitted forth his armament, <lb/>
            went to the land of the Ionians, purposing to lay it waste. <lb/>
            But I never yet saw any so plain, as on the night just passed, <lb/>
            -and I will tell it thee. There seemed to appear before two <lb/>
            women2 in fair attire-the one robed in Persian vestments, <lb/>
            but the other in Doric, both in statue by far the most comely <lb/>
            of those who live now-a-days, and in beauty beyond rebuke, <lb/>
            and sisters of the same family. And as to eountry-they <lb/>
            inhabited, the one, having had it assigned to her by lot, the <lb/>
            land of Hellas,-the other the barbarian3; these two, as 1 <lb/>
            fancied I saw, had a feud the one with the other: and my <lb/>
            ion, when he heard it, was checking and soothing them, and <note type="footnote"> : i. e. Xerxes, as Blomfield, Linwood, and Paley rightly understand. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 This description of Atossa's dream has been imitated by Moschus in <lb/>

            he yokes them beneath his car, and places a collar on their <lb/>
            necks. And the one towered loftily in these trappings, and <lb/>
            had a tractable mouth in the reins: but the other kept <lb/>
            plunging, and tears in pieces with her hands the harness of <lb/>
            the car, and whirls it violently along without the bit, and <lb/>
            snaps the yoke in the middle: and my son falls, and his sire <lb/>
            Darius stands beside him, commiserating him ; and when <lb/>
            Xerxes sees him, he rends his robes about his person. These <lb/>
            things, indeed, I say that I beheld last night. But when <lb/>
            I had arisen, and had touched with my hands a fair-streaming <lb/>
            fountain!, I stood by the altar, wishing to offer a sacrificial <lb/>
            cake to the divinities that avert evil, to whom these rites <lb/>
            belong. And I behold an eagle fleeing to the altar of Phœbus; <lb/>
            and from terror I stood speechless, my friends, and afterwards <lb/>
            I see a falcon speeding onward in his course with his pinions, <lb/>
            and tearing his head with his talons. And the eagle did <lb/>
            nought but cower down and yield his body. These sights are <lb/>
            terrible for me to behold, and for you to hear. For be ye well <lb/>
            assured, my son, were he successful, would be a man worthy <lb/>
            of admiration, and though he fail, he is not liable to be called <lb/>
            to account by the state; but if he escape, will equally be <lb/>
            sovereign of this realm2.</p>
          <p>On. We wish not, 0 mother, either to terrify too much <lb/>
            by our words, or to cheer thee; but do thou, if thou hast <lb/>
            seen aught disastrous, approach the gods with supplications, <lb/>
            and implore of them to grant it may be averted, but that <lb/>
            what is favourable may be accomplished for thyself, and for <lb/>
            thy children, and for the city, and for all thy friends. And <lb/>
            in the second place it is proper that thou pour libations both <lb/>
            to the earth and to the departed. And gently make thy prayer <lb/>

            wretched Persians; for ill did they succeed in all things, alas 1 <lb/>
            when their host was destroyed.</p>
          <p>MES. 0 name of Salamis, most hateful to our ears. Alas ! <lb/>
            how I sigh when I remember Athens.</p>
          <p>CH. Hateful is Athens to us miserable: we have to re­ <lb/>
            member, in sooth, how many of the Persian matrons it has <lb/>
            made widows and bereft of their husbands to no gain of <lb/>
            ours!</p>
          <p>AT. I, wretched, have for a long time kept silence, utterly <lb/>
            astounded by the evils: for this calamity is too great for me <lb/>
            to speak, or to enquire about our sufferings. Nevertheless, <lb/>
            it is necessary for mortals to endure afflictions, when the gods <lb/>
            award them : and do thou compose thyself and tell us, unfold­ <lb/>
            in- the whole of our suffering, even though thou sightest over <lb/>
            the evils: who is there that hath not fallen ? and whom of <lb/>
            the leaders of the host shall we bewail, who, having been <lb/>
            appointed to a sceptred office, by his death left his file deso­ <lb/>
            late without their chief?</p>
          <p>MES. Xerxes himself lives, and beholds the light.</p>
          <p>AT. Thou tellest me of a great light to my house, and a <lb/>
            bright-dawning day after a night wrapped in gloom.</p>
          <p>MES. But Artembares, leader of a myriad of horse, is <lb/>
            dashed against the rugged shores of Sileniæ2. And Dadaces <lb/>
            the chiliarch, beneath the stroke of the spear, bounded a light <lb/>
            leap out of his vessel. Tenagon too, the true-born chieftain3 of <lb/>
            the Bactrians, haunts the sea-beat isle of Ajax. Lilæus, and Ar­ <lb/>
            sames, and Argestes third, overcome, keep butting against the <lb/>
            hard shore around the dove-breeding isle. Arcteus, too, that <lb/>
            dwelt near the sources of Egyptian Nile, Adeues, and Pheres­ <lb/>
            seues the third, Pharnuchus, these fell from one vessel. Matal­ <lb/>

            thousand black cavalry, in his death, tinged his bright auburn. <lb/>

            fifty ships, of Lyrnæan race, a hero of fair form, lies wretched, <lb/>
            having died by no means happily. And Syennesis, foremost <lb/>
            in gallantry, governor of the Cilicians, that with his single <lb/>
            arm occasioned much trouble to the foe, fell gloriously. Of <lb/>
            such of our leaders have I now made mention ; and I re­ <lb/>
            port a few of the many evils that have befallen us.</p>
          <p>AT. Alas ! Alas ! I hear these supreme of horrors, both <lb/>
            a disgrace to the Persians, and a subject for shrill shriek­ <lb/>
            ings. But turn back again and tell me this, how great was <lb/>
            the number of the ships of the Greeks, that they ventured <lb/>
            to join battle with the Persian armament in the encounter of <lb/>
            vessels ?</p>
          <p>MESS. So far as numbers are concerned, be well assured <lb/>
            that the barbarians had the advantage with their ships: for <lb/>
            the whole number of those of the Greeks amounted to ten <lb/>
            squadrons of thirty, and beside these there were ten of surpass­ <lb/>
            ing excellence2. But Xerxes, for I know this also, had a thou­ <lb/>
            sand, the number of those which he led: and those which <lb/>
            exceeded in swiftness were two hundred and seven: thus runs <lb/>
            report. Do we seem to you to have been inferior in fight in <lb/>
            this respect3 ? But 'twas some divinity that thus depressed <lb/>
            the balance with a counterpoise of fortune.</p>
          <p>AT. The gods preserve the city of the goddess Pallas4.</p>
          <p>MESS. The city indeed of Athens is still not laid waste, <lb/>
            for while there are men there is a sure bulwark.</p>
          <p>AT. And what was the commencement of the encoun­ <lb/>
            ter of the ships? Tell us; who began the fight, was it the <lb/>
            Greeks, or my son, elated by, the multitude of his ships ?</p>
          <p>MESS. It was some fiend, lady, or evil spirit appearing from <note type="footnote"> 1 The reader must consult the commentators, as many of these names are <lb/>

            some quarter or other that began all the mischief. For a <lb/>
            Greek that had come from the host of the Athenians1, told <lb/>
            thy son Xerxes this, that, when the gloom of murky night <lb/>
            should come, the Greeks would not remain, but, springing on <lb/>
            the benches of their vessels, would severally, in different direc­ <lb/>
            tions, save their lives by stealthy flight. And he, as soon as <lb/>
            he heard it, not aware of the stratagem of the Greek, nor ol <lb/>
            the jealousy of the gods, publishes this order to all his cap­ <lb/>
            tains, that when the sun should have ceased to illumine the <lb/>
            earth with his rays, and darkness tenant the temple of the <lb/>
            firmament, they should draw up the squadron of the ships in <lb/>
            three lines, to guard the outlets, and the murmuring passes of <lb/>
            the sea, and others in a circle around the isle of Ajax; so that <lb/>
            if the Greeks should elude fatal destruction, by discovering <lb/>
            any escape for their ships by stealth, it was decreed, that they <lb/>
            all should be deprived of their heads. To this effect he spake <lb/>
            from a frantic spirit; for he knew not that which was preor. <lb/>
            dained of the gods. And they, without disorder, and with <lb/>
            obedient mind, both provided supper for themselves, and the <lb/>
            mariner lashed his oar to the well-fitted rowlock. And when <lb/>
            the light of the sun had waned, and night had come on, every <lb/>
            man, master of an oar, went on board his ship, and every one <lb/>
            that had sway over arms ; and one line of ships of war cheered <lb/>
            on another line, and they make sail as each had been appointed, <lb/>
            and all the live-long night the commanders of the ships <lb/>
            were keeping the whole naval host occupied in sailing <lb/>
            about. And night withdrew, and the force of the Greeks by <lb/>
            no means made a stealthy escape in any direction. But when <lb/>
            Day, drawn by white steeds, had occupied the whole earth, of <lb/>
            radiance beautiful to behold, first of all a shout from the <lb/>
            Greeks greeted Echo like a song, and Echo from the island­ <lb/>
            rock at the same instant shouted forth an inspiring cry: and <lb/>
            terror fell on all the barbarians, baulked of their purpose; for <lb/>
            not as in flight were the Greeks then chaunting the solemn <lb/>
            pæan, but speeding on to the fight with gallant daring of soul. <lb/>
            And the trumpet, with its clang, inflamed their whole line; <lb/>
            and forthwith, with the collision of the dashing oar, at the <lb/>
            word of command they smote the roaring brine. And quickly <note type="footnote"> ' Sicinus. Cf. llerodot. VIII. 7G, and see Justin, II. 12. </note> <pb n="78"/>
            <note type="chapter"> 399—438 </note> <lb/>
            were they conspicuous to view. The right wing, well marshalled, <lb/>
            led on foremost in good order, and secondly, their whole <lb/>
            force was coming forth against us. and we could at the same <lb/>
            time hear a mighty shout: SONS OF THE GREEKS ! ON ! FREE <lb/>
            YOUR COUNTRY, AND FREE YOUR CHILDREN, YOUR ,VIVES, <lb/>
            THE ABODES TOO OF THE GODS OF YOUR FATHERS, AND THE <lb/>
            TOMBS OF YOUR ANCESTORS; NOW IS THE CONFLICT FOR <lb/>
            THEM ALL ! And sooth to say, a murmur of the Persian <lb/>
            tongue met them from our line, and no longer was it the <lb/>
            moment to delay, but forthwith ship dashed her brazen <lb/>
            prow at ship. And a Grecian vessel commenced the en­ <lb/>
            gagement, and breaks off the whole of the figure-head of a <lb/>
            Phoenician ship: and each commander severally directed his <lb/>
            bark against another of the enemy's. At first, indeed, the <lb/>
            torrent of the Persian armament bore up against them : but <lb/>
            when the multitude of our ships were crowded in the <lb/>
            strait, and no assistance could be given to one another, but <lb/>
            they were struck by their own brazen beaks, and were smash­ <lb/>
            ing their entire equipment of oars, and the Grecian vessels, <lb/>
            not without science, were smiting them in a circle on all sides, <lb/>
            and the hulls of our vessels were upturned, and the sea was no <lb/>
            longer to behold, filled as it was with wrecks and the <lb/>
            slaughter of men. The shores, too, and the rugged rocks <lb/>
            were filled with the dead ; and every ship, as many as ever <lb/>
            there were of the barbaric armament, was rowed in flight <lb/>
            without order. But the Greeks kept striking, hacking <unclear>us</unclear> as <lb/>
            it were tunnies, or any draught of fishes, with fragments of <lb/>
            oars, and splinters of wrecks; and wailing filled the ocean <lb/>
            brine with shrieks, until the eye of murky night removed it. <lb/>
            But for the multitude of our woes,-no, not if I should recite <lb/>
            them in order for ten days, could I complete the tale for thee. <lb/>
            For be thou well assured of this, that there never fell in a <lb/>
            single day a multitude of men of such number.</p>
          <p>AT. Alas! alas! a mighty ocean of ills has, in truth, <lb/>
            burst upon both the Persians and the entire race of the bar­ <lb/>
            barians.</p>
          <p>MESS. Be now well assured of this, that the evil hath not <lb/>
            yet reached its half. Such a visitation of ills hath come upon <lb/>
            them, as to overbalance these even twice over.</p>
          <p>AT. And what event can have befallen that is yet more <pb n="79"/>
             <note type="chapter">439—473 </note> <lb/>
            hateful than this ? Say what misfortune this is, which, thou <lb/>
            sayest, hath farther come upon the host, verging to greater <lb/>
            horrors.</p>
          <p>MESS. As many of the Persians as were in the very bloom <lb/>
            of life, most valiant in their spirit, and distinguished by their <lb/>
            high birth, and were ever foremost in faithfulness to our <lb/>
            monarch himself, have fallen foully by a most inglorious <lb/>
            doom.</p>
          <p>AT. Alas! the wretch that I am, my friends, by this <lb/>
            evil hap. And by what kind of doom sayest thou that these <lb/>
            of whom thou speakest perished ?</p>
          <p>MESS. There is a certain island lying off the shores of Sala­ <lb/>
            mis, small, a dangerous station for ships, which Pan, who <lb/>
            delights in the dance, haunts on its beach. Thither [Xerxes] <lb/>
            sends these men, in order that, when the foeman wandering <lb/>
            out of their ships should make their escape to the island, they <lb/>
            might slay the soldiery of the Greeks, an easy prey, and res­ <lb/>
            cue their comrades from the streams of the sea, ill knowing <lb/>
            of the future ; for when God gave the glory of the naval battle <lb/>
            to the Greeks, on that very day having fortified their bodies <lb/>
            in their armour well-wrought of brass, they leaped out of <lb/>
            their vessels, and encompassed the whole island around, so <lb/>
            that they were at a loss whither they should betake them­ <lb/>
            selves; for often were they smitten by stones from their <lb/>
            hands, and arrows falling on them from the bowstring do­ <lb/>
            stroyed them. And at last, having charged them with one <lb/>
            onslaught, they smite, they how in pieces the limbs of the <lb/>
            wretches, until they had utterly destroyed the life of all of <lb/>
            them. And Xerxes shrieked aloud, when he saw the depth <lb/>
            of his calamities; for he had a seat that afforded a clear <lb/>
            prospect1 of the whole armament, a high hill near the ocean <lb/>
            brine; and having rent his clothes, and uttered a shrill wail, <lb/>
            after issuing orders quickly to the land forces, he dismisses <lb/>
            them in disorderly flight. Such a misfortune is it thine to <lb/>
            wail over, in addition to the aforementioned.</p>
          <p>AT. 0 hateful demon! How hast thou then deluded <lb/>
            the Persians in their hopes. But bitter did my son find the <note type="footnote"> 1 Hemsterhuis is probably right in reading <foreign xml:lang="grc">εὐαυγὴς</foreign>, which Hesychius, <lb/>

            vengeance of renowned Athens, and those of the barbarians, <lb/>
            whom Marathon formerly destroyed, sufficed not, for whom <lb/>
            my son, thinking to exact atonement, drew1 upon himself so <lb/>
            great a multitude of sufferings. But say thou-those of the <lb/>
            ships which esaped destruction—where didst thou leave <lb/>
            them ? knowest thou so as to tell clearly ?</p>
          <p>MESS. The commanders of the ships, indeed, which were <lb/>
            left, tumultuously take to flight before the wind, not in gooc. <lb/>
            order. But the residue of the forces perished both in the <lb/>
            land of the Bœotians—some around the fountain spring suffer­ <lb/>
            ing from thirst, and some2 of us exhausted by panting, pass <lb/>
            on thence into the territory of the Phocians, and the land of <lb/>
            Doris, and the Melian bay, where Spercheius waters the plain <lb/>
            with kindly stream; and thence the soil of the Achaian land, <lb/>
            and the city of the Thessalians received us, straitened for want <lb/>
            of food: here, indeed, a great many perished both from thirst and <lb/>
            hunger; for both these evils befel us. We came also into the <lb/>
            land of Magnesia, and the country of the Macedonians, to the <lb/>
            ford of the Axius, and the fenny reed of Bolbe, and to mount <lb/>
            Pangæus, Edonian land. And in this night God called up <lb/>
            winter out of his season3, and congeals the whole stream of <lb/>
            the sacred Strymon. And one that had aforetime believed <lb/>
            not in the gods, then made prayer in orisons, doing reverence <lb/>
            to earth and heaven4. And after that the host had ceased <lb/>
            from offering their many invocations, it makes its passage <lb/>
            across the ice-bound stream. And whosoever of us had sped <lb/>
            our way before the rays of the god had been shed abroad, bath <lb/>
            escaped; for the bright orb of the sun blazing with his beams, <lb/>
            penetrated through the middle of the stream, warming it with <lb/>
            its blaze. They fell, too, one upon another; and happy, in <lb/>
            sooth, was any that most speedily broke off the breath of life. <lb/>

          <p>CH. 0 sovereign Jove! now hast thou destroyed the arma­ <lb/>
            ment of the high-vaunting and numerous Persians ; and thou <lb/>
            hast veiled in gloomy grief the city of Susa and of Ecbatana : <lb/>
            and many virgins, rending their veils with their delicate hands, <lb/>
            sharing in the sorrow, drench their bosoms with dense floods <lb/>
            of tears. Our Persian matrons too, in excess of mourning, <lb/>
            longing for the sight of the recent wedlock of their husbands, <lb/>
            and having abandoned their couches' covered with elegant <lb/>
            tapestry, the delight of their delicate youth, they sorrow with <lb/>
            most insatiate sighs. And I, for my part, heartily take [for <lb/>
            my theme] the melancholy fate of the departed.</p>
          <p>Now, in truth, the whole of the land of Asia made ceso. <note type="footnote"> 1 Person thinks that this inharmonious verse was intended to espress <lb/>

            well-a-day! Xerxes managed all things haplessly in his <lb/>
            ocean-barks. Oh ! why was not Darius at that time in com­ <lb/>
            mand, so safe a master of the bow to the citizens, beloved <lb/>
            sovereign of Susa? The ships, all winged alike and with <lb/>
            dark-stained beaks, carried forth both our land forces and our <lb/>
            marines, 0 gods ! and ships destroyed them, ah ! well-a-day ! <lb/>
            the ships with the deadly onslaughts of their beaks, and through <lb/>
            the hands of the Ionians, as we hear, the king barely made his <lb/>
            escape to the champagne and chilly tracts of Thrace. They <lb/>
            therefore, indeed, first met their doom, alas! left by necessity, <lb/>
            ah! around the shores of Cychreial, woe's me! they have been <lb/>
            drenched by the billows2. Moan, and gnash the teeth, and raise <lb/>
            aloud the cry of sorrow; laments that shall reach the heavens, <lb/>
            woe's me ! and lengthen out the dismally-sounding shout, the <lb/>
            piteous cry. And torn dreadfully by the sea, alas! they are <lb/>
            lacerated by the dumb children, alas! of the unpolluted [deep,] <lb/>
            woe's me! And the dwelling mourns its lord, bereft of him, <lb/>
            and parents that are left childless, woe's me! advanced in age, <lb/>
            wailing the calamities sent on them by the divinities, now <lb/>
            hear the whole of their sorrow. And they in sooth through­ <lb/>
            out the land of Asia, no longer own the Persian sway, nor any <lb/>
            longer pay their tribute under constraint imposed by their <lb/>
            sovereign, nor prostrating themselves on the ground will they <lb/>
            hold themselves in subjection: for the might of our monarch hath <lb/>
            utterly perished. And no longer is the tongue of mortals <lb/>
            held in check: for the people have been set at liberty to speak <lb/>
            their mind freely, since the yoke of strength hath been <lb/>
            loosened. And the sea-washed isle of Ajax, with its soil <lb/>
            stained with gore, holds the [bodies] of the Persians.</p>

            way from my house a second time, without either car or my <lb/>
            former pomp, bringing propitiatory drink-offerings for the sire <lb/>
            of my child, things which are soothing charms to the dead; <lb/>
            both, white milk, sweet for drink, from a holy cow, and the <lb/>
            distillation of the flower-craftsman, transparent honey, along <lb/>

            life in its leaves, is at hand, and wreathed flowers, children of <lb/>
            the all-teeming earth. But, my friends, chaunt ye lays in <lb/>
            accordance with these libations of the dead, and call up the <lb/>
            divine Darius, and I will convey to the gods below these <lb/>

          <p>CH. Royal dame, venerable majesty of the Persians, do thou <lb/>
            convey libations to the chambers beneath the earth, and we, in <lb/>
            our lays, will implore the conductors of the dead beneath the <lb/>
            earth to be propitious. Come, 0 ye holy divinities below the <lb/>

            dead, send from beneath the spirit into the light of day; for if <lb/>
            he knows any remedy2 of our ills, he alone could tell the ter­ <lb/>

            of blessed memory, hear me as I utter the all -varied barbaric <lb/>

            binding it with hammer-wrought fetters, accomplished a <lb/>
            great road for his great army, and he un wisely thought, <lb/>
            mortal as he was, that he should get the mastery of all the <lb/>
            gods, and of Neptune. Did not therefore a distemper of soul <lb/>

            from want of manhood, wars at home, and nought augments <lb/>

            should sway the whole of flock-breeding Asia, wielding the <lb/>

            fourth1 in order a son of Cyrus ruled the host: and Smerdis <lb/>
            reigned fifth, a disgrace to his country, and to the ancient <lb/>
            throne: but valiant Artaphrenes, along with friends, whose <lb/>
            part this was2, slew him in the palace by stratagem. And I <lb/>
            too attained to the lot which I desired, and waged many wars <lb/>
            with a large army; but I brought not such great mischief as <lb/>
            this upon the city. But Xerxes my son, bLin,,- young, has <lb/>
            youthful thoughts, and bears not in mind ray injunctions; for <lb/>
            of this be ye well and distinctly assured, ye my compeers in <lb/>
            age, all of us who held this sovereignty, could not be shown <lb/>
            to have wrought so many evils.</p>
          <p>CH. What then, my liege Darius ? to what point turnest <lb/>
            thou the issue of thy words ? In consequence of these events, <lb/>
            how shall we thy Persian host hereafter fare as best may be ?</p>
          <p>DAR. If we make not war upon the country of the Greeks; <lb/>
            no, not even if the Median force be the larger: for to them <lb/>
            the earth herself is an ally.</p>
          <p>On:. How sayest thou this ?and in what way acts it as an <lb/>
            ally ?</p>
          <p>bAR. Inasmuch as it slays by famine those that are over <lb/>
            numerous.</p>
          <p>On. Well, but we will furnish forth an expedition well <lb/>
            equipped and select.</p>
          <p>DAR. Aye, but not even shall the army that now remains in <lb/>
            the regions of Hellas attain to a safe return.</p>

            ment of the barbarians cross the frith of Helle from Europe ?</p>
          <p>DAR. Few, be sure, of many, if it be proper for one that <lb/>
            looks upon what hath now taken place at all to put faith in <lb/>
            the declarations of the gods: for it is not that one part is ac­ <lb/>
            complished, and another not. And if this be the fact, the <lb/>

            await them to suffer, in retribution for their presumption and <lb/>
            godless devices; who, when they arrived in the land of <lb/>
            Hellas, shrunk not from despoiling the statues of the gods, <lb/>
            nor from firing their shrines : but the altars are demolished, <lb/>
            and the temples of the divinities utterly overthrown from <lb/>
            their basements in confused ruin ; wherefore, having done <lb/>
            evil, they experience not less, and will still further; and <lb/>
            not yet is it come to the dregs' of their calamities, but still <lb/>
            they keep on gushing forth: for so great a clotted gore-drip­ <lb/>
            ping mass shall there be amid the land of the Platæans, <lb/>
            beneath the Dorian spear; and heaps of corpses, even to the <lb/>
            third generation, shall voicelessly announce to the eyes of <lb/>
            mortale, how that it becomes not one that is mortal to enter­ <lb/>
            tain thoughts too high for him. For presumption, when it <lb/>
            has bloomed, is wont to produce for fruit a crop of Atè, <lb/>
            whence it reaps an all-mournful harvest. Seeing such are the <lb/>
            recompenses of these things, be ye mindful of Athens and of <lb/>
            Hellas, and let not any one contemning his present fortune, <lb/>
            enamoured of other things, cast away great felicity. Jove is <lb/>
            in sooth over us a chastiser of extremely overbearing thoughts, <lb/>
            a stern censor. Wherefore do ye instruct him, destitute as <lb/>
            he is of prudence3, with reasonable admonitions, that he <lb/>
            should cease to insult the gods with his overweening confi­ <lb/>
            dence. And do thou, dear aged mother of Xerxes, go into the <lb/>
            palace, and feteh vesture such as is seemly, and meet thy <lb/>
            child; for in his sorrow for these misfortunes, tatters of his <lb/>
            embroidered robes are rent all about his person. But do thou <lb/>
            mildly soothe him with words; for to thee alone, I am assured, <lb/>
            will he endure to listen. But I will depart from earth into <lb/>
            the gloom that is beneath. And you, my aged friends, give <lb/>
            yourselves to joy, though ye be in afflictions, giving your <lb/>
            spirits to pleasure day by day ; since to the dead wealth is of <lb/>
            no avail. [The shade of DARIUS descends4. <note type="footnote"> 1 There is something inconsistent in the fact that Darius, who required <lb/>
            to be told how the Persians had fared, should be able to tell how they <lb/>

            goodly life, under civic rule, when the aged monarch, aider of <lb/>
            all, author of no ill, not given to war, godlike Darius ruled <lb/>
            the realm. In the first place we were celebrated on account <lb/>
            of our well-approved army, and the laws of the state directed <lb/>
            all things 2. And our returns too from our wars brought us <lb/>
            without trouble, without suffering, in flourishing condition to <lb/>
            our homes. And what a number of cities did he take without <lb/>
            having crossed the river Halys, nor having sped forth from <lb/>
            his home; such are the Acheloian cities on the Strymonian <lb/>
            sea, adjoining the dwellings of the Thraeians, and beyond the <lb/>
            sea, those along the main land environed with fortresses <lb/>
            obeyed this king, and those who boast3 to dwell on both sides <lb/>
            of the broad frith of Helle, and the gulfy Propontis, and the <lb/>
            outlet of the Poutus : the sea-girt islands too, near the marine <lb/>
            promontory, lying hard by this land, Lesbos, for instance, and <lb/>

            I have a night bewildered and dew-drenched couch1, not <lb/>
            visited by dreams, for fear, in place of sleep, stands at my <lb/>
            side, so that I cannot firmly close my eyelids in slumber. And <lb/>
            when I think to sing or whistle, preparing2 this the counter- <lb/>
            charm of song against sleep, then do I mourn, sighing over <lb/>
            the sad condition of this house, that is not, as of yore, most <lb/>
            excellently administered. But now, may there be a happy <lb/>
            release from my toils, as the fire of joyous tidings appears <lb/>
            through the gloom! Oh hail! thou lamp of night, thou that <lb/>
            displayest a light like as the day, and the marshalling of <lb/>
            many dances in Argos, on account of this event3. Ho ! ho ! <lb/>
            I will give a signal distinetly to the wife of Agamemnon, that <lb/>
            she, having arisen with all speed from her couch, may raise <lb/>
            aloud a joyous shout in welcome to this beacon, if indeed the <lb/>
            city of Ilion is taken, as the beacon-light stands forth4 announc­ <lb/>

            throws of my lord that have fallen well, mine own5, since this <lb/>
            kindling of the beacon-light has cast me thrice six. May it <lb/>
            then befal me to grasp with this hand of mine the friendly <lb/>

            hearing aloft the shrill-voiced wail uttered by the birds on <lb/>
            account of these outeasts5, sends Erinnys, the late avenger, <lb/>

            Bamberger and Dindorf, who understand the sacrifice of Iphigenia to be <lb/>
            meant. And if we consider the connexion of the sense, this is clearly <lb/>
            required by the context from v. 40, as follows : The Atridæ hover over <lb/>
            the heads of those who stole away Helen, like vultures mourning ovei <lb/>

            means will Agamemnon avert the unflinching wrath resulting from Iphi­ <lb/>

            If you pour into the same vessel both vinegar and oil, you will <lb/>

            hear the voices of the captured and the conquerors distinct <lb/>
            [because of] a double result; for the one party having fallen <lb/>
            about the corpses of men, both those of brothers, and children <lb/>
            those of their aged parents, are bewailing, from a throat that <lb/>

            himself with these doings. Such too was Paris, when he came <lb/>
            to the mansion of the Atreidæ, and profaned the hospitable <lb/>
            board by the abduction of a wife. And she, leaving citizens <lb/>

            voice, but I do not see how that fact involves any difficulty. May it not <lb/>
            purposely be used to signify the willing elopement of Helen ? I has </note> <pb n="108"/>
            <note type="chapter"> 413—444 </note> <lb/>

            the house, and the beauty of fair-formed statues is loathed by <lb/>
            her husband, and in the unfed glance1 of his eyes all their <lb/>
            loveliness passes away. And melancholy visions, appearing in <lb/>
            dreams, present themselves, bringing a vain delight; for vain <lb/>
            it is when any one seeming to see blessings, the vision having <lb/>

            sorrows at the hearth', within the mansion, but there are <lb/>
            sorrows surpassing these. And universally because of the <lb/>
            heroes who went together from the land of Hellas, the sorrow <lb/>
            of a patient spirit from the families of each is plainly <lb/>
            observable. Many things of a truth touch them to the core; <lb/>
            for those whom any one sent forth, he knows, but, instead of <lb/>
            men, urns and ashes come back to the dwellings of each. And <lb/>
            Mars, that barters for gold their bodies, and that holds the <lb/>
            balance in the tug of the spears, sends to their friends some <lb/>
            fragment of scorched dust from Ilion, a thing of bitter tears, <lb/>
            filling the vases with light3 ashes instead of the man. And they <note type="footnote"> used a word of the same force in the translation. Thus Euripides, Iph. <lb/>

            following his own taste, instead of the tasteless defence of the common <lb/>
            reading, proposed by others. The sight of a beautiful image would recall <lb/>
            the memory of Helen to her husband, but his sight was not fed with the <lb/>
            real presence of a loved object: <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀχηνίαις</foreign> must refer to the eyes of Mene­ <lb/>

            others, fair of form, there around the walls, occupy tombs in <lb/>

            Bitter is the rumour of the citizens accompanied by wrath, <lb/>
            and it pays the debt as of a curse2 ratified by the people. And <lb/>
            my anxious care is waiting to hear something wrapt in nightly <lb/>
            gloom. For the gods are not regardless of those that occasion <lb/>
            great slaughter: and the black Erinnyes in time, reduce to <lb/>
            obscurity the man that is fortunate without righteousness, by <lb/>
            a reverse of fortune; and the power of him that lives among <lb/>
            the obscure is naught. Now for a man to have an exceedingly3 <lb/>
            high reputation is a sad thing; for the thunderbolt from Jove <lb/>
            is lanched against his eyes4; but I prefer happiness free from <lb/>
            envy. May I never be a saeker of cities, nor yet myself a <lb/>

            the fire that brings glad tidings a swift rumour is pervading <lb/>
            the city-but who knows whether it be true5? or some delusion <lb/>
            of the gods. Who is so childish, or bereft of judgment, as, <lb/>
            after having been warmed in heart by the recent tidings of the <lb/>
            beacon-light, to despond at a change of news? It fits a <lb/>
            woman's it7 to acknowledge a boon before it has appeared. <lb/>
            The female sex, over credulous, ranges with rapid step; but <lb/>

            bedded,—and in what part of the day were we not sighing, <lb/>
            as not having met with our portion2 ?—And then again the ills <lb/>
            on shore were added, more loathly still: for our beds were <lb/>
            hard by the walls of our foes : and from the sky and from the <lb/>
            soil the meadow-dews drizzled on us, a deep rankling destruc­ <lb/>

            the thought about ever hereafter rising. Why need one <lb/>

            to bid a long farewell to misfortunes. With us, the remnant <lb/>

          <p>Long since, in truth, I raised the jocund shout through <lb/>
            delight, when the first mighty messenger of fire arrived, <lb/>
            telling of the capture and overthrow of Ilion.—And some <lb/>
            one chiding me said, “ Dost thou, persuaded by beacon- <lb/>

            like a woman to be much elated in heart." By words like <lb/>
            these I was made to seem in error1. Nevertheless I went on <lb/>
            sacrificing; and, by a woman's edict, one and another, in <lb/>
            different places throughout the city, raised aloud a shout of <lb/>
            joy, pouring forth a hallowed song in the dwelling of the gods, <lb/>
            while they lulled the fragrant incense-fed flame. And now <lb/>
            what need is there for thee to say more to me ? From the <lb/>

            not hearing our plea from the tongue, flung without hesitation <lb/>
            into the gory vase their ballots, the destruction of Ilion fatal <lb/>
            to men, and o'er the opposite urn that was not filled by the <lb/>

            shews evidently that it has been captured. The storms of Atè <lb/>
            are alive; and the embers, dying along with the city, send <lb/>
            forth rich exhalations of wealth. For these things it behoves <lb/>
            us to repay ever mindful gratitude to the gods; since we both <lb/>
            formed for ourselves1 a proud gin of conquest, and in a <lb/>
            woman's cause the Argive monster bath levelled the city with <lb/>
            the dust,-the young of the horse, the host equipped with <lb/>

            Pleiades, and the ravening lion springing over the towers bath <lb/>
            lapped his fill of princely blood. To the gods have I lengthened <lb/>

            the whole long time that this [my lord] was beneath the walls <lb/>
            of Ilion. First of all, it is dreadful evil for a woman to sit de­ <lb/>
            solate in her dwelling without her mate, hearing many adverse <lb/>
            tidings, how that one messenger has come, and another is <lb/>
            bringing news in addition of another evil worse than the <lb/>
            [former] evil, proclaiming them to the house. And had this <lb/>
            my husband met with as many wounds as report conveyed <lb/>
            to his home, he would have been pierced more full [of <lb/>
            holes] than a net, so to say. And had he died as tales were <lb/>
            rife, i'faith he might have boasted that he a second Geryon <lb/>
            had received a mighty threefold vest of earth, above ground, <lb/>

            at my side as he should have done ; nor marvel thou at this; <lb/>

            him, who forewarned me of twofold mischiefs-both thine <lb/>

            some public burst of anarchy might overthrow the senate, <lb/>
            since it is inborn in mortals to spurn the rather him who <lb/>
            falls: such excuse, believe me, brings no wile. In me, <lb/>
            indeed, the gushing fountains of my weeping have been <lb/>
            exhausted, not even a drop is left. I bear too marrings <lb/>
            of mine eyes, late closed in slumber, bewailing the lamp <lb/>
            kept burning for thy sake ever unheeded2 : and in my <lb/>
            dreams I was awakened by the light flitting of the buzzing <lb/>
            gnat, seeing more sufferings befall thee3 than could possibly <lb/>
            have happened during my time of sleep4.—Now having en­ <lb/>
            dured all these horrors, I will, with a soul not sorrowful, call <lb/>

            stay of the ship, a foundation pillar of the lofty roof, an only <lb/>
            child to parent, a land that hath appeared to mariners beyond <lb/>

            gushing rill to a thirsty wayfarer5. And delightful 'tis to <note type="footnote"> passage, although I confess that Symmons' remarks shew considerable <lb/>

            barbaric monarch, gape-out to me an outcry of earth-prostrate <lb/>
            [homage] : nor make my path obnoxious to the evil eye by <lb/>
            strewing it with vestments. With these indeed it is fitting to <lb/>
            honour the gods : but for one that is a mortal to walk on <lb/>
            embroidered purple, is for me by no means free from dread ; <lb/>

            to my portent-boding heart, and in an unbought unbidden strain <lb/>
            plays prophet, nor doth well-assured confidence take seat <lb/>
            upon my heart's dear throne, after rejecting this like dreams <lb/>
            hard of Interpretation ? Long is the time since the naval <lb/>
            armament with their cables cast firmly into the sandy shore, <lb/>
            languished away2, when it was speeding to Ilion.—And I <lb/>
            learn their return from my eyes, being myself my own witness. <lb/>
            And yet, notwithstanding this, my soul within me, self-taught, <lb/>
            is chanting the lament of an Erinnys unaccompanied by the <lb/>
            lyre, in nought possessing the dear confidence of hope. And <lb/>
            my bosom tells no idle tale, my heart being whirled in eddies <lb/>
            by just thoughts that have fulfilment. But I pray that those, <lb/>
            beyond my hope, may turn out to be false, so as to come to no <lb/>

          <p>Though many things have been before spoken as suited the <lb/>
            occasion, I shall not blush to speak the contrary. For how <lb/>
            else could one, while providing enmity for enemies, construct <lb/>
            for those that seem friends dense snares of mischief, a height <lb/>
            too great to overleap? and this struggle of an ancient feud <lb/>
            came not on me without having been long since meditated, <lb/>
            though certainly late. And I stand where I struck him,—now <lb/>
            the deed is done and over1: I did it too in such a way-and <lb/>
            this I will not deny-that he could neither escape nor ward on <lb/>
            his doom. I stake around an endless net, as if for fishes, the <lb/>
            deathly treasure of a vesture. And I smite him twice, and <lb/>
            with two groans he dropped his limbs, and on him fallen I <lb/>
            add a third blow, a votive offering to him beneath the earth, <lb/>
            Hades, the guardian of the dead. Thus he gulps away2 his <lb/>
            own soul as he falls; and gurgling forth the sharp gush of the <lb/>
            shedded blood, he smites with black drops of gory dew me <lb/>
            that rejoiced no less than the sown [land] does in Jove's rich <lb/>
            gift3 during the travails of the ear. Since then 'tis thus, oh <lb/>

            Orestes, of all mortals to me most dear? But I am fawned upon <lb/>
            by hope. Alas! would to heaven that it had an intelligent voice, <lb/>
            like a messenger, that I might not be agitated by distracted <lb/>

            from the head of a foe, or that, if it claim kin to me, it might <lb/>

            honour to my father2. But we invoke the gods, who know in <lb/>

            it is our destiny to attain safety, a great stock might be pro­ <lb/>

            what it is that she pays too late attention to an irreparable <lb/>

            was sent. I cannot guess the import of these gifts, but they <lb/>
            are too small for the trespass. For though one were to make <lb/>

            and I, changed into a serpent, will slay her, as this dream of <lb/>

              by Cretan necklaces of wrought gold, the gifts of Minos, what <lb/>
              time she, shameless, robbed Nisus of his undying ringlet as <lb/>
              he was breathing unsuspectingly in sleep; but Mercury1 <lb/>
              overtakes her. And since I have made mention of savage <lb/>
              horrors, though unseasonably2, [one may also mention] the <lb/>
              odious match, execrated by the house, and plots laid by a <lb/>
              woman's mind against an armed warrior, against a warrior for <lb/>
              his majesty bitter to his enemies; and I honour the hearth of <lb/>
              a household that knows not audacity, and in women an <lb/>
              undaring spirit. Of horrors, indeed, that of Lemnos holds the <lb/>
              first place in story; and it is deplored in every clime as an <lb/>
              abomination, and a man is wont to compare what is dreadful <lb/>
              to Lemnian sufferings3. And by reason of heaven-detested <lb/>
              guilt the race of mortals perishes in infamy; for no one reveres <lb/>
              that which is offensive to the gods. Which of these hideous <lb/>
              facts do I unreasonably reckon up? But the sword, sharp and <lb/>
              bitter, inflicts a wound right through the lungs, driven by the <lb/>
              hand of Justice. For the lawless conduct of him4 that bath <lb/>
              lawlessly trespassed against every awful attribute of Jupiter, <lb/>
              is not trampled under foot on the ground. But the base of <lb/>
              Justice is planted firm; and Fate, that forges the sword, pre­ <lb/>
              pares it for the deed, and brings into the house a new offering <lb/>
              of ancient murders, and time-honoured5 Erinnys avenges the <lb/>

            indeed shall we put forth the strength of our mouths on <lb/>

            for now is it high time for wily plausibility and the nether <lb/>

          <p>The stranger seems to be working mischief. But I see the <lb/>

            Cilissa, art thou treading the outlet1 of the palace? and no <lb/>

            man the tidings just reported. Before the domestics, indeed, <lb/>
            she suppressed her laughter within her scowling eyes, conceal­ <lb/>

            house all unhappily, in consequence of the tale which the <lb/>

            rejoice in his mind, when he shall have learned the news. <lb/>
            Alas, wretch that I am! how did the ancient blended sorrows, <lb/>
            hard to be endured, that happened to this mansion of Atreus, <lb/>
            afflict with anguish my heart within my bosom! But never <lb/>
            yet did I undergo any suffering such as this. For the rest of <lb/>
            my calamities I bore through with patience; but my dear <lb/>
            Orestes, the care of my soul, whom I reared up, having <lb/>
            received him from the moment of his birth3 and from his <lb/>
            arousing cries, disturbing me by night many fruitless toils <lb/>

            the feet of the dead ? nay rather, thou mightest call it a net <lb/>

            robber might have in his possession; one that deceives stran­ <lb/>

            gods. And as for my provocatives to this daring, I prize most <lb/>

            returns.) Certainly things dreadful to tell, and dreadful to <lb/>

            so that I neither have strength, nor can uplift my steps : but <lb/>

            And alive you shall feed me, not slain at the altar, and you <lb/>
            shall hear this hymn that charms you. Come then, let us also <lb/>
            join the dance, since it has seemed good to us to pour forth <lb/>
            the hated song, and to declare how our band distributes its­ <lb/>
            lots among men; and we delight in being upright [ministers] <lb/>
            of justice. On him indeed who possesses pure hands no wrath <lb/>

            whoever, committing crime, like this man, conceals his bloody <lb/>
            hands, close at hand as true witnesses to the dead, we appear <lb/>

            pursuing, oh! strong though he be, we destroy, because of <lb/>
            newly-shed blood. And earnestly striving to take away from <lb/>
            another this care, and to effect an exemption for the gods in <lb/>
            regard to prayers offered to me, and not to come into question <lb/>
            of arbitration1: for Jove deems unworthy of his converse this <lb/>
            blood-dripping justly-hated band. For suddenly leaping from <lb/>
            above, I bring down the strength of my foot with heavy fall, limbs <lb/>
            that cause the swift2 to trip, an intolerable calamity. And the <lb/>
            thoughts of men even when very lofty beneath the sky, waste <lb/>
            away, and decrease down to earth unhonoured, at our approach <lb/>
            clad in our black garments, and at the hated dances of our <lb/>
            feet. But falling he knows not this, through his foolish <lb/>
            -distraction: such darkness hovers upon the man on account <lb/>
            of his crime, and rumour with many groans proclaims3 the <lb/>

            mind the original signification of <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὅρκος</foreign>; namely, the object whereby one <lb/>
            takes oath and binding on the conscience of the party taking oath. This <lb/>
            object is named to the challenged by the challenging party ; for instance, <lb/>
            the head of his child, or such and such gods. This is called giving an <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὅρκος</foreign>. In the next place it must be kept in view, that an oath of this <lb/>
            kind, demanded of, or tendered to one party by the other, forms part of <lb/>
            the evidence. For that evidence required a challenge (<foreign xml:lang="grc">πρόκλησις</foreign>) and <lb/>
            the acceptation of it: both parties must be agreed to rest the decision of <lb/>
            the suit on the oath of one of the two parties, before the oath could be <lb/>
            admitted and stand as substantive evidenceThe meaning then <lb/>
            of what the Erinnys say is this: ‘Orestes will scarcely allow us to name <lb/>
            the oath which he shall take to attest his innocence, nor will he readily <lb/>
            consent to let the verdict depend upon our swearing to his guilt by what­ <lb/>
            ever oath he shall please to propose to us ;’ and they are perfectly right <lb/>
            in their opinion. But Minerva very properly refuses to admit such a <lb/>
            mode of decision in this case, as being a mere show of the right, by which <lb/>
            she will not allow the wrong to gain the day." Muller, p. 177, sq <lb/>
            The same elegant critic observes that Æschylus does not allude to the <lb/>
            customary oath used in the Court of Areopagus,—(on which the student <lb/>
            may compare the following passages of the Greek Orators : Demosth. in <lb/>
            Aristocr. p. 642; Antiphon de cæde Herod. p. 716 ; Lysias in Thcomn. <lb/>
            p. 352, 3 ; Dinarchus in Demosth. p. 35, ed. Reiske)—“because it has <lb/>
            no specific significance in this particular case; just as the oath of the <lb/>
            Areopagites to do strict justice is frequently referred to in the course of <lb/>

            until by a man who cleanses from the impurity of blood, the <lb/>

            this your care. But what my race is, you shall quickly hear. <lb/>
            I am an Argive, and well do you know my father, Agamem­ <lb/>
            non4, leader of naval heroes; with whom you made the Trojan <lb/>
            city of Ilion no city. He perished not gloriously, having <lb/>
            come to his home: for my dark-souled mother slew him, <lb/>
            having wrapt him in artful toils, [and she herself] bore wit­ <lb/>
            ness to the murder of the bath. And I returning home, <lb/>
            having been an exile the time before this, slew her who gave <lb/>
            me birth, I will not deny it, with the vengeance of retributory <lb/>
            slaughter, on account of my dearest father. And of these <lb/>

            blood-stained? do you disown the most dear blood of your <lb/>
            mother?</p>
          <p>OR. Now do you give testimony. But declare for me. <lb/>
            Apollo, if I slew her with justice: for we do not deny that <lb/>
            we have done it, as it is done: but if this blood seem to your <lb/>
            mind justly or unjustly shed, judge, that I may speak to <lb/>
            these.</p>
          <p>Ap. I will speak justly to you, this great council of Mi­ <lb/>
            nerva, and being a prophet I will not lie. Never at any time <lb/>
            have I spoken in my prophetic shrine either concerning man, <lb/>
            woman, or city, what Jove father of the Olympians has not <lb/>
            commanded. Learn, with respect to this justice, of how <lb/>
            great power it is; but I bid you obey the counsel of my <lb/>
            father, for an oath by no means is more powerful than Jove.</p>
          <p>On. Jove, as you say, gave this oracle2, that you should <lb/>
            tell this Orestes, having avenged the murder of his father <lb/>
            by no means to regard the reverence due to his mother.</p>
          <p>Ap. [Yes.] For it is not the same thing that a noble hero <lb/>
            should die, honoured with Jove-given sceptres, and that, too, by <lb/>
            a woman, not by impetuous far-darting bows, like an Amazon, <lb/>
            but as Pallas shall hear, and they who sit to decide by vote <lb/>
            concerning this matter. For having received him on his re­ <lb/>
            turn from the expedition, where he had gained the greatest <lb/>
            honours in the best manner according to the opinion of those <lb/>
            well-inclined to him3, in the washing-place as he was passing <note type="footnote"> 1 See Muller, § 48, p. 135. who fully illustrates the difficulty undo: <lb/>

            whole passage thus: “receiving him with a bath, more courteously than <lb/>
            can be expressed, upon his return from the expedition, where he had <lb/>
            gained the ulmost honours—as he was passing through the water and </note> <pb n="199"/>
            <note type="chapter"> 634—664 </note> <lb/>
            through the bath, and at the end covered him with a robe, <lb/>
            and having entangled her husband in an artfully-woven eir­ <lb/>
            cular garment she struck him. This fate, indeed, of the <lb/>
            hero all-venerable, the commander of ships, has been told to <lb/>
            you: this woman have I described as such, that the assembly <lb/>
            may be stung with indignation, which has been appointed <lb/>
            to determine this cause.</p>
          <p>CH. Jove by your account respects the death of a father; <lb/>
            but he himself bound his aged father Saturn1. How do you <lb/>
            say that these things are not contrary to those ? But I call <lb/>
            you as witnesses to hear these things.</p>
          <p>Ap. 0 all-hated monsters, abhorred by the gods, from <lb/>
            fetters, indeed, (there is a cure for this) even many a <lb/>
            liberating device might have released him2. But when the <lb/>
            dust has drunk up the blood of a man once dead, there is no <lb/>
            raising it up. For these things my father has not made a <lb/>
            charm; but he appoints all other things turning them up and <lb/>
            down, in no wise panting in his strength.</p>
          <p>CH. But see how you [defend] this man contrary to justice, <lb/>
            that he may escape. Having poured out on the plain the <lb/>
            kindred blood of his mother, shall he then inhabit the house <lb/>
            of his father in Argos? using which of the public altars? and <lb/>
            what layer of his tribe shall receive him?</p>
          <p>AP. This, too, will I declare, and learn how rightly I speak. <lb/>
            She is not the mother who is called the parent of the child, <lb/>
            but nurse of the newly-sown offspring3. But the male is the <lb/>
            generative source, and she like a stranger preserves the plant <lb/>
            for a stranger, for those whom the god may not have injured. <lb/>
            But I will shew you a proof of these words: a father might be <lb/>
            without a mother; the daughter of Olympian Jove is close at <note type="footnote"> had reached the end (of the vessel, or, when he had ended his ablutions), <lb/>

              the city. For who of mortals, that fears nothing, is just? <lb/>
              Awed justly therefore by such an object of reverence, you <lb/>
              would have both a defence of your country and safeguard of <lb/>
              your city, such as no men possess. Neither among the <lb/>
              Scythians nor in the realms of Pelops have I appointed this <lb/>

              the cause reverencing the oath. My say is said.</p>

            this dire band of [the infernal] region.</p>
          <p>Ap. And I, for my part, bid you fear both my oracles and <lb/>
            those of Jove, nor to render them fruitless.</p>
          <p>CH. But you regard matters of bloodshed, not having beei. <lb/>
            allotted such office; and no longer remaining here will you. <lb/>
            utter pure oracles.</p>
          <p>AP. Was my father, too, in any way mistaken In his <lb/>
            counsels in the supplication of Ixion, for the first slaughter?</p>

            is no mother who produced me. But I praise the male in all <lb/>
            things, save in obtaining marriage, with all my soul; and I <lb/>

            of the house. But Orestes prevails, even if he be judged with <lb/>
            equal votes. Cast out the lots from the vessel as quickly as <lb/>

            for you; that you may never say, that you an ancient goddess, <lb/>

            depart dishonoured, inhospitably driven from this land. But <lb/>
            if indeed the reverence of Persuasion is holy in your eyes, the <lb/>

            having settled in this place these mighty deities, and hard to <lb/>
            be appeased: for they have obtained by lot to administer all <lb/>
            things regarding men. But he who has not found them <lb/>
            gentle, knows not whence come the ills of life: for the sins of <lb/>
            his forefathers lead him away to these, and silent destruction <lb/>
            with hostile wrath lays him low even while talking big.</p>

            and with respect to men they manifestly and powerfully bring <lb/>

            city. And do you sons of Cranaus inhabiting the city, con­ <lb/>

            deities. Would that 'the will] of Jove would bring to pass <lb/>
            all things truly. The counsel of Jove is not easily traced out, <lb/>
            yet in all things it shines forth, even in darkness, with black <lb/>
            calamity to articulate-voiced men. But it falls firmly not <lb/>
            upon its back2, if a thing be perfected by the head of Jove: <lb/>
            for the ways of the [divine] breast stretch thick and shady, <lb/>
            difficult to discover. But he smites abandoned mortals, look­ <lb/>
            ing down3 from his high-towered heights, and no one arms <lb/>
            violence unpunished by the deity: the [divine] mind sitting <lb/>
            aloft4 upon holy seats, nevertheless from that place takes ven­ <lb/>
            geance on it. But let him look to the insolence of mortal <lb/>
            men, how a youthful stock shoots anew, blooming6 on account <lb/>
            of my nuptials, with ill-advised purpose, and having furious <lb/>
            thoughts, an inevitable sting, and having resolved on an in­ <lb/>

            not Grecian in its garb, delicately attired in barbarian robes, <lb/>
            and in many folds ? for this attire of women is not Argolic, <lb/>

            fearlessly to come to this country, neither [announced] by <lb/>
            heralds, and without a public host, without conductors, this is <lb/>

            land. And from me their king the race of Pelasgians aptly <lb/>

            mountains of Dodona : but the boundary of the watery deep <lb/>
            cuts it off: and beyond these parts I rule. But this plain of <lb/>
            the Apian land long since was named on account of a man <lb/>
            skilled in healing arts : for Apis having come from the country <lb/>

            earth defiled by pollutions of ancient blood produced, fierce <lb/>
            animals, a dragon band, a dire fellowship. Of these Apis <lb/>
            having blamelessly made complete and liberating remedies for <lb/>
            the Argive land, found hereafter his memory in prayers as his <lb/>
            reward. Having now signs from me you can declare your <lb/>

            not.</p>

            her son: and I will prove all these things I say to be true.</p>
          <p>PEL. You relate incredible things, 0 strangers, for me to <lb/>
            hear, that this your race is Argive. For you are more like <lb/>
            to Lybian women, and by no means to the natives of my <lb/>
            country. The Nile might nurture such an offspring, and a <lb/>
            like Cyprian image is stamped in female forms by male artists; <lb/>
            and I hear that the wandering Indians ride on pannier-packed <lb/>
            camels fleet as steeds, in their land bordering on the Ethio­ <lb/>
            pians : and by all means I had conjectured that you were <lb/>
            the unwedded flesh-eating Amazons, if you had carried bows. <lb/>
            Instructed I would know this farther, how your race and <lb/>
            seed is Argive.</p>

          <p>PEL. You speak grievous things, to raise a new war.</p>
          <p>CH. But Justice defends her allies.</p>
          <p>PEL. If perchance she was a sharer of their affairs from <lb/>
            the beginning.</p>
          <p>CH. Revere the stern of the state thus crowned.</p>
          <p>PEL. I shudder beholding these shaded seats.</p>
          <p>On;. Grievous, indeed, is the wrath of Jove who guards the <lb/>
            suppliant. Son of Palæcthon, hear me with willing heart, <lb/>
            king of the Pelasgians. Behold me a suppliant, an exile, a <lb/>
            wanderer, like a white-spotted2 heifer on the lofty rocks, where <lb/>
            trusting for aid she lows telling to the herdsman her troubles.</p>
          <p>PEL. I behold a youthful band3 shaded with new-cropt <lb/>
            boughs [at the altars] of these gods who preside over the <lb/>
            games. But may this business of the guests of our city be <lb/>
            unattended with hurt: nor let strife arise to the city from <lb/>
            unexpected and sudden things, for these the city wants not.</p>
          <p>CH. May Then,-is, the goddess of suppliants, daughter of <lb/>
            lot-directing Jove, regard in truth our harmless flight: but <lb/>
            do you though being an old man4 in mind, learn from one <lb/>
            younger; reverencing a suppliant, you shall not be reduced to <lb/>
            want5. gifts offered to the gods from a pure man.</p>
          <p>PEL. By no means do you sit at the hearth of my house : <lb/>

            promise, before at least having- communicated with all these <lb/>
            of! citizens concerning these things.</p>
          <p>CH. You are the city, and you are the people, being a ruler <lb/>
            accountable to none, you have sway over the altar, the hearth <lb/>
            of the land : by your sole-deciding nod, and on a sole-sceptred <lb/>
            throne you determine everything; beware of pollution.</p>
          <p>PEL. May pollution, indeed, be upon my enemies: but I <lb/>
            cannot aid you without harm, nor again is it prudent to reject <lb/>
            these prayers. But I am perplexed, and fear holds my mind, <lb/>
            whether to act, or not to act, and to take my chance.</p>
          <p>CH. Look to the beholder on high, the protector of troubled <lb/>
            mortals, who. sitting [as suppliants] before their kindred, <lb/>
            obtain not lawful justice. Therefore the wrath of Jove guar­ <lb/>
            dian of suppliants waits upon the wailing of the sufferer, that <lb/>
            cannot be appeased.</p>
          <p>PEL. If the sons of .Egyptus have power over you by the <lb/>
            law of your state, saying that they are nearest of kin, who <lb/>
            would wish to oppose them ? Ye needs must therefore prove <lb/>
            according to the laws of your home that they have no autho­ <lb/>
            rity over you.</p>
          <p>CH. May I never at any time then become subject to the <lb/>
            power of males: but I mark out a star-guided remedy of the <lb/>
            wretched marriage by flight: and having taken Justice an <lb/>
            ally, do thou determine according to the reverence due to the <lb/>
            gods.</p>
          <p>PEL. The judgment is not easy to judge: choose not me as <lb/>
            iudge. But I said even before, not without the people would <lb/>
            I do these things, not even though ruler, lest at any time the <lb/>
            people shall say, if perchance an. thing fall out not such [as <lb/>
            we wish,]1 honouring strangers you have destroyed the city.</p>
          <p>CH. Jove allied to both, inclining to one side, regards these <lb/>
            things, distributing as is right unjust things to the bad, but <lb/>
            the rewards of piety to the just 3. Wherefore, these being <lb/>
            equally inelined, are you pained to do what is just?</p>
          <p>PEL. There is need of deep thought4, so that the clear- <lb/>
            sighted eye may, without dizziness, reach the bottom of deep <lb/>

            and that neither strife lay hold of the pledges1, nor that we, <lb/>
            having given up you placed here in the seats of the gods. <lb/>
            bring on ourselves a dire fellow-dweller the all-destroying <lb/>
            avenging god, who, not even in the abode of Hades frees the <lb/>
            dead. Does there not seem to be need of saving thought?</p>
          <p>CH. Consider, and be most justly a pious receiver of stran­ <lb/>
            gers, betray not the exile driven from afar by godless expul­ <lb/>
            sion: nor behold me dragged as a pledge from the seats <lb/>
            sacred to many gods, 0 you who possess the whole sway of <lb/>
            the land. But consider the insolence of men, and guard <lb/>
            against their wrath. In no wise endure to behold the suppli- <lb/>
            -tilt led from the images in spite of Justice, like a steed, and <lb/>
            the seizing of my fillets and robes woven with many threads. <lb/>
            For know, whatever you determine, there awaits your children <lb/>
            and your house to suffer a like justice. Consider these just <lb/>
            commands of Jove.</p>
          <p>PEL. And truly I have considered; and the matter is <lb/>
            driven to this: it is absolutely necessary to undertake a great <lb/>
            war either with these (viz. the gods) or with those (viz. the <lb/>
            sons of Ægyptus): and it is compacted with nails, like a ship <lb/>
            put together by naval wedges. But without sorrow by no <lb/>
            means will there be a turning aside. And, indeed, when pos­ <lb/>
            sessions are borne as plunder from the house, a heap greater <lb/>
            than the loss, and which completely fills it up may arise from <lb/>
            another quarter by the kindness of bounteous Jove 2. And <lb/>
            the tongue having darted forth unseasonable things grievous, <lb/>
            and provoking wrath, there may be other words to soothe the <lb/>
            former. But it is necessary by all means to sacrifice, and for <lb/>
            many victims to be slain for many gods, remedies of calamity, <lb/>
            that kindred blood be not shed. Certainly I altogether pass <lb/>
            by this strife; but I wish to be rather ignorant of, than <lb/>
            acquainted with ills: but may matters fall out well, contrary <lb/>

            watehings of our mother, the herd-feeding mead, from whence <lb/>
            Io driven2 by the brize, flies distracted, passing through many <lb/>
            tribes of mortals: and twice by fate having cut through the <lb/>

            rivers, and the wealthy region, and the corn-abounding land <lb/>
            of Venus. She arrives, driven along by the sting of the <lb/>
            winged herdsman, at the divine all-fostering grove, the snow­ <lb/>
            fed mead, and on which comes [with]3 the might of Typho, <lb/>
            the water of Nile untouched by diseases, maddened by her <lb/>
            ignominious toils, and by the stinging pains of raging Juno. <lb/>
            But the mortals who then were dwellers in the land, were <lb/>
            seized in their minds by pale fear, beholding an unwonted <lb/>
            sight, an intractable heifer mingled with a mortal, in part a <lb/>
            heifer, and in part again a woman, and they were astonished <lb/>
            at the prodigy. And then who was it in truth who soothed <lb/>

            but the violence [of Juno ] ceases by unwasted strength, and <lb/>
            by divine influence, but she drops the mournful modesty of <lb/>
            tears. But having received the divine load, in true story, <lb/>
            she produced her blameless son, all-happy for length of time; <lb/>
            whence all the earth exclaims, this is truly the offspring of <lb/>
            life-giving Jove: for who could have made to cease the pest <lb/>

          <p>DAN. The decree has been passed by the Argives, not with <lb/>
            divided opinions, but so as for me to be young again in my <lb/>
            aged mind. For in full assembly the air hurtled with the <lb/>
            right hands [as the people] determined this matter; that we <lb/>
            should inhabit this land, free, and not as pledges, and with <lb/>
            sanctity of place among mortals; and that no one either of <lb/>
            inhabitants or strangers should lead us away: but if violence <lb/>
            should be added, that he of the citizens who did not give his <lb/>
            aid should be disgraced by public exile. The king of the- <lb/>
            Pelasgians strove to persuade, speaking concerning us a <lb/>
            speech to this effect, declaring the great wrath of Jove, that <lb/>
            never in after time [the god] would increase the city, and <lb/>
            saying that if a double pollution both to from the contempt <lb/>
            of strangers, and upon the state, should appear before the city, <lb/>
            it would be the food of irremediable calamity. Hearing such­ <lb/>
            things, the Argive people passed a decree, without a crier, <lb/>
            that these things should be: but the citizens of the Pelasgi, <lb/>
            heard the eloquent winning turns [of the king's speech:] and <lb/>
            Jove brought about a happy conclusion.</p>
          <p>CH. Come now, let us pour forth for the Argives good <lb/>
            prayers, a return for good. And may Jove, protector of <lb/>
            strangers, regard the honours of the stranger's mouth truly <lb/>
            blamelessly to full accomplishment. Now, if ever, you gods <lb/>
            sprung from Jove, hear us pouring forth prayers for desirable <lb/>
            things for this race: that bold Mars may never cause to be <lb/>
            consumed by fire the Pelasgian city, who with joyless cry <lb/>

            therefore they shall please the gods at pure altars. Therefore <lb/>
            from our mouths shaded [by boughs] let the honouring prayer <lb/>
            fly. Never let pestilence make empty the city of these men: <lb/>
            nor let [discord1] make bloody the plain of the land with <lb/>
            corses of the natives. And let the flower of youth be uncropt ; <lb/>
            nor let the paramour of Venus, man-destroying Mars mow the <lb/>
            blossom. And let the altars, at which are aged ministers, <lb/>
            abound with venerable priests, and let them blaze [with offer­ <lb/>
            ings,] that the city may be rightly ruled. Let them reverence <lb/>
            mighty Jove, the god of hospitality. supreme, who by hoary <lb/>
            law directs fate. And we pray that other rulers of the'land be <lb/>
            ever born, and that far-darting Diana look upon the labours <lb/>
            of women. Nor let any man-destroying pestilence come on, <lb/>
            laying waste this city, averse to dance and lyre, exciting tears, <lb/>
            producing Mars and clamours of the people. And let the un­ <lb/>
            joyous swarm of diseases settle at a distance from the citizens <lb/>
            in their strength : and let Lycian Apollo be propitious to all the <lb/>
            youth. And may Jove render the earth fruitful with increase <lb/>
            at all seasons: and may the herds that feed before [the city] in <lb/>
            like manner bear young abundantly. And may they receive <lb/>
            every thing from the gods, and may the divine Muses and <lb/>
            bards pour forth a well-omened strain: and from holy mouths <lb/>
            let the lyre-loving song be wafted on. And may the people hold <lb/>
            continually in honour their rulers; and may a prudent sway, <lb/>
            consulting for the common good, govern the city. And ready <lb/>
            to come to terms of peace, before preparing Mars, let them <lb/>
            afford to strangers what is just without evils. And ever let <lb/>
            them honour their country's gods, who preside over the land. <lb/>

            learnt what is just, do you yourself determine, and your fellow­ <lb/>
            voyagers. But you may lead away these willing indeed <lb/>
            according to the inclinations of their minds, if a lawful speech <lb/>
            can persuade them. But such an unanimous public decree of <lb/>
            the state has been passed, never to give up by forcr the train <lb/>
            of women. Of these things the nail is firmly driven through <lb/>
            and through, so as to remain fixed. These things are not <lb/>
            graven on tablets, nor sealed in the folds of books, but you <lb/>
            hear them plain from a free-speaking tongue ; but with all <lb/>
            speed take yourself from my eyes.</p>
          <p>HER. Know this, now you will undertake a new war : but <lb/>
            may victory and strength be to the males.</p>
          <p>PEL. But you will find males inhabitants also of this land, <lb/>
            not drinking wine made from barley. But do you all, with your <lb/>
            loved attendants, take courage, and go to the well-fortified city, <lb/>
            inclosed by a deep device of towers. And there are indeed <lb/>
            many public abodes, but I have built with no seant hand. It <lb/>
            is pleasant to inhabit well-built abodes with many others; <lb/>
            but if it be any greater pleasure, you are at liberty to dwell <lb/>
            also in abodes which hold but one family. Of these choose <lb/>
            the best and what are most pleasing. But I will be your <lb/>
            patron, and all the citizens, by whom this decree is now passed. <lb/>
            Why wait you for more powerful ones than these?</p>
          <p>CH. But in return for good things may you abound with <note type="footnote"> I Surely these verses should be allotted thus: <foreign xml:lang="grc">Βας. οὐ γὰρ .... τάδε. <lb/>

            chief adviser. For his is the first counsel, where it behoves <lb/>
            us to inhabit abodes, and [where is] a place not subject to <lb/>
            envy. Every one is ready to speak reproach against <lb/>
            foreigners : but may the best things befal.</p>
          <p>PEL. Both with fair fame, and with no wrathful rumour of <lb/>
            the people regulate yourselves in the country, 0 friendly <lb/>
            attendants, so as Danaus has assigned you to each [of his <lb/>
            daughters]a servile dowry.</p>
          <p>DAN. 0 daughters, it is fitting to pay vows to the Argives, <lb/>
            and to sacrifice and pour libations, as to the Olympian gods, <lb/>
            since they are our preservers with one mind. And they have <lb/>
            heard with indignation from me what things have been done <lb/>
            with regard to our headstrong friends, our kindred: but they <lb/>
            have appointed for me these attendants and armed guards, <lb/>
            that I might have this mark of honour, and that I might not <lb/>
            unexpectedly perish without their knowledge by the death of <lb/>
            the spear, and an everlasting pollution be upon this city. I <lb/>
            having obtained1 such things, do you observe a proper grati­ <lb/>
            titude of mind more precious2. And these things, indeed <lb/>
            write down In addition to the many other written prudent <lb/>
            sayings of your father, so as in time to convince the unknown <lb/>
            band3. But every one bears a ready evil tongue against a <lb/>
            stranger, and to speak slander is an easy thing. But I exhort <lb/>
            you not to disgrace me, being of a time of life which is at­ <lb/>
            tractive to men. And by no means is the tender mature fruit <lb/>
            easy to guard : but beasts and mortals harm it in somewise <lb/>
            and winged and four-footed animals. Venus proclaims the <lb/>
            dropping fruits: I affirm that rapine awaits them in whatever <lb/>
            way they [try to] hinder if. And on the fair-formed beauty <lb/>
            of virgins every one that passes by sends forth a melting dart <lb/>
            from his eye, overcome by desire. Therefore let us not suffer <lb/>
            those things on account of which we have had much toil, and <lb/>

            grace to us, and pleasure to my enemies. But even a double <lb/>
            dwelling is offered to us, the one, Pelasgus, and the other, the <lb/>
            city gives, to dwell apart from servants: these things are easy. <lb/>
            Only observe these injunctions of your father, honouring <lb/>
            modesty more than life.</p>
          <p>CH. In other things may we be fortunate from the gods, <lb/>
            but on account of my mature age be of good courage, father : <lb/>
            for unless something new has been determined by the gods, I <lb/>
            will not turn aside the former step of my mind. Go now <lb/>
            celebrating the blessed gods who guard the state, both those <lb/>
            inhabiting the city, and those who dwell around the ancient <lb/>
            wave of Erasinus. But do you, attendants, receive the strain': <lb/>
            and let praise possess this city of Pelasgians, nor let us adore <lb/>
            the mouths of Nile with hymns, but the rivers that pour <lb/>
            through this country a willing stream, authors of increase, <lb/>
            softening this soil of the earth with enriching weaves. And <lb/>
            may chaste Diana regard with pity this train : nor through <lb/>
            necessity let Cythercan nuptials come: but this reward is <lb/>
            hateful2. But this favouring strain neglects not Venus: for she <lb/>
            has a power over Jove together with Juno : and the nearest to <lb/>
            the many-counselled goddess is honoured for her mighty works. <lb/>
            But loved companions are present with mother [Venus], and <lb/>
            no passion is disobedient to soothing persuasion. But to <lb/>
            Harmonia is given a portion of deceiving Venus and the ways <lb/>
            of loves. Expeditions by sea against us fugitive, and dire <lb/>
            woes, and bloody wars, in truth I dread beforehand. For <lb/>
            why have they performed a lucky voyage with swift pursuit?</p>
          <p>SEMI-CH. Whatever is fated, that will take place: the <lb/>
            great immense mind of Jove is not to be transgressed. But <lb/>
            perhaps with many other nuptials this event will be according <lb/>
            to what has formerly befallen other women.</p>
          <p>SEMI-CH. 0 mighty Jove defend me from the nuptials of <lb/>
            the sons of Ægyptus.</p>
          <p>SEMI-CH. That, indeed, would be best: but you would <lb/>
            soothe [a deity] not to be soothed.</p>
          <p>SEMI-CH. But you at least knew not the future.</p>
          <p>SEMI-CH. Howcan I behold the divine mind, a fathomless <lb/>
