          </head>
          <p>THERE is little known with certainty <lb/>
            of the life of Anacreon. Chamæleon Hera- <lb/>
            cleotes,* who wrote upon the subject, has <lb/>
            been lost in the general wreck of ancient <lb/>
            literature. The editors of the poet have <lb/>
            collected the few trifling anecdotes, which <lb/>
            are scattered through the extant authors of <lb/>
            antiquity, and supplying the deficiency of <lb/>
            materials by fictions of their own imagina- <lb/>
            tion, they have arranged, what they call, a <lb/>
            life of Anacreon. These specious fabrica- <lb/>
            tions are intended to indulge that interest <lb/>
            which we naturally feel in the biography of <note type="footnote"> * He is quoted by Athenæus it <foreign xml:lang="grc">τω ϖερι τϫ ΑναϰρςΟντΟς</foreign>. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="18"/>
            illustrious men; but it is rather a dangerous <lb/>
            kind of illusion, as it confounds the limits <lb/>
            of history and romancer and is too often <lb/>
            supported by unfaithful citation. t</p>
          <p>Our poet was born in the city of T2os, <lb/>
            in the delicious region of Ionia, where every <lb/>
            thing respired voluptuousness. ‡ The time <note type="footnote"> * The History of Anacreon, by Monsieur Gaçon <lb/>
            (le poëte sans fard), is professedly a romance; nor <lb/>
            does Mademoiselle Scuderi, from whom he borrowed <lb/>
            the idea, pretend to historical veracity in her account <lb/>
            of Anacreon and Sappho. These, then, are allowable. <lb/>
            But how can Barnes be forgiven, who, with all the <lb/>
            confidence of a biographer, traces every wandering <lb/>
            of the poet, and settles him in his old age at a country <lb/>
            villa near Teos ? </note><note type="footnote"> † The learned Monsieur Bayle has detected some <lb/>
            infidelities of quotation in Le Fevre. See Dictionaire <lb/>
            Historique, &amp;c. Madame Dacier is not more accurate <lb/>
            than her father: they have almost made Anacreon <lb/>
            prime minister to the monarch of Samos. </note><note type="footnote"> ‡ The Asiatics were as remarkable for genius as for <lb/>
            luxury. “ Ingenia Asiatica inclyta per gentes fecêre <lb/>
            Poetæ, Anacreon, inde Mimnermus et Antimachus," <lb/>
            &amp;c. Solinus. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="19"/>
            of his birth appears to have been in the sixth <lb/>
            century before Christ, and he flourished <lb/>
            at that remarkable period, when, under the <lb/>
            polished tyrants Hipparchus and Polycrates, <lb/>
            Athens and Samos were the rival asylums of <lb/>
            genius. The name of his father is doubt- <lb/>
            ful, and therefore cannot be very interesting. <lb/>
            His family was, perhaps, illustrious; but <lb/>
            those who discover in Plato that he was a <lb/>
            descendant of the monarch Codrus, exhibit, <lb/>
            as usual, more zeal than accuracy. t <note type="footnote"> * I have not attempted to define the particular <lb/>
            Olympiad, but have adopted the idea of Bayle, who <lb/>
            says, “ Je n'ai point marqué d'Olympiade; car pour <lb/>
            un homme qui a vecu 85 ans, il me semble que l'on <lb/>
            ne doit point s'enfermer dans des bornes si etroites." </note><note type="footnote"> † This mistake is founded on a false interpretation <lb/>
            of a very obvious passage in Plato's Dialogue on <lb/>
            Temperance; it originated with Madame Dacier, <lb/>
            and has been received implicitly by many. Gail, a <lb/>
            late editor of Anacreon, seems to claim to himself <lb/>
            the merit of detecting this error; but Bayle had <lb/>
            observed it before him. </note></p><pb n="20"/>
            
          <p>The disposition and talents of Anacreon <lb/>
            recommended him to the monarch of Samos, <lb/>
            and he was formed to be the friend of such <lb/>
            a prince as Polycrates. Susceptible only <lb/>
            to the pleasures, he felt not the corruptions <lb/>
            of the court; and while Pythagoras fled <lb/>
            from the tyrant, Anacreon was celebrating <lb/>
            his praises on the lyre. We are told too <lb/>
            by Maximus Tyrius, that by the influence <lb/>
            of his amatory songs, he softened the mind <lb/>
            of Polycrates into a spirit of benevolence <lb/>
            towards his subjects.*</p>
          <p>The amours of the poet, and the rival- <lb/>
            ship of the tyrant, † I shall pass over in <note type="footnote"> * <foreign xml:lang="grc">Αναϰρεον Σαμιοις Πολυϰρατην ἡμερωσε</foreign>. Maxim. <lb/>
            Tyr. § 21. Maximus Tyrius mentions this among <lb/>
            other instances of the influence of poetry. If Gail <lb/>
            had read Maximus Tyrius, how could he ridicule <lb/>
            this idea in Moutonnet, as unauthenticated ? </note><note type="footnote"> † In the romance of Clelia, the anecdote to which I <lb/>
            allude is told of a young girl, with whom Anacreon <lb/>
            fell in love while she personated the god Apollo in </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="21"/>
            silence; and there are few, I presume, who <lb/>
            will regret the omission of most of those <lb/>
            anecdotes, which the industry of some edi- <lb/>
            tors has not only promulged, but discussed. <lb/>
            Whatever is repugnant to modesty and vir- <lb/>
            tue is considered in ethical science, by a <lb/>
            supposition very favourable to humanity, <lb/>
            as impossible; and this amiable persuasion <lb/>
            should be much more strongly entertained, <lb/>
            where the transgression wars with nature <lb/>
            as well as virtue. But why are we not <lb/>
            allowed to indulge in the presumption? <lb/>
            Why are we officiously reminded that there <lb/>
            have been such instances of depravity ?</p>
          <p>Hipparchus, who now maintained at <lb/>
            Athens the power which his father Pisis- <lb/>
            tratus had usurped, was one of those ele- <lb/>
            gant princes who have polished the fetters <note type="footnote"> a mask. But here Mademoiselle Scuderi consulted <lb/>
            nature more than truth. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="22"/>
            of their subjects. He was the first, accord- <lb/>
            ing to Plato, who edited the poems of Ho- <lb/>
            mer, and commanded them to be sung by <lb/>
            the rhapsodists at the celebration of the <lb/>
            Panathenæa. As his court was the galaxy <lb/>
            of genius, Anacreon should not be absent. <lb/>
            Hipparchus sent a barge for him; the poet <lb/>
            embraced the invitation, and the muses and <lb/>
            the loves were wafted with him to Athens.*</p>
          <p>The manner of Anacreon's death was <lb/>
            singular. We are told that in the eighty- <lb/>
            fifth year of his age he was choked by a <lb/>
            grape-stone ; † and however we may smile <note type="footnote"> * There is a very interesting French poem founded <lb/>
            upon this anecdote, imputed to Desyvetaux, and <lb/>
            called “ Anacreon Citoyen.” </note><note type="footnote"> †t Fabricius appears not to trust very implicitly in <lb/>
            this story. “ Uvæ passæ acino tandem suffocatus, <lb/>
            si credimus Suidæ in <foreign xml:lang="grc">οινοποτης</foreign> ; alii enim hoc mortis <lb/>
            genere periisse tradunt Sophoclem." Fabricii Bib- <lb/>
            bliothec. Græc. lib. ii. cap. 15. It must be confessed <lb/>
            that Lucian, who tells us that Sophocles was choked <lb/>
            by a grape-stone, in the very same treatise mentions </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="23"/>
            at their enthusiastic partiality, who pretend <lb/>
            that it was a peculiar indulgence of Heaven <lb/>
            which stole him from the world by this <lb/>
            easy and characteristic death, we cannot <lb/>
            help admiring that his fate should be so <lb/>
            emblematic of. his disposition. Cælius <lb/>
            Calcagninus alludes to this catastrophe in <lb/>
            the following epitaph on our poet: <lb/>
            * Then, hallow'd Sage, those lips which pour’d along <lb/>
            The sweetest lapses of the cygnet's song, <lb/>
            A grape has clos'd forever! <lb/>
            Here let the ivy kiss the poet's tomb, <lb/>
            Here let the rose he lov'd with laurels bloom, <lb/>
            In bands that ne'er shall sever! <note type="footnote"> the longevity of Anacreon, and yet is silent on the <lb/>
            manner of his death. Could he have been ignorant <lb/>
            of such a remarkable coincidence, or, knowing, could <lb/>
            he have neglected to remark it? See Regnier's in- <lb/>
            troduction to his Anacreon. </note> <note type="footnote"> * At te, sancte senex, acinus sub tartara misit; <lb/>
            Cygneæ clausit qui tibi vocis iter. <lb/>
            Vos, hederæ, tumulum, tumulum vos cingite lauri, <lb/>

            But far be thou, oh ! far, unholy vine, <lb/>
            By whom the favourite minstrel of the Nine <lb/>
            Expir'd his rosy breath ; <lb/>
            Thy god himself now blushes to confess, <lb/>
            Unholy vine ! he feels he loves thee less, <lb/>
            Since poor Anacreon's death!</p>
          <p>There can scarcely be imagined a more <lb/>
            delightful theme for the warmest specula- <lb/>
            tions of fancy to wanton upon, than the <lb/>
            idea of an intercourse between Anacreon <lb/>

            ment not to be found in any other ancient <lb/>
            poet. Love, at that period, was rather an <lb/>
            unrefined emotion; and the intercourse of <lb/>
            the sexes was animated more by passion <lb/>
            than sentiment. They knew not those little <lb/>

            sweetness of his style." Henry Stephen remarks <lb/>
            the same beauty in a note on the forty-fourth Ode. <lb/>
            This figure of iteration is his most appropriate grace. <lb/>
            The modern writers of Juvenilia and Rasia have <lb/>

            was therefore rude and unvaried, and the <lb/>
            poetry of love deprived of its most capti- <lb/>
            vating graces. Anacreon, however, attained <lb/>
            some ideas of this gallantry; and the same <lb/>
            delicacy of mind which led him to this re- <lb/>
            finement, prevented him from yielding to <lb/>
            the freedom of language, which has sullied <lb/>
            the pages of all the other poets. His <lb/>
            descriptions are warm; but the warmth <lb/>
            is in the ideas, not the words. He is <lb/>
            sportive without being wanton, and ardent <lb/>
            without being licentious. His poetic inven- <lb/>
            tion is most brilliantly displayed in those <lb/>
            allegorical fictions, which so many have <lb/>
            endeavoured to imitate, because all have <lb/>
            confessed them to be inimitable. Simplicity <lb/>
            is the distinguishing feature of these odes, <lb/>
            and they interest by their innocence, while <lb/>
            they fascinate by their beauty; they are, <lb/>
            indeed, the infants of the Muses, and may <lb/>

            this should not be the language of a trans- <lb/>

          <p>In the age of Anacreon music and poetry <lb/>
            were inseparable. These kindred talents <lb/>
            were for a long time associated, and the <lb/>
            poet always sung his own compositions to <lb/>
            the lyre. It is probable that they were not set <lb/>
            to any regular air, but rather a kind of musi- <lb/>
            cal recitation, which was varied according <lb/>
            to the fancy and feelings of the moment.* <note type="footnote"> * In the Paris edition there are four of the original <lb/>
            odes set to music, by Citizens Le Sueur, Gossec, <lb/>
            Mehul, and Cherubini. “ On chante du Latin et de <lb/>
            l'Italien," says Gail, " quelquefois même sans les <lb/>
            entendre; qui empeche que nous ne chantions des <lb/>
            odes Grecques?" The chromatic learning of these <lb/>
            composers is very unlike what we are told of the <lb/>
            simple melody of the ancients; and they have all <lb/>
            mistaken the accentuation of the words. </note> <lb/>

            The poems of Anacreon were sung at ban- <lb/>
            quets as late as the time of Aulus Gellius, <lb/>

            performed at a birth-day entertainment.*</p>
          <p>The singular beauty of our poet's style, <lb/>
            and perhaps the careless facility with which <lb/>
            he appears to have trifled, have induced, as <lb/>
            I remarked, a number of imitations. Some <lb/>
            have succeeded with wonderful felicity, as <lb/>
            may be discerned in a few odes which are <lb/>
            attributed to writers of a later period. But <lb/>
            none of his emulators have been so danger- <lb/>
            ous to his fame as those Greek ecclesiastics <lb/>
            of the early ages, who, conscious of infe- <lb/>
            riority to their prototypes, determined on <lb/>

            elegant, are always laboured. The beauti- <lb/>

            more happily than any the delicate turn of <lb/>
            those allegorical fables, which, frequently <lb/>
            passing through the mediums of version <lb/>

            Farre, Chaulieu, and the other light poets <lb/>
            of France, have professed too to cultivate <lb/>
            the muse of Teos; but they have attained <lb/>
            all her negligence with little of the grace <lb/>
            that embellishes it. In the delicate bard of <lb/>
            Schiras* we find the kindred spirit of <lb/>
            Anacreon: some of his gazelles, or songs, <lb/>
            possess all the character of our poet.</p>
          <p>We come now to a retrospect of the <lb/>
            editions of Anacreon. To Henry Stephen <lb/>
            we are indebted for having first recovered <lb/>
            his remains from the obscurity in which <lb/>
            they had reposed for so many ages. He <lb/>
            found the seventh Ode, as we are told, on <lb/>
            the cover of an old book, and communicated <lb/>
            it to Victorius, who mentions the circum- <note type="footnote"> * See Toderini on the learning of the Turks, as <lb/>

            stance in his “ Various Readings.” Stephen <lb/>
            was then very young; and this discovery <lb/>
            was considered by some critics of that day <lb/>
            as a literary imposition.* In 1554, however <lb/>
            he gave Anacreon to the world, t accompa- <lb/>
            nied with annotations and a Latin version <lb/>
            of the greater part of the odes. The learned <lb/>
            still hesitated to receive them as the relics <lb/>
            of the Teian bard, and suspected them to <lb/>
            be the fabrication of some monks of the <lb/>
            sixteenth century. This was an idea from <note type="footnote"> * Robertellus, in his work “ De Ratione corrigendi," <lb/>

            which the classic muse recoiled; and the <lb/>
            Vatican MS. consulted by Scaliger and <lb/>
            Salmasius, confirmed the antiquity of most <lb/>
            of the poems. A very inaccurate copy of <lb/>
            this MS. was taken by Isaac Vossius, and <lb/>
            this is the authority which Barnes has <lb/>
            followed in his collation; accordingly he <lb/>

            him, have spoken of the manuscript with <lb/>
            not less confidence than ignorance. The <lb/>
            literary world has at length been gratified <lb/>
            with this curious memorial of the poet, by <lb/>
            the industry of the Abbé Spaletti, who, in <lb/>

          <p>As late I sought the spangled bowers, <lb/>
            To cull a wreath of matin flowers, <lb/>
            Where many an early rose was weeping, <lb/>
            I found the urchin Cupid sleeping.</p>
          <p>The Vatican MS. pronounces this beautiful fiction <lb/>
            to be the genuine offspring of Anacreon. It has all the <lb/>
            features of the parent: <lb/>
            et facile insciis <lb/>
            Noscitetur ab omnibus. <lb/>

            I caught him by his downy wing, <lb/>
            And whelm'd him in the racy spring.</p>
          <p>Mox ubi lacteolas et dignas matre papillas <lb/>
            Vidit et ora ipsos nata movere Deos, <lb/>

            A wreath of many mingled flowrets wove, <lb/>
            Within a rose a sleeping Love she found, <lb/>
            And in the twisted wreaths the baby bound. <lb/>
            Awhile he struggled, and impatient tried <lb/>
            To break the rosy bonds the virgin tied; <lb/>
            But when he saw her bosom's milky swell, <lb/>
            Her features, where the eye of Jove might dwell; <lb/>
            And caught th' ambrosial odours of her hair, <lb/>
            Rich as the breathings of Arabian air; <lb/>
            " Oh! mother Venus" (said the raptur'd child, <lb/>
            By charms, of more than mortal bloom, beguil'd) <lb/>

          <p>TELL me how to punish thee, <lb/>
            For the mischief done to me? <lb/>
            Silly swallow! prating thing, <lb/>
            Shall I clip that wheeling wing ?</p>
          <p>This ode is addressed to a swallow. I find from <lb/>
            Degen and from Gail's index, that the German poet <lb/>
            Weisse has imitated it, Scherz. Lieder. lib. ii. carm. 5 ; <lb/>
            that Ramler also has imitated it, Lyr. Blumenlese, lib. <lb/>
            iv. p. 335; and some others. See Gail de Editionibus.</p>
          <p>We are referred by Degen to that stupid book, the <lb/>
            Epistles of Alciphron, tenth epistle, third book; where <lb/>
            Iophon complains to Eraston of being wakened by the <lb/>
            crowing of a cock from his vision of riches.</p>
          <p>Silly swallow! prating thing, &amp;c.] The loquacity of <lb/>
            the swallow wa sproverbialized; thus Nicostratus: <figure type="illustration">

              If in prating from morning till night, <lb/>
              A sign of our wisdom there be; <lb/>
              The swallows are wiser by right, <lb/>
              For they prattle much faster than we.</p><pb n="70"/>
              
          <p>Or, as Tereus did of old <lb/>
            (So the fabled tale is told) <lb/>
            Shall I tear that tongue away, <lb/>
            Tongue that uttered such a lay? <lb/>
            How unthinking hast thou been! <lb/>
            Long before the dawn was seen, <lb/>
            When I slumbered in a dream, <lb/>
            (Love was the delicious theme!) <lb/>
            Just when I was nearly blest, <lb/>
            Ah! thy matin broke my rest!</p>

            confirmed the name of Philomel upon the nightin- <lb/>
            gale ; but many very respectable ancients assigned <lb/>
            this metamorphose to Progne, and made Philomel <lb/>
            the swallow, as Anacreon does here.</p><pb n="71"/>

          <p>I WILL; I will; the conflicts past, <lb/>
            And I'll consent to love at last. <lb/>
            Cupid has long, with smiling art, <lb/>
            Invited me to yield my heart; <lb/>
            And I have thought that peace of mind <lb/>
            Should not be for a smile resign'd; <lb/>
            And I've repell'd the tender lure, <lb/>
            And hop'd my heart should sleep secure. <lb/>
            But, slighted in his boasted charms, <lb/>
            The angry infant flew to arms; <lb/>
            He slung his quivers golden frame, <lb/>
            He took his bow, his shafts of flame, <lb/>
            And proudly summoned me to yield, <lb/>
            Or meet him on the martial field. <lb/>
            And what did I unthinking do ? <lb/>
            I took to arms, undaunted too;</p>
          <p>And what did I unthinking do ? <lb/>
            I took to arms, undaunted too;] Longepierre has <lb/>

          <p>With Reason I cover my breast as a shield, <lb/>

            Thus fighting his godship, I'll ne'er be dismayed, <lb/>

            Alas! then, unable to combat the two, <lb/>
            Unfortunate warrior I what should I do ?</p>
          <p>This idea of the irresistibility of Cupid and <lb/>
            Bacchus united, is delicately expressed in an Italian <lb/>
            poem, which is so very Anacreontic, that I may <lb/>
            be pardoned for introducing it. Indeed, it is an <lb/>
            imitation of our poet's sixth ode.</p>
          <p>Lavossi Amore in quel vicino fiume <lb/>

          <p>Then (hear it, all you powers above!) <lb/>
            I fought with Love! I fought with Love! <lb/>
            And now his arrows all were shed- <lb/>
            And I had just in terrors fled- <lb/>
            When, heaving an indignant sigh, <lb/>
            To see me thus unwounded fly,</p>
          <p>The urchin of the bow and quiver <lb/>
            Was bathing in a neighbouring river, <lb/>

            (Shepherd-youth! the tale believe,) <lb/>
            'Twas not a cooling, crystal draught, <lb/>
            'Twas liquid flame I madly quaff'd; <lb/>
            For Love was in the rippling tide, <lb/>
            I felt him to my bosom glide. <lb/>
            And now the wily, wanton minion <lb/>
            Plays o'er my heart with restless pinion. <lb/>
            This was a day of fatal star, <lb/>
            But were it not more fatal far, <lb/>
            If, Bacchus, in thy cup of fire, <lb/>
            I found this fluttering, young desire? <lb/>
            Then, then indeed my soul should prove, <lb/>
            Much more than ever, drunk with love!</p><pb n="78"/>
            
          <p>And, having now no other dart, <lb/>
            He glanced himself into my heart! <lb/>
            My heart-alas the luckless day! <lb/>
            Received the God, and died away. <lb/>
            Farewel, farewel, my faithless shield! <lb/>
            Thy lord at length is forc'd to yield. <lb/>
            Vain, vain, is every outward care, <lb/>
            My foe's within, and triumphs there.</p>
          <p>And, having left no other dart, <lb/>
            He glanc'd himself into my heart !] Dryden has <lb/>
            parodied this thought in the following extravagant <lb/>
            lines: <lb/>
            —— I'm all o'er Love; <lb/>
            Nay, I am Love, Love shot, and shot so fast, <lb/>
            He shot himself into my breast at last.</p><pb n="79"/>

            of the verb <foreign xml:lang="grc">ϰορινθιαζειν</foreign>, in Aristophanes, that the <lb/>
            wantonness of the Corinthians became proverbial.</p>

            Greece." Degen.</p>
          <p>Monsieur de Pauw, the author of Dissertations <lb/>
            upon the Greeks, is of a different opinion; he <lb/>
            thinks, that by a capricious partiality of nature, <lb/>
            the other sex had all the beauty, and accounts <lb/>

            " Les danses sont presque toutes des pantomimes <lb/>
            d'amour; le plan, le dessein, les attitudes, les <lb/>
            mesures, les sons et les cadences de ces ballets, <lb/>

          <p>The music of the Gaditanian females had all the <lb/>

          <p>THOU, whose soft and rosy hues <lb/>

            Best of painters! come portray <lb/>
            The lovely maid that's far away.</p>
          <p>This ode and the next may be called companion- <lb/>
            pictures ; they are highly finished, and give us an <lb/>
            excellent idea of the taste of the ancients in beauty. <lb/>
            Franciscus Junius quotes them in his third book <lb/>
            " De Pictura Veterum."</p>
          <p>This ode has been imitated by Ronsard, Giuliano <lb/>
            Goselini, &amp;c. See. Scaliger alludes to it thus in his <lb/>
            Anacreontica:</p>
          <p>Olim lepore blander <lb/>
            Litis versibus <lb/>
            Candidus Anacreon <lb/>
            Quam pingeret Amicus <lb/>
            Descripsit Venerem suam.</p>
          <p>The Teian bard, of former days, <lb/>
            Attun'd his sweet descriptive lays, <lb/>
            And taught the painter's hand to trace <lb/>
            His fair beloved's every grace!</p><pb n="91"/>
            
          <p>Far away, my soul! thou art, <lb/>
            But I've thy beauties all by heart. <lb/>
            Paint her jetty ringlets straying, <lb/>
            Silky twine in tendrils playing;</p>
          <p>In the dialogue of Caspar Barlæus, entitled " An <lb/>
            formosa sit ducenda," the reader will find many <lb/>
            curious ideas and descriptions of beauty.</p>
          <p>Thou, whose soft and rosy hues <lb/>
            Mimic form, and soul infuse;] I have followed the <lb/>
            reading of the Vatican MS. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ϱοδεης</foreign>. Painting is called <lb/>
            " the rosy art," either in reference to colouring, or <lb/>
            as an indefinite epithet of excellence, from the <lb/>
            association of beauty with that flower. Salvini has <lb/>
            adopted this reading in his literal translation: <lb/>
            Della rosea arte signore.</p>
          <p>The lovely maid that's far away.] If the portrait <lb/>
            of this beauty be not merely ideal, the omission of <lb/>
            her name is much to be regretted. Meleager, in <lb/>
            an epigram on Anacreon, mentions " the golden <lb/>
            Eurypyle" as his mistress.</p><figure type="illustration">

          <p>Paint her jetty ringlets straying, <lb/>
            Silky twine in tendrils playing;] The ancients <lb/>
            have been very enthusiastic in their praises of hair. <lb/>
            Apuleius, in the second book of his Milesiacs, says,</p><pb n="92"/>
            
          <p>And, if painting hath the skill <lb/>
            To make the spicy balm distil, <lb/>
            Let every little lock exhale <lb/>
            A sigh of perfume on the gale.</p>
          <p>that Venus herself, if she were bald, though sur- <lb/>
            rounded by the Graces and the Loves, could not be <lb/>
            pleasing even to her husband Vulcan.</p>
          <p>Stesichorus gave the epithet <foreign xml:lang="grc">ϰαλλιπλοϰαμος</foreign> to the <lb/>
            Graces, and Simonides bestowed the same upon the <lb/>
            Muses. See Hadrian Junius's Dissertation upon Hair.</p>
          <p>To this passage of our poet, Selden alluded in a <lb/>
            note on the Polyolbion of Drayton, song the second, <lb/>
            where observing, that the epithet " black-haired" <lb/>
            was given by some of the ancients to the goddess <lb/>
            Isis, he says, " Nor will I swear, but that Anacreon <lb/>
            (a man very judicious in the provoking motives <lb/>
            of wanton love), intending to bestow on his sweet <lb/>
            mistress that one of the titles of women's special <lb/>
            ornament, well-chaired thought of <lb/>
            this when he gave his painter direction to make <lb/>
            her black-haired."</p>

            Burnish'd as the ivory bright. <lb/>
            Let her eyebrows sweetly rise <lb/>
            In jetty arches o'er her eyes, <lb/>
            Gently in a crescent gliding, <lb/>
            Just commingling, just dividing. <lb/>
            But hast thou any sparkles warm, <lb/>
            The lightning of her eyes to form? <lb/>
            Let them effuse the azure ray, <lb/>

          <p>And give them all that liquid fire, <lb/>
            That Venus' languid eyes respire.] Marchetti <lb/>

            Quai gli ha Ciprigna l'alma Dea d'Amore.</p>
          <p>Tasso has painted in the same manner the eyes <lb/>
            of Armida, as La Fosse remarks:</p><pb n="94"/>
            
          <p>O'er her nose and cheek be shed <lb/>
            Flushing white and mellowed red; <lb/>
            Gradual tints, as when there glows <lb/>
            In snowy milk the bashful rose.</p>
          <p>Qual raggio in onda le scintilla un riso <lb/>

          <p>Within her humid, melting eyes <lb/>
            A brilliant ray of laughter lies, <lb/>
            Soft as the broken, solar beam, <lb/>
            That trembles in the azure stream.</p>
          <p>The mingled expression of dignity and tenderness, <lb/>
            which Anacreon requires the painter to infuse into <lb/>
            the eyes of his mistress, is more amply described <lb/>
            in the subsequent ode. Both descriptions are so <lb/>
            exquisitely touched, that the artist must have been <lb/>
            great indeed, if he did not yield in painting to the <lb/>
            poet.</p>
          <p>Gradual tints, as when there glows <lb/>

          <p>Then her lift, so rich in blisses! <lb/>
            Sweet petitioner for kisses !] The " lip, provoking <lb/>
            kisses," in the original, is a strong and beautiful <lb/>

            kiss infinitely sweeter than others! " Suavius viros <lb/>

            Lucretia, where he particularizes the beauties of <lb/>
            the heroine (in a very false and laboured style of <lb/>
            latinity), describes her lips as exquisitely adapted, <lb/>
            for biting. " Os parvum decensque, labia corallini <lb/>

            Portray Bathyllus, lovely youth! <lb/>
            Let his hair, in lapses bright, <lb/>

          <p>The reader, who wishes to acquire an accurate <lb/>
            idea of the judgment of the ancients in beauty, <lb/>
            will be indulged by consulting Junius de Pictura <lb/>
            Veterum, ninth chapter, third book, where he will <lb/>
            find a very curious selection of descriptions and <lb/>
            epithets of personal perfections; he compares this <lb/>
            ode with a description of Theodoric, king of the <lb/>
            Goths, in the second epistle, first book of Sidonius <lb/>
            Apollinaris.</p>

            describes the sunny hair, " the flava coma," which <lb/>
            the ancients so much admired. The Romans gave <lb/>
            this colour artificially to their hair. See Stanisl. <lb/>

            original here, which is particularly beautiful, can <lb/>
            admit of any additional value, that value is conferred <lb/>
            by Gray's admiration of it. See his letters to West.</p>
          <p>Some annotators have quoted on this passage <lb/>

            a Latin version of them from a manuscript which <lb/>

            Shakspeare's Cymbeline there is a similar method <lb/>

            Mercury was also the patron of thieves, and may <lb/>

            taken the liberty here of somewhat veiling the <lb/>
            original. Madame Dacier, in her translation, has <lb/>
            hung out lights (as Sterne would call it) at this <lb/>
            passage. It is very much to be regretted, that this <lb/>
            substitution of asterisks has been so much adopted <lb/>
            in the popular interpretations of the Classics; it <lb/>
            serves but to bring whatever is exceptionable into <lb/>
            notice, " claramque facem præferre pudendis."</p><pb n="104"/>
            
          <p>Which now in veiling shadow lies, <lb/>
            Removed from all but Fancy's eyes. <lb/>
            Now, for his feet-but hold-forbear- <lb/>
            I see a godlike portrait there; <lb/>
            So like Bathyllus!—sure there's none <lb/>
            So like Bathyllus but the sun! <lb/>
            Oh! let this pictured god be mine, <lb/>
            And keep the boy for Samos' shrine; <lb/>
            Phœbus shall then Bathyllus be, <lb/>
            Bathyllus then the deity!</p>
          <p>—But hold—forbear— <lb/>
            I see a godlike portrait there; &amp;c.] This is very <lb/>
            spirited, but it requires explanation. While the artist <lb/>
            is pursuing the portrait of Bathyllus, Anacreon, we <lb/>
            must suppose, turns round and sees a picture of <lb/>
            Apollo, which was intended for an altar at Samos; <lb/>
            he instantly tells the painter to cease his work; that <lb/>
            this picture will serve for Bathyllus; and that, when <lb/>
            he goes to Samos, he may make an Apollo of the <lb/>
            portrait of the boy which he had begun.</p>
          <p>" Bathyllus (says Madame Dacier) could not be <lb/>
            more elegantly praised, and this one passage does <lb/>
            him more honour than the statue, however beautiful <lb/>
            it might be, which Polycrates raised to him."</p><pb n="105"/>

          <p>In the Veneres Blyenburgicæ, under the head <lb/>

          <p>ONE day, the Muses twin'd the hands <lb/>
            Of baby Love, with flow'ry bands; <lb/>
            And to celestial Beauty gave <lb/>
            The captive infant as her slave.</p>
          <p>By this allegory of the Muses making Cupid the <lb/>
            prisoner of Beauty, Anacreon seems to insinuate <lb/>
            the softening influence which a cultivation of poetry <lb/>
            has over the mind, in making it peculiarly suscepti- <lb/>
            ble to the impressions of beauty.</p>
          <p>Though in the following epigram, by the philoso- <lb/>
            pher Plato, which is found in the third book of <lb/>
            Diogenes Laertius, the Muses are made to disavow <lb/>
            all the influence of Love.</p><figure type="illustration">

          <p>" Yield to my gentle power, Parnassian maids <lb/>
            Thus to the Muses spoke the Queen of Charms; <lb/>

            And make your grove the camp of Paphian arms !"</p><pb n="112"/>

            A chi scioglie il figliuol la bella dea <lb/>
            Da tanti nodi, in ch' ella stretto il vede. <lb/>
            Ma ei vinto a due occhi l' arme cede: <lb/>

          <p>Love, wandering through the golden maze <lb/>
            Of my beloved's hair, <lb/>
            Traced every lock with fond delays, <lb/>

          <p>And soon he found 'twere vain to fly, <lb/>
            His heart was close confin'd; <lb/>
            And every curlet was a tie, <lb/>
            A chain by Beauty twin'd.</p>

          <p>Nay, should they take his chains away, <lb/>
            The little captive still would stay. <lb/>
            " If this," he cries, " a bondage be, <lb/>

            Shall have something more rapturous, something <lb/>

            She drinks the droppings of the sky; <lb/>

          <p>The commentators who have endeavoured to <lb/>
            throw the chains of precision over the spirit of this <lb/>
            beautiful trifle, require too much from Anacreontic <lb/>
            philosophy. Monsieur Gail very wisely thinks that <lb/>
            the poet uses the epithet <foreign xml:lang="grc">μελαινη</foreign>, because black earth <lb/>
            absorbs moisture more quickly than any other; and <lb/>
            accordingly he indulges us with an experimental <lb/>
            disquisition on the subject. See Gail's notes.</p>
          <p>One of the Capilupi has imitated this ode, in an <lb/>
            epitaph on a drunkard:</p>
          <p>Dum vixi sine fine bibi, sic imbrifer arcus <lb/>
            Sic tellus pluvias sole perusta bibit. <lb/>
            Sic bibit assidue fontes et Rumina Pontus, <lb/>
            Sic semper sitiens Sol marts haurit aquas. <lb/>
            Ne te igitur jactes plus me, Silene, bibisse; <lb/>
            Et mihi da victas tu quoque, Bacche, manus. <lb/>
            Hippolytus Capilupus.</p><pb n="116"/>
            
          <p>The vapours, which at evening weep, <lb/>
            Are beverage to the swelling deep; <lb/>
            And when the rosy sun appears, <lb/>
            He drinks the ocean's misty tears.</p>
          <p>While life was mine, the little hour <lb/>
            In drinking still unvaried flew; <lb/>
            I drank as earth imbibes the shower, <lb/>
            Or as the rainbow drinks the dew; <lb/>
            As ocean quaffs the rivers up, <lb/>
            Or flushing sun inhales the sea: <lb/>
            Silenus trembled at my cup, <lb/>
            And Bacchus was outdone by me!</p>
          <p>I cannot omit citing those remarkable lines of <lb/>
            Shakspeare, where the thoughts of the ode before <lb/>
            us are preserved with such striking similitude:</p>

            The sea's a thief, whose liquid surge resolves <lb/>
            The mounds into salt tears. The earth's a thief, <lb/>

          <p>THE Phrygian rock, that braves the storm, <lb/>
            Was once a weeping matrons form; <lb/>
            And Progne, hapless, frantic maid, <lb/>
            Is now a swallow in the shade.</p>
          <p>Ogilvie, in his Essay on the Lyric Poetry of the <lb/>
            Ancients, in remarking upon the Odes of Anacreon, <lb/>
            says, " In some of his pieces there is exuberance and <lb/>
            even wildness of imagination; in that particularly, <lb/>
            which is addressed to a young girl, where he wishes <lb/>
            alternately to be transformed to a mirror, a coat, a <lb/>
            stream, a bracelet, and a pair of shoes, for the <lb/>
            different purposes which he recites: this is mere <lb/>
            sport and wantonness."</p>
          <p>It is the wantonness however of a very graceful <lb/>
            Muse; ludit amabiliter. The compliment of this <lb/>
            ode is exquisitely delicate, and so singular for the <lb/>
            period in which Anacreon lived, when the scale of <lb/>
            love had not yet been graduated into all its little <lb/>
            progressive refinements, that if we were inclined to <lb/>
            question the authenticity of the poem, we should <lb/>
            find a much more plausible argument in the features <lb/>
            of modern gallantry which it bears, than in any</p><pb n="119"/>

            it spurious, and De Pauw pronounces it to be <lb/>
            miserable. Longepierre and Barnes refer us to <lb/>
            several imitations of this ode, from which I shall <lb/>
            only select an epigram of Dionysius:</p><figure type="illustration">

          <p>To all that breathe the airs of heaven, <lb/>

          <p>Henry Stephen has imitated the idea of this ode <lb/>

          <p>Provida dat cunctis Natura animantibus arma, <lb/>
            Et sua faemineum possidet arma genus, <lb/>
            Ungulaque ut defendit equum, a,tque ut cornua taurum, <lb/>

          <p>And the same thought occurs in those lines, <lb/>
            spoken by Corisca in Pastor Fido:</p>
          <p>Cosi noi la bellezza <lb/>

          <p>She arm'd the coursers foot of air, <lb/>
            And winged with speed the panting hare. <lb/>
            She gave the lion fangs of terror, <lb/>

            She gave thee beauty-blush of fire, <lb/>

            of the compliment, to prefer the radiance of female <lb/>

          <p>Thou! of tuneful bards the first, <lb/>
            Thou! by all the graces nurst; <lb/>
            Friend! each other friend above, <lb/>
            Come with me, and learn to love. <lb/>
            Loving is a simple lore, <lb/>
            Graver men have leaned before; <lb/>
            Nay, the boast of former ages, <lb/>
            Wisest of the wisest sages,</p><pb n="142"/>
            
          <p>Nor heavenly virtue, can beguile <lb/>
            From beauty's cheek one favouring smile. <lb/>
            Gold is the woman's only theme, <lb/>
            Gold is the woman's only dream.</p>
          <p>Sophroniscus' prudent son, <lb/>
            Was by lovers illusion won, <lb/>
            Oh! how heavy life would move, <lb/>
            If we knew not how to love! <lb/>
            Lovers a whetstone to the mind; <lb/>
            Thus 'tis pointed, thus refined. <lb/>
            When the soul dejected lies, <lb/>
            Love can waft it to the skies; <lb/>
            When in languor sleeps the heart, <lb/>
            Love can wake it with his dart; <lb/>
            When the mind is dull and dark, <lb/>
            Love can light it with his spark. <lb/>
            Come, oh! come then, let us haste <lb/>
            All the bliss of love to taste; <lb/>
            Let us love both night and day, <lb/>
            Let us love our lives away! <lb/>
            And when hearts, from loving free, <lb/>
            (If indeed such hearts there be,) <lb/>
            Frown upon our gentle flame, <lb/>
            And the sweet delusion blame; <lb/>
            This shall be my only curse, <lb/>
            (Could I, could I wish them worse?) <lb/>
            May they ne'er the rapture prove <lb/>
            Of the smile from lips we love!</p><pb n="143"/>
            
          <p>Oh! never be that wretch forgiven- <lb/>
            Forgive him not, indignant heaven! <lb/>
            Whose grovelling eyes could first adore, <lb/>
            Whose heart could pant for sordid ore. <lb/>
            Since that devoted thirst began, <lb/>
            Man has forgot to feel for man; <lb/>
            The pulse of social life is dead, <lb/>
            And all its fonder feelings fled! <lb/>
            War too has sullied Nature's charms, <lb/>
            For gold provokes the world to arms! <lb/>
            And oh! the worst of all its art, <lb/>

          <p>'TWAS in an airy dream of night, <lb/>
            I fancied, that I winged my flight <lb/>

            (I know not why) with chains of lead, <lb/>
            Pursued me as I trembling fled; <lb/>
            Pursued-and could I e'er have thought ?— <lb/>

            What does the wanton Fancy mean <lb/>

          <p>Barnes imagines from this allegory, that our poet <lb/>
            married very late in life. I do not perceive any <lb/>
            thing in the ode which seems to allude to matrimony, <lb/>
            except it be the lead upon the feet of Cupid; and I <lb/>
            must confess that I agree in the opinion of Madame <lb/>
            Dacier, in her life of the poet, that he was always <lb/>
            too fond of pleasure to marry.</p><pb n="145"/>

            By tangled brake and pendent steep, <lb/>
            With weary foot I panting flew, <lb/>
            My brow was chill with drops of dew.</p>

            My languid eyes in magic slumber bound, <lb/>
            When Cupid came and snatched me from my bed, <lb/>
            And forc'd me many a weary way to tread. <lb/>
            " What!" said the god, " shall you, whose vows are <lb/>

            Yes, at that hour, when Nature seems interred, <lb/>

            he says, his heart flew to his nose; but our manner <lb/>
            more naturally transfers it to the lips. Such is the <lb/>
            effect that Plato tells us he felt from a kiss, in a <lb/>
            distich, quoted by Aulus Gellius:</p><figure type="illustration">

          <p>CUPID once upon a bed <lb/>
            Of roses laid his weary head; <lb/>
            Luckless urchin, not to see <lb/>
            Within the leaves a slumbering bee!</p>
          <p>Theocritus has imitated this beautiful ode in his <lb/>
            nineteenth idyll, but is very inferior, I think, to his <lb/>
            original, in delicacy of point and naivete of expres- <lb/>
            sion. Spencer, in one of his smaller compositions, <lb/>
            has sported more diffusely on the same subject. <lb/>
            The poem to which I allude, begins thus:</p>
          <p>Upon a day, as Love lay sweetly slumbering <lb/>
            All in his mothers lap; <lb/>
            A gentle bee, with his loud trumpet murmuring, <lb/>
            About him flew by hap, &amp;c &amp;c.</p>
          <p>In Almeloveen's collection of epigrams, there is <lb/>
            one by Luxorius, correspondent somewhat with the <lb/>
            turn of Anacreon, where Love complains to his <lb/>
            mother of being wounded by a rose.</p>
          <p>The ode before us is the very flower of simplicity. <lb/>
            The infantine complainings of the little god, and</p><pb n="162"/>
            
          <p>The bee awak'd—with anger wild <lb/>
            The bee awak'd, and stung the child.</p>
          <p>the natural and impressive reflection which they <lb/>
            draw from Venus, are beauties of inimitable grace. <lb/>
            I hope I shall be pardoned for introducing another <lb/>
            Greek Anacreontic of Monsieur Menage, not for <lb/>
            its similitude to the subject of this ode, but for <lb/>
            some faint traces of this natural simplicity, which <lb/>
            it appears to me to have preserved:</p><figure type="illustration">

            " I die with pain-in sooth I do!</p>

            My soul's Corinna lightly played, <lb/>

            He saw, and in a moment flew, <lb/>
            And round her neck his arms he threw; <lb/>
            And said, with smiles of infant joy, <lb/>
            " Oh! kiss me, mother, kiss thy boy!" <lb/>
            Unconscious of a mothers name, <lb/>
            The modest virgin blush'd with shame! <lb/>

            the moralist. Among many parallel passages which <lb/>

            And through the dance meandering glide; <lb/>
            Let me imbibe the spicy breath <lb/>
            Of odours chafed to fragrant death; <lb/>
            Or from the kiss of love inhale <lb/>
            A more voluptuous, richer gale!</p><figure type="illustration">

          <p>Of which the following is a loose paraphrase:</p>
          <p>Fly, my beloved? to yonder stream, <lb/>
            We'll plunge us from the noontide beam; <lb/>
            Then cull the rose's humid bud, <lb/>
            And dip it in our goblet's flood. <lb/>
            Our age of bliss, my nymph, shall fly, <lb/>

            " Come, while you may of rapture sip." <lb/>
            For age will steal the rosy form, <lb/>

            Like yours and mine, should e'er be still!</p><pb n="174"/>

          <p>SEE the young, the rosy Spring, <lb/>
            Gives to the breeze her spangled wing; <lb/>
            While virgin Graces, warm with May, <lb/>

          <p>The fastidious affectation of some commentators <lb/>
            has denounced this ode as spurious. Degen pro- <lb/>
            nounces the four last lines to be the patch-work of <lb/>
            some miserable versificator, and Brunck condemns <lb/>
            the whole ode. It appears to me to be elegantly <lb/>
            graphical; full of delicate expressions and luxuriant <lb/>
            imagery. The abruptness of '<foreign xml:lang="grc">Ιδε ω̃ως εαρος ϕανεντος</foreign> is <lb/>
            striking and spirited, and has been imitated rather <lb/>
            languidly by Horace; <lb/>
            Vides ut alta stet nive candidum <lb/>
            Soracte</p>
          <p>The imperative <foreign xml:lang="grc">ιδε</foreign> is infinitely more impressive, <lb/>

            But look, the morn, in russet mantle clad, <lb/>
            Walks o'er the dew of yon high eastern hill.</p>
          <p>There is a simple and poetical description of <lb/>
            Spring, in Catullus's beautiful farewel to Bithynia. <lb/>

            Their plumes in the reflecting wave;</p>
          <p>Barnes conjectures, in his life of our poet, that this <lb/>
            ode was written after he had returned from Athens, <lb/>
            to settle in his paternal seat at Teos; there, in a <lb/>
            little villa at some distance from the city, which <lb/>
            commanded a view of the Ægean Sea and the <lb/>
            islands, he contemplated the beauties of nature and <lb/>
            enjoyed the felicities of retirement. Vide Barnes, <lb/>
            in Anac. vita, § xxxv. This supposition, however <lb/>
            unauthenticated, forms a pleasant association, which <lb/>
            makes the poem more interesting.</p>
          <p>Monsieur Chevreau says, that Gregory Nazian- <lb/>
            zenus has paraphrased somewhere this description <lb/>
            of Spring; I cannot find it. See Chevreau CEuvres <lb/>
            Melees.</p>
          <p>" Compare with this ode (says Degen) the verses <lb/>
            of Hagedorn, book fourth der Frühling, and book <lb/>
            fifth der Mai."</p>

          <p>WHILE we invoke the wreathed spring, <lb/>

            Resplendent rose, the flower of flowers, <lb/>
            Whose breath perfumes Olympus, bowers;</p>
          <p>This ode is a brilliant panegyric on the rose. " All <lb/>
            antiquity (says Barnes) has produced nothing more <lb/>
            beautiful."</p>
          <p>From the idea of peculiar excellence, which the <lb/>
            ancients attached to this flower, arose a pretty pro- <lb/>
            verbial expression, used by Aristophanes, according <lb/>
            to Suidas, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ςοδα</foreign> " You have spoken roses," <lb/>
            a phrase somewhat similar to the " dire des fleu- <lb/>
            rettes" of the French. In the same idea of excellence <lb/>
            originated, I doubt not, a very curious application of <lb/>
            the word <foreign xml:lang="grc">ςοδο</foreign>v, for which the inquisitive reader may <lb/>
            consult Gaulminus upon the epithalamium of our <lb/>
            poet, where it is introduced in the romance of Theo- <lb/>
            dorus. Muretus, in one of his elegies, calls his <lb/>
            mistress his rose:</p>
          <p>Jam te igitur rursus teneo, formosula, jam te <lb/>
            (Quid trepidas?) teneo; jam, rosa, te teneo. <lb/>

          <p>Whose virgin blush, of chastened dye, <lb/>
            Enchants so much our mortal eye. <lb/>
            When pleasure's bloomy season glows, <lb/>
            The Graces love to twine the rose;</p>
          <p>Now I again embrace thee, dearest, <lb/>
            (Tell me, wanton, why thou fearest?) <lb/>
            Again my longing arms infold thee, <lb/>
            Again, my rose, again I hold thee.</p>
          <p>This, like most of the terms of endearment in <lb/>
            the modern Latin poets, is taken from Plautus; they <lb/>
            were vulgar and colloquial in his time, and they are <lb/>
            among the elegancies of the modern Latinists.</p>
          <p>Passeratius alludes to the ode before us, in the <lb/>
            beginning of his poem on the Rose:</p>
          <p>Carmina digna rosa est; vellem caneretur ut illam <lb/>
            Teius argutâ cecinit testudine vates.</p>

            in this original reading, and has been very little im- <lb/>

            occurs afterwards: <foreign xml:lang="grc">θερεδη ϕνσιν λεγωμεν</foreign>.</p><pb n="218"/>

            Oft has the poet's magic tongue <lb/>

          <p>Where " veris honor," though it mean every kind <lb/>
            of flowers, may seem more particularly to refer to <lb/>
            the rose, which our poet in another ode calls <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐχρος <lb/>

            their wills, that roses should be annually scattered <lb/>

            that this flower prevails over time itself, he still <lb/>
            alludes to its efficacy in embalment (tenera poneret <lb/>
            ossa rosa. Propert. lib. i. eleg. 17), or perhaps to <lb/>
            the subsequent idea of its fragrance surviving its <lb/>
            beauty; for he can scarcely mean to praise for du- <lb/>
            ration the , nimium breves flores" of the rose. Phi- <lb/>
            lostratus compares this flower with love, and says, <lb/>

          <p>AND whose immortal hand could shed <lb/>
            Upon this disk the ocean's bed?</p>
          <p>This ode is a very animated description of a pic- <lb/>
            ture of Venus on a discus, which represented the <lb/>
            goddess in her first emergence from the waves. <lb/>
            About two centuries after our poet wrote, the pencil <lb/>
            of the artist Apelles embellished this subject, in his <lb/>
            famous painting of the Venus Anadyomene, the <lb/>
            model of which, as Pliny informs us, was the beau- <lb/>
            tiful Campaspe, given to him by Alexander; though, <lb/>
            according to Natalis Comes, lib. vii. cap. 16, it was <lb/>
            Phryne who sat to Apelles for the face and breast <lb/>
            of this Venus.</p>
          <p>There are a few blemishes in the reading of the <lb/>
            ode before us, which have influenced Faber, Heyne, <lb/>
            Brunck, &amp;c. to denounce the whole poem as spurious. <lb/>
            Non ego paucis offendar maculis. I think it is <lb/>
            beautiful enough to be authentic.</p>
          <p>And whose immortal hand could shed <lb/>

            <foreign xml:lang="grc">αρα τις τοςενσε</foreign> w<foreign xml:lang="grc">οντον</foreign>, is finely expressive of sudden <lb/>
            admiration, and is one of those beauties, which we <lb/>
            cannot but admire in their source, though, by fre- <lb/>
            quent imitation, they are now become languid and <lb/>
            unimpressive.</p><pb n="229"/>
            
          <p>And, in a frenzied flight of soul <lb/>
            Sublime as heaven's eternal pole, <lb/>
            Imagine thus, in semblance warm, <lb/>
            The Queen of Lovers voluptuous form <lb/>
            Floating along the silvery sea <lb/>
            In beauty's naked majesty! <lb/>
            Oh! he has given the captured sight <lb/>
            A witching banquet of delight; <lb/>
            And all those sacred scenes of love, <lb/>
            Where only hallowed eyes may rove, <lb/>
            Lie faintly glowing, half-concealed, <lb/>
            Within the lucid billows veiled. <lb/>
            Light as the leaf, that summers breeze <lb/>
            Has wafted o'er the glassy seas,</p>
          <p>And all those sacred scenes of love, <lb/>
            Where only hallow'd eyes may rove, &amp;c.] The <lb/>
            picture here has all the delicate character of the <lb/>
            semi-reducta Venus, and is the sweetest emblem of <lb/>
            what the poetry of passion ought to be; glowing but <lb/>
            through a viel, and stealing upon the heart from <lb/>
            concealment. Few of the ancients have attained <lb/>
            this modesty of description, which is like the golden <lb/>
            cloud that hung over Jupiter and Juno, impervious <lb/>
            to every beam but that of fancy.</p><pb n="230"/>
            
          <p>She floats upon the ocean's breast, <lb/>
            Which undulates in sleepy rest, <lb/>
            And stealing on, she gently pillows <lb/>
            Her bosom on the amorous billows. <lb/>
            Her bosom, like the humid rose, <lb/>
            Her neck, like dewy-sparkling snows, <lb/>
            Illume the liquid path she traces, <lb/>
            And burn within the stream's embraces! <lb/>
            In languid luxury soft she glides, <lb/>

            Swears that the herbage heaven had spread, <lb/>

            some to doubt whether he ever wrote any odes of <lb/>
            this kind. It is related by the Scholiast upon Pindar <lb/>
            (Isthmionic. od. ii. v. 1. as cited by Barnes). Ana- <lb/>
            creon being asked, why he addressed all his hymns <lb/>
            to women, and none to the deities? answered, <lb/>
            " Because women are my dieties."</p>
          <p>I have assumed the same liberty in reporting this <lb/>
            anecdote, which I have done in translating some of <lb/>
            the odes; and it were to be wished that these little <lb/>
            infidelities were always considered pardonable in the <lb/>
            interpretation of the ancients; thus, when nature is <lb/>

          <p>Among the Epigrams of the Anthology <lb/>
            there are some panegyrics on Anacreon, which <lb/>
            I had translated, and originally intended as a <lb/>
            kind of Coronis to the work; but I found, upon <lb/>
            consideration, that they wanted variety; a fre- <lb/>
            quent recurrence of the same thought, within <lb/>
            the limits of an epitaph, to which they are con- <lb/>
            fined, would render a collection of them rather <lb/>
            uninteresting. I shall take the liberty, however, <lb/>
            of subjoining a few, that I may not appear to <lb/>
            have totally neglected those elegant tributes to <lb/>
            the reputation of Anacreon. The four epi- <lb/>
            grams which I give are imputed to Antipater <lb/>
            Sidonius. They are rendered, perhaps, with <lb/>
            too much freedom; but designing a translation <lb/>
            of all that are on the subject, I imagined it was <lb/>
            necessary to enliven their uniformity by some- <lb/>
            times indulging in the liberties of paraphrase.</p><pb n="285"/>

            Long may the deathless ivy twine, <lb/>
            And Summer pour her waste of roses!</p>
          <p>Antipater Sidonius, the author of this epigram, <lb/>
            lived, according to Vossius, de Poetis Græcis, in the <lb/>
            second year of the 169th Olympiad. He appears, <lb/>
            from what Cicero and Quintilian have said of him, <lb/>
            to have been a kind of improvvisatore. See Institut. <lb/>
            Orat. lib. x. cap. 7. There is nothing more known <lb/>

          <p>And many a fount shall there distil, <lb/>
            And many a rill refresh the flowers; <lb/>
            But wine shall gush in every rill, <lb/>
            And every fount be milky showers.</p>
          <p>Thus, shade of him, whom Nature taught <lb/>
            To tune his lyre and soul to pleasure, <lb/>
            Who gave to love his warmest thought, <lb/>
            Who gave to love his fondest measure!</p>
          <p>his illness and death, which are mentioned as curious <lb/>
            by Pliny and others; and there remain of his works <lb/>
            but a few epigrams in the Anthologia, among which <lb/>
            are these I have selected, upon Anacreon. Those <lb/>
            remains have been sometimes imputed to another <lb/>
            poet* of the same name, of whom Vossius gives us <lb/>
            the following account: " Antipater Thessalonicensis <lb/>
            vixit tempore August! Cæsaris, ut qui saltantem <lb/>
            viderit Pyladem, sicut constat ex quodam ejus epi- <lb/>

            that the poet Antipater was one of the first panto- <lb/>
            mime dancers in Rome.</p>
          <p>Barnes, upon the epigram before us, mentions a <lb/>
            version of it by Brodæus, which is not to be found in <lb/>
            that commentator; but he more than once confounds <lb/>
            Brodaeus, with another annotator on the Anthologia, <lb/>
            Vincentius Obsopœus, who has given a translation of <lb/>
            the epigram.</p><pb n="288"/>

          <p>HERE sleeps Anacreon, in this ivied shade; <lb/>
            Here mute in death the Teian swan is laid. <lb/>

            All the voluptuous frenzy of desire!</p>
          <p>tile Teian swan is laid. ] Thus Horace of <lb/>
            Pindar :</p>
          <p>Multa Dircxum levat aura cycnum.</p>
          <p>A swan was the hieroglyphical emblem of a poet. <lb/>
            Anacreon has been called the swan of Téos by <lb/>
            another of his eulogists.</p><pb n="289"/>

            The Teian, nurs'd with all those honied boys, <lb/>
            The young Desires, light Loves, and rose-lip'd Joys !</p>
          <p>Still, still we catch thy lyre's delicious breath ;] Thus <lb/>
            Simonides, speaking of our poet: <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_RANDOM_06_fig68.jpg"/></figure> <lb/>
              Nor yet are all his numbers mute, <lb/>
              Though dark within the tomb he lies; <lb/>
              But living still, his amorous lute <lb/>
              With sleepless animation sighs!</p><pb n="290"/>
              
          <p>Nor yet has death obscured thy fire of love, <lb/>
            Still, still it lights thee through the Elysian <lb/>
            grove; <lb/>
            And dreams are thine, that bless th'elect <lb/>
            alone, <lb/>
            And Venus calls thee e'en in death her own!</p>
          <p>This is the famous Simonides, whom Plato styled <lb/>
            " divine;" though Le Fevre, in his Poetes Grecs, <lb/>
            supposes that the epigrams under his name are <lb/>
            all falsely imputed. The most considerable of his <lb/>
            remains is a satirical poem upon women, preserved <lb/>
            by Stobasus, <foreign xml:lang="grc">Ψογ γυναιϰων</foreign>.</p>
          <p>We may judge from the lines I have just quoted, <lb/>
            and the import of the epigram before us, that the <lb/>
            works of Anacreon were perfect in the times of <lb/>
            Simonides and Antipater. Obsopceus, the commen- <lb/>
            tator here, appears to exult in their destruction; and <lb/>
            telling us they were burned by the bishops and <lb/>
            patriarchs, he adds, " nec sane id necquicquam fece- <lb/>
            runt," attributing to this outrage an effect which it <lb/>
            could never produce.</p><pb n="291"/>

          <p>On! stranger, if Anacreon's shell <lb/>
            Has ever taught thy heart to swell <lb/>
            With passions throb or pleasure's sigh, <lb/>
            In pity turn, as wandering nigh,</p>
          <p>The spirit of Anacreon utters these verses from <lb/>
            the tomb, somewhat " mutatus ab illo," at least in <lb/>
            simplicity of expression.</p>
          <p>if Anacreon's shell <lb/>
            Has ever taught thy heart to swell, &amp;c.] We may <lb/>
            guess from the words <foreign xml:lang="grc">εϰ βιλων εμων</foreign>, that Anacreon <lb/>
            was not merely a writer of billets-doux, as some <lb/>
            French critics have called him. Amongst these Mr.</p><pb n="292"/>

            In exquisite libation here ! <lb/>
            So shall my sleeping ashes thrill <lb/>
            With visions of enjoyment still.</p>
          <p>Le Fevre, with all his professed admiration, has given <lb/>
            our poet a character by no means of an elevated <lb/>
            cast:</p>
          <p>Aussi c'est pour cela que la posterite <lb/>
            L'a toujours justement d'age en age chanté <lb/>
            Comme un franc gogue-nard, ami de goin-frerie, <lb/>
            Ami de billets-doux et de badinerie.</p>
          <p>See the verses prefixed to his Poetes Grecs. This <lb/>
            is unlike the language of Theocritus, to whom <lb/>
            Anacreon is indebted for the following simple eulo- <lb/>
            glum:</p><figure type="illustration">

          <p>I cannot e'en in death resign <lb/>
            The festal joys that once were mine, <lb/>
            When Harmony pursued my ways, <lb/>
            And Bacchus wanton'd to my lays..</p>
          <p>Upon the Statue of Anacreon.</p>
          <p>Stranger! who near this statue chance to roam, <lb/>
            Let it awhile your studious eyes engage; <lb/>
            And you may say, returning to your home, <lb/>
            " I've seen the image of the Teian sage, <lb/>
            " Best of the bards who deck the Muse's page." <lb/>
            Then, if you add " that striplings lov'd him well," <lb/>
            You tell them all he was, and aptly tell.</p>
          <p>The simplicity of this inscription has always delighted <lb/>
