            <title type="main">BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.</title>
          </head>
          <p>THE author of the celebrated romance of " THE GOLDEN Ass" <lb/>
            lived in the early part of the second century, under the Antonines. <lb/>
            By most modern biographers he is called Lucius Apuleius, or <lb/>
            Appuleius, but the authority on which they assign him that præ­ <lb/>
            nomen is very questionable. He was a native of Madaura, an <lb/>
            inland African town, and he styles himself, in allusion to its po­ <lb/>
            sition on the borders of two kingdoms, " a half-and-half Numi- <lb/>
            than and Getulian;" adding that, in that respect, he resembled <lb/>
            the elder Cyrus, who was " a Semi-Median and Semi.Persian." <lb/>
            Madaura, after having formed part of the kingdom of Syphax. <lb/>
            was bestowed by the Romans on their ally Masinissa, and being <lb/>
            eventually resumed and peopled by veterans, it obtained the <lb/>
            rank and immunities of a " colony," and rose to considerable <lb/>
            splendour. The father of Apuleius filled the office of duumvir, <lb/>
            the highest magisterial dignity in his native place, and bequeathed <lb/>
            at his death the sum of nearly two millions of sesterces to his <lb/>
            two sons, one of whom, the subject of our present inquiries, <lb/>
            succeeded to his office. These facts we learn from the direct <lb/>
            testimony of the son in his Apologia or Defence ; but most of <lb/>
            the biographers of Apuleius add other particulars, drawn from <lb/>
            the assumption that, under the character of Lucius, the imagi­ <lb/>
            nary hero of the story of "the Golden Ass," the author <lb/>
            has related sundry details of his own personal history. Upon <lb/>
            this supposition, we are told that our author's prænomen was <lb/>
            Lucius, that his father's name was Theseus, his mother's Salvia, <lb/>
            and that she was of a Thessalian family, and descended from the <lb/>
            illustrious Plutarch; furthermore, that Apuleius was ignorant of <lb/>
            the Latin language until he visited Rome. where he acquired it <note type="footnote"> a 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="-"/>
            without the aid of a master; and that by the time he arrived at <lb/>
            the capital of the empire, he had so completely dissipated his <lb/>
            patrimony, as to be under the necessity of selling his clothes, in <lb/>
            order to defray the cost of his initiation into the mysteries of <lb/>
            Osiris. This latter statement is at variance with the account <lb/>
            which he gives of his fortune in the Apologia, where he says, <lb/>
            merely, that it had been, " modice imminutum," somewhat im. <lb/>
            paired; the other particulars may or may not be true. There <lb/>
            is, no doubt, such a 'resemblance between Apuleius and Lucius, <lb/>
            both as regards mental characteristics and outward incidents, that <lb/>
            we can hardly suppose it to be fortuitous. It is highly probable <lb/>
            that the author drew his hero from his own likeness; but on the <lb/>
            other hand, it is absurd to look for literal fidelity in such a por­ <lb/>
            trait. It is not likely, for instance, that Apuleius would have <lb/>
            deemed it consistent with decorum to speak of himself, his father <lb/>
            and his mother, by their real names, in so frolicsome a work of fiction <lb/>
            as " The Golden Ass," since we find, that when addressing the sons <lb/>
            of a friend in some complimentary verses of a peculiar character, <lb/>
            such as the habits of his day allowed, he thought it his duty to <lb/>
            invent pseudonymes for the objects of his flattery.*</p>
          <p>Apuleius received the first rudiments of education at Carthage, <lb/>
            renowned at that time as a school of literature, and there he <lb/>
            adopted the Platonic system of philosophy, in which he perfected <lb/>
            himself by his subsequent studies at Athens. There, too, he <lb/>
            laid the foundations of that copious stock of various and profound <lb/>
            learning, through which he became the most distinguished lite­ <lb/>
            rary character of his age. Still thirsting for knowledge, and <lb/>
            impelled, like his own Lucius, by an insatiable curiosity to ex­ <lb/>
            plore all that was hidden from the vulgar gaze, he travelled <lb/>
            through Greece, Asia, and Italy, and became a member of <lb/>
            many religious fraternities, and a proficient in their mys­ <lb/>
            teries. After his return to Africa, he was about to renew his <lb/>
            travels, and on his way to Alexandria was taken ill at Oëa, a <lb/>
            maritime town, which some geographers have identified with <lb/>
            the modern Tripoli. A young man, named Pontianus, whom <note type="footnote"> * See Defence, p. 256. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="V"/>
            he had known as a fellow-student at Athens, invited the invalid <lb/>
            to become the guest of his mother, a wealthy widow, named <lb/>
            Pudentilla. In making this hospitable proposal, Pontianus <lb/>
            had more in view than the comfort of his friend, and the <lb/>
            restoration of his health. Pudentilla was herself also an invalid, <lb/>
            being affected with a chronic complaint, which had lasted thir­ <lb/>
            teen years-the duration of her widowhood-and for which her <lb/>
            medical advisers all agreed in prescribing marriage as a remedy. <lb/>
            The son, seeing his mother prepared to try the effect of that <lb/>
            nostrum, was desirous that her new husband should be one of <lb/>
            his own choosing. Accordingly, he begged Apuleius would do <lb/>
            him the favour to become his stepfather, putting the affair to <lb/>
            him, says the latter, in the light of an onerous service, such as <lb/>
            one might ask a friend and a philosopher to undertake. The <lb/>
            widow was neither young nor handsome, but she was virtuous, <lb/>
            fond, and very rich. Apuleius, if not poor, was, at least, reduced <lb/>
            in circumstances, in consequence of his long-continued course of <lb/>
            study, his protracted residence in foreign countries, and various <lb/>
            acts of generosity towards his friends and instructors ; moreover, <lb/>
            he was a philosopher; so in fine he married the widow.</p>
          <p>But this act involved some unpleasant consequences. Before <lb/>
            it was accomplished, Pontianus had married the daughter of <lb/>
            one Rufinus, who, long eager to secure to his son-in-law as <lb/>
            large a share as possible in the fortune of Pudentilla, did <lb/>
            all he could to prevent her marriage with Apuleius; and in <lb/>
            this he was seconded by Pontianus, over whom he had acquired <lb/>
            such an influence, as to make him look with aversion on the suc­ <lb/>
            cess of his own project. But not with standing all opposition, <lb/>
            Pudentilla persisted in her resolution ; and soon after her mar­ <lb/>
            riage, Pontianus died. His uncle, AEmilianus, then united with <lb/>
            Rufinus in endeavours to ruin Apuleius. They gave out that he <lb/>
            had poisoned Pontianus, that he was a magician, and had gained <lb/>
            the affections of Pudentilla by witcheraft. They even prosecuted <lb/>
            him upon the latter charge, and the cause was tried at Sabrata, <lb/>
            before Claudius Maximus, the proconsul of Africa. It was on <lb/>
            that occasion he delivered the Defence, a translation of which <lb/>
             <pb n="VI"/>
            will be found in this volume. It is a clever and amusing per <lb/>
            formance, having nothing of the tragic earnestness of a man who <lb/>
            is pleading for his life; on the-contrary, Apuleius appears, from <lb/>
            first to last, to have felt quite secure as to the issue, and to have <lb/>
            flung himself with great glee into a contest which afforded him <lb/>
            such capital opportunities for displaying his wit, his learning, and <lb/>
            his powers of rhetoric. His adversaries had a bad game to play; <lb/>
            they played it into his hands, and he made good use of their blun­ <lb/>
            ders. The main charge was ridiculous enough, and Apuleius had for <lb/>
            it a ready and sufficient answer : " You are surprised," he said, <lb/>
            " that a woman should have married again after thirteen years of <lb/>
            widowhood; but the real wonder is, that she should have remained <lb/>
            unmarried so long. You pretend that magic alone could have <lb/>
            forced a widow of her years to marry a young man ; but that is <lb/>
            just the sort of case in which magic would be quite superfluous." <lb/>
            As if to give the more force to this argument, the prosecutors <lb/>
            were indiscreet enough to lay great stress on the graces and ac­ <lb/>
            complishments of the accused, and to press upon the notice of <lb/>
            the court that Apuleius was altogether such a man as was most <lb/>
            likely, in the natural course of things, to find favour in a woman's <lb/>
            eyes; for he was handsome, and not negligent of his person ; he <lb/>
            used a mirror ; he combed his hair ; he actually cleaned his teeth ! <lb/>
            and this handsome man, who cultivated cleanliness as well as phi­ <lb/>
            losophy, had a ready wit and a fluent tongue!</p>
          <p>After the discomfiture of his wife's relations, it seems probable <lb/>
            that nothing very remarkable occurred to disturb the even tenour <lb/>
            of a life of literary labour to which Apuleius devoted himself. <lb/>
            All that is known of this latter part of his career, is, that he was <lb/>
            a most voluminous writer; that he frequently declaimed in public <lb/>
            with great applause; he was a priest of Æsculapius, the pa­ <lb/>
            tron god of Carthage; he had the charge of exhibiting gladi­ <lb/>
            atorial shows and wild beast hunts in the province, and statues <lb/>
            were erected in his honour by the senate of Carthage and of other <lb/>
            states. It was probably in his latter days that he composed his <lb/>
            most celebrated work, " The Metamorphoses, or the Golden Ass <lb/>
            for neither does he allude to it in those passages in which he boasts <lb/>
             <pb n="VII"/>
            of the extent and variety of his literary productions ; nor was any <lb/>
            mention made of it upon the occasion of his trial for magic, as <lb/>
            would certainly have been done had his prosecutors been aware <lb/>
            of the existence of such a book. This celebrated romance pur­ <lb/>
            ports to be the autobiography of a certain Lucius of Madaura, <lb/>
            whose curiosity with respect to magic. has been rewarded by his <lb/>
            tranformation into the form of a jackass, in which he undergoes <lb/>
            many curious and ludicrous adventures, until he is at last restored <lb/>
            to human shape by the interposition of the goddess Isis, to whose <lb/>
            service he devotes himself. Had this amusing story appeared <lb/>
            before the trial at Sabrata, it might have been used with formid­ <lb/>
            able effect against its author, whose contemporaries, anticipat­ <lb/>
            ing the opinions of a subsequent age, might have identified <lb/>
            Lucius with Apuleius, and believed the latter to be a great <lb/>
            magician.</p>
          <p>Lactantius informs us that the early pagan controversialists <lb/>
            used to rank Apuleius with Apollonius of Tyana, as a thauma- <lb/>
            turgus, and to cite various miracles performed by him as equal, or <lb/>
            superior to those of Christ. A generation later, St. Augustine <lb/>
            permitted himself to doubt whether the account given by Lucius, <lb/>
            or Apuleius, of his change into an ass was not a true relation <lb/>
            " Aut indicavit," says he, " aut finxit."</p>
          <p>The Golden Ass, in which many writers, especially Bishop War­ <lb/>
            burton, have been at pains to discover a profound theological <lb/>
            purpose, appears to have been written with a view to little else <lb/>
            than the amusement of a profane public. It is enriched with <lb/>
            numerous episodes, of which the best known, and by far the most <lb/>
            beautiful, is the story of Cupid and Psyche. Another forms the <lb/>
            second story of the seventh day of the Decameron. An adventure <lb/>
            which befel Lucius, probably suggested to Cervantes the dreadful <lb/>
            combat which took place at an inn between Don Quixote and the <lb/>
            Wine-skins; and there is a striking resemblance between the occur- <lb/>
            fences seen by Lucius at the habitation of robbers, and some of the <lb/>
            early incidents in Gil Bias. Apuleius, who is now comparatively <lb/>
            neglected, was familiarly known to all readers of the classics <lb/>
            during the three centuries preceding our own; but it is only <lb/>
             <pb n="VIII"/>
            through the medium of a translation that Englishmen, at least, <lb/>
            are likely to make much acquaintance with him for the future. <lb/>
            His Latin is very troublesome to read, and it is not worth reading <lb/>
            for its own sake. He is a most amusing writer, with an execrable <lb/>
            style, and therefore he is one of the few who ought to gain rather <lb/>
            than lose by translation. "No one," says Professor Ramsay, <lb/>
            " can peruse a few pages of Apuleius without being at once im­ <lb/>
            pressed with his conspicuous excellencies and his glaring defects. <lb/>
            We find everywhere an exuberant pl ay of fancy, liveliness, humour, <lb/>
            wit, learning, acuteness, and not unfrequently real eloquence. On <lb/>
            the other hand, no style can be more vicious. It is in the high­ <lb/>
            est degree unnatural, both in its general tone and in the phrase­ <lb/>
            ology employed. The former is disfigured by the constant recur­ <lb/>
            rence of ingenious but forced and learned conceits and studied <lb/>
            prettinesses, while the latter is remarkable for the multitude of <lb/>
            obsolete words ostentatiously paraded in almost every sentence. <lb/>
            The greater number of these are to be found in the extant com­ <lb/>
            positions of the oldest dramatic writers, and in quotations pre­ <lb/>
            served by the grammarians ; and those for which no authority can <lb/>
            be produced, were, in all probability, drawn from the same source, <lb/>
            and not arbitrarily coined to answer the purpose of the moment, <lb/>
            as some critics have imagined. The least faulty perhaps, of all, <lb/>
            is the Apologia. Here he spoke from deep feeling; and although <lb/>
            we may in many places detect the inveterate affectation of the rhe­ <lb/>
            torician, yet there is often a bold, manly, straightforward hearti­ <lb/>
            ness and truth, which we seek in vain in those compositions where <lb/>
            his feelings were less couched."</p>
          <p>Of all the voluminous writings of Apuleius there are only six <lb/>
            extant of unquestioned authenticity. Two we have already named; <lb/>
            the third is a dissertation on the God of Socrates, a work which <lb/>
            has been roughly attacked by St. Augustine; the fourth a treatise <lb/>
            on the Doctrines of Plato; the fifth the book entitled Florida, <lb/>
            which is commonly supposed to be an anthology from the orations <lb/>
            of Apuleius, collected either by himself or one of his admirers, <lb/>
            but more probably a collection of passages intended as proemia <lb/>
            to sundry declamations, or to be introduced, as occasion might <lb/>
             <pb n="IX"/>
            serve, intp the body of an extemporaneous harangue. The sixth <lb/>
            and last is the De Mundo Liber, a translation of an anonymous <lb/>
            Greek treatise, erroneously ascribed to Aristotle, which we have <lb/>
            not thought worth inserting. The treatise on Plato is not in­ <lb/>
            cluded here, as it has already been given in the sixth volume of <lb/>

          <p>The Golden Ass has been several times presented to the English <lb/>
            public, but, it is believed, never yet so completely or faithfully. The <lb/>
            God of Socrates has once previously been translated, (by Thomas <lb/>
            Taylor), but the Florida, and the Apologia or Defence, are now <lb/>
            given in English for the first time. The able metrical version of <lb/>
            Cupid and Psyche, first published in 1801 anonymously, but at­ <lb/>
            tributed to the pen of Hudson Gurney, Esq., and the well-known <lb/>
            poem of Psyche by Mrs. Tighe, are adjoined, because of their <lb/>
            appropriateness and merit. The latter was highly popular at the <lb/>
            time of its first publication, went through several large editions, <lb/>
            and was elaborately reviewed and praised in the Quarterly Review <lb/>
            of May, 1811. <note type="footnote"> &amp; </note> <pb n="-"/>

          <p>IN the following Milesian t narrative, I will string together <lb/>
            various stories, and regale your listening ears with some merry <lb/>
            whispers, if only you will not disdain to look upon this Egyp­ <lb/>
            tian papyrus, written with the subtle point of a Nilotic <lb/>
            reed; and I will proceed to astonish you with the adventures <lb/>
            of men changed into different shapes, and, after various vicis­ <lb/>
            situdes, restored to their original forms. Who I am, I will <lb/>
            tell you in a few words:</p>

            Sparta, famous lands, immortalized in books still more famous, <note type="footnote"> * Golden. ]-The following remarks relative to this epithet are from Dr. <lb/>
            Smith's ' Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography —"The epithet <lb/>
            ' aureus' is generally supposed to have been bestowed in consequence of the <lb/>
            admiration in which this tale was held, for, being considered as the most <lb/>
            excellent composition of its kind, it was compared to tie most excellent <lb/>
            of metals. Warburton, however, ingeniously contends that ' aureus' was <lb/>
            the common.epithet bestowed upon all Milesian tales, because they were <lb/>
            such as strollers used to rehearse for a piece of money to the rabble in a <lb/>
            circle, after the fashion of oriental story-tellers. He founds his conjec­ <lb/>
            ture upon an expression in one of Pliny's Epistles ( ii. 20), ' Assem para,- <lb/>
            et. accipe auream fabulam,'—' give me a piece of copper, and receive in <lb/>
            return a story worth a piece of gold,' or, ' precious as gold,' which brings <lb/>
            us back to the old explanation." </note><note type="footnote"> t Milesian.]- The people of Miletus were famed for their love of merri. <lb/>

            are my old nurseries.* There, in the early studies of my youth, <lb/>
            I learned the Attic tongue. Soon after, a stranger in the <lb/>
            Latian city, I applied myself to the study of the native lan­ <lb/>
            guage of the Romans; which I acquired with painful labour, <lb/>
            without the help of a master.</p>
          <p>Behold, then, I preface with asking pardon, should I in any <lb/>
            way offend by my unskilful use of a strange and foreign tongue. <lb/>
            Indeed this very change of language well befits the description <lb/>
            of the transformatory art of magic, of which we purpose here <lb/>
            to treat. We will begin, then, a Grecian story :f Reader, <lb/>
            attend, you will be delighted. <note type="footnote"> * My old nurseries.]-' Mea vetus prosapia est.' Taylor, following <lb/>
            the Delphin interpretation, takes this to mean : ' are the ancient originals <lb/>
            of my race.' This version is either expressly warranted or tacitly ad. <lb/>
            mitted by all the commentators ; but, however respectable the authorities <lb/>
            in its favour, it wants that of common sense. If Lucius, who was a <lb/>
            native of Medaura, in Africa, had intended to tell us where his progenitors <lb/>
            had lived, why should he have omitted Thessaly, the country of his <lb/>
            mother's ancestors ? It is just possible that his father might have traced <lb/>
            back his pedigree, through a pair inhabiting one of the places named, <lb/>
            to a male and female ancestor belonging severally to the other two ; but <lb/>
            would it have followed thence that Lucius should have pursued his early <lb/>
            studies in those very three places ? What he desires to make known to <lb/>
            the reader is, that Greek was the language of his youth, and Latin a <lb/>
            later acquirement, a fact upon which the nationality of two of his remote <lb/>
            ancestors could have no bearing whatever. We incline to think that the <lb/>
            word ' prosapia,' which literally means, lineage, is here used in a figurative <lb/>
            sense, akin to that in which Englishmen speak of their university as their <lb/>
            ' alma mater.' Unfortunately we cannot decide the question by references <lb/>
            to other authors; for prosapia, as we learn from Quintilian, is one of <lb/>
            those antiquated and obsolete words to the use of which Apuleius and his <lb/>
            contemporary Aulus Gellius were inordinately addicted. At all events, <lb/>
            ' original seat of a race,' is quite as arbitrary a rendering of ' prosapia <lb/>
            as that which we have ventured to assign to it.-K. </note><note type="footnote"> t A Grecian story. ]-This name is probably given to the story, from the <lb/>
            scene being laid in Thessaly. It is also not improbable that he calls the <lb/>
            work by this epithet in consequence of having derived it from Lucius of <lb/>
            Patræ, a Grecian writer, from whom. also, Lucian derived his work, which <lb/>
            is somewhat similar, called <foreign xml:lang="grc">ονος</foreign>, ' the ass.' </note> <pb n="3"/>

          <p>I HAD occasion to visit Thessaly on business; for it was there <lb/>
            that our origin on the maternal side was derived, in the first <lb/>
            place, from the celebrated Plutarch,* and afterwards from his <lb/>
            grandson, Sextus, the philosopher, a thing which reflects so <lb/>
            much honour upon us. I had travelled over lofty mountains, <lb/>
            slippery valleys, dewy turf, and thick-clodded plains, being <lb/>
            mounted on a milk-white horse of that country; and as he <lb/>
            was now much fatigued, I jumped upon ray feet, in order that <lb/>
            I too might shake off the numbness of my limbs by walking; <lb/>
            then carefully wiped the sweat from my horse with a handful <lb/>
            of leaves, t stroked his ears, threw the reins over his head, and <lb/>
            walked him along at a gentle pace, until the usual functions <lb/>
            of nature had relieved his weariness.</p>
          <p>And now, while bending down his head, and'cropping the <lb/>
            grass sideways, he was taking his ambulatory breakfast, I made <lb/>
            a third with two persons who were travelling together, and who <lb/>
            happened to be on the road a little before me. While I listened <lb/>
            to hear what was the subject of their conversation, one of them, <lb/>
            bursting .into a loud laugh, said to the other, Do leave off tell­ <lb/>
            ing such absurd, such monstrous ‡ lies."</p>
          <p>Hearing this, I, who am generally athirst after novelty, struck <note type="footnote"> * Plutarch.]-Plutarch, the historian, was a native of Bœotia, and his <lb/>
            nephew, Sextus, the preceptor of Marcus Antoninus, in all probability <lb/>
            lived later than the time of Apuleius. It consequently follows either that <lb/>
            Plutarch of Chæronæa is not the person here meant, or that, if he is, the <lb/>
            allusion to Sextus is a mere gloss. There seems no reason to suppose <lb/>
            that Apuleius refers here to his own descent from Plutarch through his <lb/>
            mother, Salvia, though most of the early commentators adopted that notion. </note><note type="footnote"> t A handful of leaves.]—' Fronde.' Some read ' fronte,' i. e. ' I wiped <lb/>
            the sweat from my horse's forehead.' </note><note type="footnote"> ‡ Monstrous.]—' Immania' seems a preferable reading to 'inania.' </note> <note type="footnote"> B 2 </note> <lb/>

            in, and said, " May I beg you will make me acquainted with <lb/>
            your story; not, indeed, that I would be impertinently inqui­ <lb/>
            sitive, but I long to know everything, or at least as much as <lb/>
            I can; besides, some pleasant amusing tales will smooth the <lb/>
            ruggedness of this hill we are just ascending."</p>
          <p>" Decidedly," said the first speaker, " this lying story is <lb/>
            about as true as if a person should think fit to assert, that by <lb/>
            magical mutterings rapid rivers can be made to run back­ <lb/>
            wards, the ocean be congealed, the winds robbed of breath, the <lb/>
            sun stopped in his course, the moon made to drop her foam,* <lb/>
            the stars plucked from their spheres, the day annihilated, and <lb/>
            the night-indefinitely prolonged."</p>
          <p>On this, assuming a somewhat confident air, " Do not you," <lb/>
            said I, " who began the story, repent of having so done, nor <lb/>
            think it a trouble to tell the remainder." And then, turning <lb/>
            to the other: " But as for you," said I, " you reject with dull <lb/>
            ears and stubborn disposition, a statement of things which, <lb/>
            perhaps, are true. Little are you aware, by Hercules! by <lb/>
            what perversity of opinion those things are thought to be lies, <lb/>
            which appear either novel to the hearing, or strange to the <lb/>
            sight, or at least exalted beyond the range of thought; whereas, <lb/>
            if you examine them a little more attentively, you will find <lb/>
            them not only manifest to the senses, but even easy of accom­ <lb/>
            plishment. Why, it was only last evening, that, while I was <lb/>
            endeavouring to eat faster than my fellow-guests, and to swallow <lb/>
            too large a mouthful of cheesecake, I was all but choked <lb/>
            through the spongy nature of the glutinous morsel sticking <lb/>
            in my throat, and stopping up my breath at the bottom of my <lb/>
            windpipe. And yet, it was but very lately that at Athens, in <lb/>
            front of the Poecile Portico, t I beheld with these two eyes a <lb/>

            moon shed a noxious or poisonous venom or foam, and that sorcerers or <lb/>
            magicians were able to draw her down to the earth by their incantations. <lb/>
            The so-called ' Lunar virus' was a principal ingredient in spells and <lb/>
            magical compositions. </note><note type="footnote"> t Pœcile Portico.]-This portico was so called from the Greek word <lb/>

            And, wondrous to tell! behind the iron head of the spear, at <lb/>
            the part where the handle of the immersed weapon * passed up <lb/>
            the throat, †towards the hinder part of the head, a beautiful <lb/>

            miration of all of us who were present. You would have said <lb/>
            it was the noble serpent, clinging with its slippery coils to the <lb/>
            knotted staff, with half-clipped branches, which the God of <lb/>
            Medicine carries. But you, who began the story, be good <lb/>
            enough to repeat it again, I pray you. I will believe you if <lb/>

            Socrates. He was sitting on the ground, half covered with a <lb/>
            sorry, tattered cloak, and looked almost another person, he was <lb/>
            so miserably wan and thin; just like those outcasts of Fortune, <lb/>

            him with feelings of hesitation.</p>
          <p>" 'How now, friend Socrates,' said I, 'what is the meaning <lb/>
            of this ? Why this appearance ? What crime have you been <lb/>
            guilty of? Why, you have been lamented at home, and for <lb/>

            of food, cheered him with wine, and entertained him with <lb/>
            the news of the day. And now our conversation took quite <lb/>
            a merry turn, we cracked jokes, and grew noisy in our prattle; <lb/>
            when, heaving a bitter sigh from the bottom of his -breast, and <lb/>
            violently striking his forehead with his right hand:</p>
          <p>" 'Miserable man that I am!' said he; 'to have fallen <lb/>
            into these misfortunes while intent on gratifying myself with <lb/>
            a famous gladiatorial spectacle. For, as you are very well <lb/>
            aware, I went to Macedonia on an affair of business; and <lb/>
            after being detained there for the space of ten months, I was <lb/>
            on my return homewards, having gained a very pretty sum of <lb/>
            money. I had nearly reached Larissa, * which I had included <lb/>
            in my route for the purpose of seeing the spectacle I mentioned, <lb/>
            when I was attacked by some desperate robbers, in a lonely and <lb/>
            rugged valley, and only effected my escape, after being plunderer! <lb/>
            by them of all I possessed. Being thus reduced to extreme dis­ <lb/>
            tress, I betook myself to a certain woman named Meroe, who <lb/>
            kept a tavern, and who, though old, was remarkably engaging; <lb/>
            and to her I related the circumstances of my lengthened ab­ <lb/>
            sence, of my earnest desire to reach home, and of my being <note type="footnote"> * Larissa.]-A city of Thessaly, situated near the river Peneus. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="8"/>
            plundered of my property on that day. After I, unfortunate <lb/>
            wretch, had related such particulars as I remembered, she <lb/>
            treated me with the greatest kindness, supplied me with a <lb/>
            good supper, all for nothing, and afterwards, instigated by <lb/>
            lust, admitted me to her bed. But from the very moment that <lb/>
            I, unhappy man, first lay with her, my mind contracted a last­ <lb/>
            ing malady; and I even made her a present of those garments <lb/>
            which the robbers, in their humanity, had left me to cover my <lb/>
            nakedness. I likewise presented her with the little earnings I <lb/>
            made by working as a cloakmaker while I was yet in good con­ <lb/>
            dition of body; until at length this worthy partner, and ill <lb/>
            fortune together, reduced me to that state in which you just <lb/>
            now saw me.'</p>
          <p>" 'By Pollux, then,' said I, ' you deserve to suffer extreme <lb/>
            misfortunes, if there is anything still more extreme than that <lb/>
            which is most extreme, for having preferred the pleasures of <lb/>
            dalliance and a wrinkled harlot, to your home and children.'</p>
          <p>" ' Hush! hush !' said he, raising his forefinger to his mouth, <lb/>
            and looking round with a terror-stricken countenance to see if <lb/>
            he might speak with safety; ' Forbear to revile a woman skilled <lb/>
            in celestial matters, lest you do yourself an injury through an <lb/>
            intemperate tongue.'</p>
          <p>" ' Say you so? said I. ' What kind of woman is this tavern- <lb/>
            keeper, so powerful and queenly ?'</p>
          <p>" ' She is a sorceress,' he replied, ' and endowed with powers <lb/>
            divine; she is able to draw down the heavens, to uplift the <lb/>
            earth, to harden the running water, to dissolve mountains, to <lb/>
            raise the shades of the dead, to dethrone the Gods, to extin­ <lb/>
            guish the stars, and to illumine the depths of Tartarus itself.'</p>
          <p>" Come, come,' said I, 'do draw asunder this tragic curtain,* <lb/>
            and fold up the theatric drop-scene, and let's hear your story <lb/>
            in ordinary parlance.'</p>
          <p>" ' Should you like,' said he, ' to hear of one or two, ay, or a <note type="footnote"> * Tragic curtain.]-The ' siparium' was a piece of tapestry, stretched <lb/>
            on a frame, and, rising before the stage, answered the same purpose as the <lb/>

            peared. Instead of drawing up this curtain to discover the stage and <lb/>
            actors, according to our present practice, it was depressed when the play <lb/>
            began, and fell beneath the level of the stage; whence ' aulæa premuntur, <lb/>
            meant that the play had commenced. ' Aulaea' seems here to mean the <lb/>
            stage curtain, which divided in the middle and was drawn aside : while <lb/>

            and even the Antichthones t themselves; these are only the <lb/>
            leaves, as it were, of her art, and mere trifles. Listen, then, <lb/>
            and hear what she has performed in the presence of many <lb/>
            witnesses. By a single word only, she changed a lover of hers <lb/>
            into a beaver, because he had by force debauched another <lb/>
            woman; since that beast, when in fear of being taken, escapes <lb/>
            from its pursuers by the abscission of its genitals; and she de­ <lb/>
            sired that the same might likewise befall him, as a punishment <lb/>
            for having been connected with another woman. She likewise <lb/>
            changed an innkeeper, who was her neighbour, and of whom <lb/>
            she was envious on that account, into a frog; and now the old <lb/>
            fellow, swimming about in a cask of his own wine, or buried <lb/>
            in the dregs, croaks hoarsely to his old customers, quite in the <lb/>
            way of business. She likewise transformed another person, an <lb/>
            advocate of the Forum, into a ram, because he had conducted <lb/>
            a cause against her ; and to this very day that ram is always at <lb/>
            loggerheads..+ Then there was the wife of a lover of hers, ,whom <lb/>
            she condemned to perpetual pregnancy, when on the point of <lb/>
            increasing her family, by closing her womb against the egress <lb/>
            of the infant, because she had chattered scandal against the <lb/>
            witch; and, for these eight years, according to the general <lb/>
            computation, this poor creature has been swelling with her <lb/>
            burden, as if she were about to be brought to bed of an elephant. §</p>
          <p>" After this woman, however, and many other persons, had <lb/>
            been injured by her arts, the public indignation became <lb/>
            aroused against her; and it was determined that on the follow­ <lb/>

            by stoning her to death. But, by the power of her enchant- <note type="footnote"> * The Æthiopias.]-The eastern and the western, separated from each <lb/>

            ments, she frustrated this design: and as Medea, having <lb/>
            obtained by entreaty from Creon the truce of a single day, <lb/>
            prior to her departure, burned his whole palace, his daughter, <lb/>
            together with the old man himself, with flames issuing from <lb/>
            a garland, so, likewise, did this sorceress, having performed <lb/>
            certain deadly incantations in a ditch,* (as she herself lately <lb/>
            told me in a fit of drunkenness), confine all the inhabitants <lb/>
            of the town, each in his own house, through a secret spell of <lb/>
            the daemons; so that, for two whole days together, neither <lb/>
            could the bars be wrenched off, nor the doors be taken off the <lb/>
            hinges, nor, in fine, could a breach be made in the walls; until, <lb/>
            by mutual consent, the people unanimously cried out, and <lb/>
            swore in the most sacred manner, that they would not lift a <lb/>
            hand against her, and would, in case any one should think of <lb/>
            so doing, afford her timely assistance. Being after this man­ <lb/>
            ner appeased, she liberated the whole city.</p>
          <p>" In the middle of the night, however, she conveyed the <lb/>
            author of this conspiracy, together with all his house, that is <lb/>
            to say, with the walls, the very ground, and all the foundations, <lb/>
            close shut as it was, into another city, situate at the hundredth <lb/>
            milestone hence, and on the summit of a craggy mountain, <lb/>
            in consequence of which it is deprived of water. And, as the <lb/>
            dwellings of the inhabitants were built so close together, that <lb/>
            they did not afford room to this new comer, she threw down <lb/>
            the house before the gate of the city, and took her departure."</p>
          <p>" " You narrate,' said I, 'marvellous things, my good Socra­ <lb/>
            tes, and no less terrible than marvellous. In fine, you have <lb/>
            excited in me too, no small anxiety, indeed, I may say, fear, <lb/>
            not inoculating me with a mere grain of apprehension, but <lb/>
            piercing me with dread as with a spear, lest this old hag, em­ <lb/>

            should come to know this conversation of ours. Let us, there­ <lb/>

          <p>11 While I was yet advising him thus, the worthy Socrates, <lb/>
            overcome by more wine than he had been accustomed to, and <lb/>
            by the. fatigue of the day, had fallen asleep, and was now <note type="footnote"> * Incantations in a ditch.]-Sacrifices to celestial gods were offered on <lb/>

            snoring aloud. Shutting the door, therefore, securing the <lb/>
            bolts, and placing my bed close against the hinges, I tossed it <lb/>
            up well, and lay down upon it. At first, indeed, I lay awake <lb/>
            some time through fear, but closed my eyes at last a little about <lb/>
            the third watch.*</p>
          <p>"I had just fallen asleep, when suddenly the door was burst <lb/>
            open with too great violence for one to believe that it was <lb/>
            robbers; nay, tie hinges being entirely broken and wrenched <lb/>
            off, it was thrown to the ground. The bedstead, too, which <lb/>
            was but small, wanting one foot, and rotten, was thrown down <lb/>
            with tne violence of the shock, and falling upon me, who had <lb/>
            been rolled out and pitched upon the ground, completely covered <lb/>
            and concealed me. Then was I sensible that certain emotions <lb/>
            of the mind are naturally excited by contrary causes. For as <lb/>
            tears very often proceed from joy, so, amid my extreme fear, <lb/>
            I could not refrain from laughing, to see myself turned, <lb/>
            from Aristomenes, into a tortoise.t And so, while prostrate <lb/>
            on the floor, peeping askance to see what was the matter, and <lb/>
            completely covered by the bed, I espied two women, of ad­ <lb/>
            vanced age, one of whom carried a lighted lamp, and the other <lb/>
            a sponge and a drawn sword. Thus equipped, they planted <lb/>
            themselves on either side of Socrates, who was fast asleep.</p>
          <p>" She who carried the sword then addressed the other, , This, <lb/>
            sister Panthia, is my dear Endymion,‡my Ganymede, § who <lb/>
            by day and by night, hath laughed my youthful age to scorn. <lb/>
            This is he who, despising my passion, not only defames me with <lb/>
            abusive language, but is preparing also for flight-and I, for­ <lb/>
            sooth, deserted through the craft of this Ulysses, just like <lb/>
            another Calypso, am to be left to lament in eternal loneliness.'</p>
          <p>" Then extending her right hand, and pointing me out to her <lb/>
            friend Panthia; ' And there,' said she, ' is his worthy coun­ <lb/>

            who now, half dead, is lying flat on the ground beneath <lb/>

            recent loquacity, and his present inquisitiveness.'</p>
          <p>" On hearing this, wretch that I was, I felt myself streaming <lb/>
            with cold perspiration, and my vitals began to throb with agi­ <lb/>
            tation ; so much so, that even the bedstead, shaken by the <lb/>
            violence of ray palpitations, moved up and down upon my back.</p>
          <p>" ' Well, sister,' said the worthy Panthia, " shall we hack him <lb/>
            to pieces at once, after the fashion of the Bacchanals, or, shall <lb/>
            we bind his limbs and deprive him of virility ?'</p>
          <p>" To this, Meroë replied-for I perceived from the circum­ <lb/>
            stances, as well as from the narrative of Socrates, how well that <lb/>
            name fitted her*—' Rather let him live, if only that he may <lb/>
            cover with a little earth the body of this wretched creature.' <lb/>
            Then, moving the head of Socrates to one side, she plunged <lb/>
            the whole sword into him up to the hilt, through the left side <lb/>
            of his throat, carefully receiving the flowing blood into a small <lb/>
            leathern bottle, placed under it, so that not a drop of it was any­ <lb/>
            where to be seen. All this did I witness with my own eyes; <lb/>
            and, what is more, the worthy Meroë, that she might not, I <lb/>
            suppose, omit any due observance in the sacrifice of the victim, <lb/>
            thrusting her right hand through the wound, into the very <lb/>
            entrails, and groping among them, drew forth the heart of my <lb/>
            unhappy companion; while, his windpipe being severed by the <lb/>
            thrust of the weapon, he emitted through the wound a voice, <lb/>
            or rather I should say, an indistinct gurgling noise, and poured <lb/>
            forth his spirit with his bubbling blood. Panthia then stopped <lb/>
            the gaping wound with the sponge, exclaiming, ' Beware, 0 <lb/>
            sea-born sponge, how thou dost pass through a river.'</p>
          <p>"When she had thus said, they lifted my bed from the ground, <lb/>
            and squatting astride over my face, discharged their bladders, <lb/>
            until they had entirely drenched me with their most filthy <lb/>
            contents. <note type="footnote"> * How well that name fitted her.]-Ausonius, Epigram xix., explains <lb/>
            this allusion : <lb/>

            to their sockets. But I, left in such a plight, prostrate on the <lb/>

            like some babe that has recently emerged from the womb of <lb/>

            Is a man's throat to be cut before your eyes, and are you to be <lb/>
            silent ? How was it you were not likewise assassinated ? Why <lb/>
            did the barbarous wretch spare you, a witness of the murder, <lb/>

            verty ? Are you ignorant, you simpleton, that he who is naked <lb/>
            cannot be stripped by ten athletes even ?' <pb n="14"/>
            </p>
          <p>" The drowsy porter, turning himself on his other side, made <lb/>
            answer, ' And how am I to know that you have not mur­ <lb/>
            dered that fellow-traveller of yours, with whom you came <lb/>
            hither last night, and are now consulting your safety in night ? <lb/>
            And now I recollect that just at that hour I saw the depths <lb/>
            of Tartarus *' through the yawning earth and in them the dog <lb/>
            Cerberus, looking ready to devour me.'</p>
          <p>" Then truly I came to the conclusion that the worthy Meroë <lb/>
            had not spared my throat through any compassion, but that <lb/>
            she had cruelly reserved me for the cross. † Accordingly, on <lb/>
            returning to my chamber, I thought about some speedy mode <lb/>
            of putting an end to myself: but as Fortune had provided me <lb/>
            with no weapon with which to commit self-destruction, except <lb/>
            the bedstead alone-, Now, bedstead,' said I, ' most dear to my <lb/>
            soul, who hast been partner with me in enduring so many <lb/>
            sorrows, who art fully conscious, and a spectator of this night's <lb/>
            events, and whom alone, when accused, I can adduce as a <lb/>
            witness of my innocence, do thou supply me, who would fain <lb/>
            hasten to the shades below, with a welcome instrument of <lb/>
            death.'</p>
          <p>" Thus saying, I began to undo the rope with which the <lb/>
            bed was corded, and throwing one end of it over a small beam <lb/>
            which projected above the window, and there fastening it, <lb/>
            and making a strong slip-knot at the other end, I mounted <lb/>
            upon the bed, and thus elevated for my own destruction, I <lb/>
            put my head into the noose. But while with one foot I was <lb/>
            kicking away the support on which I rested, so that the <lb/>
            noose, being tightened about my throat by the strain of my <lb/>
            weight, might stop the functions of my breath ; the rope, <lb/>
            which was old and rotten, broke asunder, and falling from aloft, <lb/>
            I tumbled with great force upon Socrates (for he was lying <lb/>
            close by), and rolled with him on to the floor.</p>
          <p>" Lo and behold! at the very same instant the porter burst <lb/>
            into the room, bawling out, ' Where are you, you who were <note type="footnote"> * Saw the depths of Tartarus.]-Of course in a dream. Just at that <lb/>
            hour :-He knows all about it, even to the precise time. The prompt!. <lb/>
            tude with which the porter decides from the evidence of his dream that <lb/>

            in such monstrous haste to be off at midnight, and now lie <lb/>
            snoring, rolled up in the bed-clothes ?'</p>
          <p>"At these words, whether awakened by my fall, or by <lb/>
            the discordant notes of the porter, I know not, Socrates was <lb/>
            the first to start up, and exclaim, ' Assuredly, it is not <lb/>
            without good reason that all travellers detest these hostlers. <lb/>
            For this troublesome fellow, intruding so impertinently, with <lb/>
            the intention, no doubt, of stealing something, has roused me <lb/>
            out of a sound sleep, by his outrageous bellowing.'</p>
          <p>" On hearing him speak, I jumped up briskly, in an ecstasy <lb/>
            of unhoped-for joy: 'Faithfullest of porters,' I exclaimed, <lb/>
            ' my friend, my own father, and my brother, behold him whom <lb/>
            you, in your drunken fit, falsely accused me of having mur­ <lb/>
            dered.' So saying, I embraced Socrates, and was for loading <lb/>
            him with kisses; but he, being assailed by the stench of the <lb/>
            most filthy liquor with which those hags* had drenched me, <lb/>
            repulsed me with considerable violence. ' Get out with you,' <lb/>
            he cried, ' for you stink like the bottom of a sewer,' and then <lb/>
            began jocularly to enquire the cause of this nasty smell. <lb/>
            Sorely confused, I trumped up some absurd story on the spur <lb/>
            of the moment, to give another turn to the conversation, and, <lb/>
            taking him by the right hand, ' Why not be off,' said I, ' and <lb/>
            enjoy the freshness of the morning on our journey ?' So I took <lb/>
            my bundle, and, having paid the innkeeper for our night's <lb/>
            lodging, we started on our road.</p>
          <p>"We had proceeded some little distance, and now every <lb/>
            thing being illumined by the beams of the rising sun, I keenly <lb/>
            and attentively examined that part of my companion's neck, <lb/>
            into which I had seen the sword plunged. 'Foolish man,' <lb/>
            said I to myself, ' buried in your cups, you certainly have had a <lb/>
            most absurd dream. Why look, here's Socrates safe, sound, <lb/>
            and hearty. Where is the wound ? where is the sponge ? <lb/>
            where, in fine, is the scar of a wound, so deep, and so recent ?'</p>
          <p>" Addressing myself to him, ' Decidedly,' said I, ' skilful <lb/>
            doctors have good reason to be of opinion that it is those who <lb/>
            are stuffed out with food and fermented liquors who are trou­ <lb/>

            instance of this: for having in my evening cups exceeded the <lb/>
            bounds of temperance, a wretched night has been presenting <lb/>
            to me shocking and dreadful visions, so that I still fancy my­ <lb/>
            self besprinkled and defiled with human gore.'</p>
          <p>" ' 'Tis not gore,' he replied with a smile, ' you are sprinkled <lb/>
            with, but chamber-lye; and yet I too, thought, in my sleep, <lb/>
            that my throat was cut: some pain, too, I felt in my neck, <lb/>
            and I fancied that my very heart was being plucked out: and <lb/>
            even now I am quite faint, my knees tremble, I stagger as I <lb/>
            go, and feel in want of some food to refresh my spirits.'</p>
          <p>" ' Look,' cried I, 1 here's breakfast all ready for you;' and <lb/>
            so saying, I lifted my wallet from off my shoulders, and at <lb/>
            once handed him some cheese and bread, saying, ' Let us sit <lb/>
            down near that plane-tree.'</p>
          <p>" We did so, and I also helped myself to some refresh­ <lb/>
            ment. While looking at him somewhat more intently, as <lb/>
            he was eating with a voracious appetite, I saw that he was <lb/>
            faint, and of a hue like box-wood; his natural colour in <lb/>
            fact had so forsaken him, that as I recalled those nocturnal <lb/>
            furies to my frightened imagination, the very first piece of <lb/>
            bread I put into my mouth, though a very tiny bit, stuck in the <lb/>
            middle of my throat, so that it could neither pass downward, <lb/>
            nor yet return upward. And then besides, the number of people <lb/>
            passing along increased my apprehensions; for who would be­ <lb/>
            lieve that one of two companions could meet with his death <lb/>
            without any harm done by the other ?</p>
          <p>"Meanwhile, after having devoured a sufficient quantity <lb/>
            of food, he began to be impatient for some drink; for he bad <lb/>
            voraciously eaten a good part of a most excellent cheese; and <lb/>
            not very far from the roots of the plane tree, a gentle stream <lb/>
            flowed slowly along, just like a placid lake, rivalling silver or <lb/>
            glass in its lustre. ' Look,' said I, 1 drink your fill of the water <lb/>
            of this stream, bright as the Milky Way.'</p>
          <p>" He arose, and, wrapping himself in his cloak, * with his <lb/>
            knees doubled under him, knelt down upon the shelving bank, <lb/>
            and bent greedily towards the water. Scarcely had he <lb/>
            touched the dewy surface of the water with the edge of his <lb/>
            lips, when the wound in his throat burst wide open, the <lb/>
            sponge suddenly rolled out, a few drops of blood accom­ <lb/>
            panying it; and then, his body, bereft of life, would have <note type="footnote"> * In his cloak.]—' Palliolo' seems a preferable reading to ' paululum.' </note> <pb n="17"/>

            fallen into the river, had I not laid hold of one of his feet, and <lb/>
            dragged it with the utmost difficulty and labour to the top of the <lb/>
            bank; where, having, as well as the time permitted, lamented <lb/>
            my unfortunate companion, I buried him in the sandy soil <lb/>
            that eternally begirt the stream. For my own part, trem­ <lb/>
            bling and terror-stricken, I fled through various and unfre­ <lb/>
            quented places ; and, as though conscious of the guilt of homi­ <lb/>
            cide, abandoning my country and my home, and embracing a <lb/>
            voluntary exile, I now dwell in Ætolia, where I have married <lb/>
            another wife."</p>
          <p>END OF THE FIRST EPISODE.</p>
          <p>Here Aristomenes ended his story, but his companion, who <lb/>
            from the very first had rejected it with obstinate incredulity, <lb/>
            at once exclaimed, " Nothing is there in fable more fabulous <lb/>
            than this story, nothing more absurd than these lies." Then <lb/>
            turning to me: " And you," said he, " who are a person of <lb/>
            liberal education, as your dress and appearance bespeak, do you <lb/>
            give credit to this story ?"</p>
          <p>I replied, "1 consider nothing impossible, but hold that <lb/>
            just as the Fates have preordained, so all things happen to <lb/>
            mortals.' For both to me and to you, and to all men, many <lb/>
            things do happen of so wonderful a nature, that they are nigh <lb/>
            to not happening at all; which, nevertheless, if narrated to <lb/>
            an ignorant person, would fail to obtain belief. But this <lb/>
            story, by Hercules, I do believe, and I return right hearty <lb/>
            thanks to the narrator, for having so well entertained us by his <lb/>
            pleasant recital, that I have got over a rough and tedious por­ <lb/>
            tion of my journey without labour or weariness. With this <lb/>
            good service, I fancy that this nag of mine is also much grati­ <lb/>
            fied, inasmuch as I have been carried, without fatigue to him, up <lb/>
            to the very gate of this city, not on his back, but by my ears."</p>
          <p>This was the termination of our conversation and of our <lb/>
            journey together; for both my fellow-travellers turned away <lb/>
            to some neighbouring villages on the left; while I approached <lb/>
            the first inn I cast eyes upon, and at once accosted the old <lb/>
            woman who kept it: "Is this the city of Hypata?" said I; <lb/>
            she gave me to understand, by a nod, that it was. " Do you <lb/>
            know," said I, " a certain person of the name of Milo, who is <note type="footnote"> c </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="18"/>
            one of the first men of the city ?" She smiled, and replied, <lb/>
            " With good reason is this Milo considered one of the first* <lb/>
            men, inasmuch as he dwells beyond the whole city, and in <lb/>
            the Pomœrium." † "Joking apart," said I, " tell me, I beg <lb/>
            of you, good mother, what kind of man he is, and in what <lb/>
            house he lives."</p>
          <p>" Do you see," said she, " those last windows which look on <lb/>
            this side towards the city, and that gate on the other side, <lb/>
            looking upon the blind alley in front ? There it is that Milo <lb/>
            dwells, a man abounding in money, and extremely opulent; <lb/>
            but disgraced by inordinate avarice and shameful sordidness. <lb/>
            In short, he entirely devotes himself to usury, taking, pledges <lb/>
            of gold and silver. Shut up in a scanty house, and always <lb/>
            bending over his pelf, there he dwells with a wife, the partner <lb/>
            of his misery. And no one besides does he keep in his house, <lb/>
            except one servant girl; and when he goes abroad, he is al­ <lb/>
            ways dressed like a common beggar."</p>
          <p>" Well," said I to myself, with a smile, " my friend De­ <lb/>
            meas has taken excellent care of me, in giving me a letter <lb/>
            of introduction to such a man; while I stay with him I need <lb/>
            not be afraid of smoke, or the smell of the kitchen."</p>
          <p>Thus saying, and proceeding to a little distance, I came to <lb/>
            the gate, which was strongly bolted, and began to hallo and <lb/>
            knock.</p>
          <p>At length, a damsel came out, and said, " Hallo ! you who <lb/>
            have been knocking at our door so violently, what is the pledge <lb/>
            on which you want to borrow money ? Are you the only <lb/>
            person that doesn't know that we take in no pledge except it <lb/>
            is gold or silver ?"</p>
          <p>" Meet me with words of better omen," said I, " and rather <lb/>
            inform me, whether I have found your master at home ?"</p>
          <p>"Certainly," she replied; but what is the cause of your <lb/>
            enquiry ?" <note type="footnote"> * One of the first.] - The landlady puns on the word ' primus.' He <lb/>

            the city auspices were to be taken. The limits of the ' Pomoerium' were <lb/>
            marked by stone pillars at certain distances. </note> <pb n="19"/>

          <p><note type="margin">BOOK I. </note> "I have brought a letter," said I, "written to him by <lb/>
            Demeas, the duumvir of Corinth." *</p>
          <p>" Wait here," said she, " while I deliver your message to <lb/>
            him." And so saying, she fastened the door again, and re­ <lb/>
            turned into the house.</p>
          <p>She came back in a few minutes, and, opening the door, <lb/>
            said, "My master requests you to come in." I accordingly <lb/>
            entered, and found him reclining on a very small couch, and <lb/>
            just beginning his dinner. His wife was sitting at his feet,t <lb/>
            and a scantily furnished table was before them; pointing at <lb/>
            which, he said, " Behold your entertainment."</p>
          <p>" 'Tis well," said I, and immediately delivered him the <lb/>
            letter from Demeas. Having hastily read it, he said, " I thank <lb/>
            my friend Demeas for having introduced to me such a worthy <lb/>
            guest:" and then he ordered his wife to leave the room,j and <lb/>
            invited me to sit in her place; at the same time taking hold of <lb/>
            my garment, and drawing me towards him, as I still hesitated <lb/>
            through bashfulness. " Sit down there," said he, " for through <lb/>
            fear of robbers, we cannot provide ourselves with seats, nor <lb/>
            even as much other furniture as we have need of." I did so.</p>
          <p>"From the genteel appearance of your person," he conti­ <lb/>
            nued, ' and from this maiden bashfulness of yours, I might <lb/>

            dain the slender hospitality of the aged woman Hecale."t</p>
          <p>Then, calling to the maid-servant, "Fotis," said he, "take <lb/>
            the baggage of our guest, and put it with care in that bed- <lb/>
            chamber, and at the same time, bring quickly from the store- <lb/>
            room some oil for anointing, towels for drying, and other needful <lb/>
            things useful, and then conduct my guest to the nearest baths; <lb/>
            for he must be weary after his very long and toilsome journey."</p>
          <p>On hearing these directions, I reflected upon the mode of liv­ <lb/>
            ing, and the parsimonious habits of Milo, and wishing to in­ <lb/>
            gratiate myself with him in a still greater degree-,, I do not <lb/>
            stand in need of any of these things," said I, " as I generally <lb/>
            carry them with me on a journey. And as to the baths, I can <lb/>
            easily find my way thither by enquiring where they are. My <lb/>
            principal concern is for my horse, who has so stoutly carried <lb/>
            me hither ; do you, therefore, Fotis, take this money, and buy <lb/>
            me some hay and barley."</p>
          <p>When matters were arranged, and my things had been put <lb/>
            into the bedchamber, I went into the provision market on my <lb/>
            road towards the baths, that I might first provide us with <lb/>
            something in the way of eating. There I saw a splendid sup­ <lb/>
            ply of fish on sale, and after asking the price of some, and <lb/>
            declining it, because the dealer asked a hundred pieces ‡ of <lb/>
            money, I finally bought it for twenty denars. Just as I was <lb/>
            going away from there, I was followed out by one Pytheas, <lb/>
            who had been a fellow-student of mine at Athens; who, after <lb/>
            having recognised me at last, embraced me in a friendly manner, <lb/>
            and exclaimed, "By Gemini, friend Lucius, what a time it is <lb/>
            since I last saw you! By Hercules ! not since we left our mas­ <lb/>
            ter and quitted the city.§ But what is the cause of this journey <lb/>

            meaning of this ? I heartily congratulate you; for I perceive <lb/>
            attendants and the fasces, and a dress that fully bespeaks the <lb/>
            magisterial office."</p>
          <p>He replied, " I have the inspection of the markets* and hold <lb/>
            the office of ædile, and if it is your wish to buy any provisions, I <lb/>
            will take care and accommodate you." I declined his offer, <lb/>
            as I had already provided myself with a sufficient quantity of <lb/>
            fish for my dinner.</p>
          <p>Pytheas, however, having caught sight of my basket, and <lb/>
            shaking up the fishes, that he might inspect them the better- <lb/>
            "And pray," said he, what sum may you have given for <lb/>
            this rubbish?"</p>
          <p>"It was with considerable trouble," said I, " that I could <lb/>
            get the fishmonger to take twenty denars for them." On <lb/>
            hearing this, he immediately seized me by the right hand, <lb/>
            and bringing me back again into the market:</p>
          <p>"From which of these men did you buy this worthless <lb/>
            stuff?" said he.</p>
          <p>I pointed out to him a little old man, who was sitting in one <lb/>
            corner; upon which, immediately rebuking him in a most se­ <lb/>
            vere tone of voice, in virtue of his authority as sedile, , How <lb/>
            now!" said he, "have you no consideration for our friends, <lb/>
            not to say for strangers, . to sell your pitiful fish at such an <lb/>
            exorbitant price, and thus bring this city, the flower of the <lb/>
            province of Thessaly, to be as bad as a desert and a rock, <lb/>
            through the dearness of provisions ? But you shall not escape <lb/>
            with impunity. For I will soon make you know how rogues <lb/>
            are to be kept in order, as long as I am magistrate."</p>
          <p>Then, emptying the basket upon the ground, he ordered one <lb/>
            of his officers to jump upon the fish, and trample the. whole <lb/>
            of them to pieces under his feet. Content with this infliction <lb/>
            of moral discipline, my friend Pytheas, recommended me to de­ <lb/>
            part; "for," said he, "my dear Lucius, I have sufficiently <lb/>
            disgraced this little old fellow."</p>
          <p>Astonished and dumb-foundered, at finding myself deprived <lb/>
            of both money and supper, through the clever device of my <lb/>
            knowing fellow-student, I betook myself to the baths. After <lb/>
            bathing, I returned to the house of Milo, and was going to <note type="footnote"> * Inspection of the markets.]-This officer, whose duties corresponded <lb/>

            my bedchamber, when the maid-servant, Fotis, said, " Your <lb/>
            host invites you to supper."</p>
          <p>I, however, who was already aware of the parsimony of <lb/>
            Milo, courteously endeavoured to excuse myself by saying, that <lb/>
            I thought the fatigue of the journey would be repaired not <lb/>
            so much by food, as by sleep. Milo, however, on receiving this <lb/>
            message, came himself, and taking me by the right hand, <lb/>
            politely tried to lead me in to supper; and when I hung back, <lb/>
            made a little resistance—"I will not quit you," said he," un­ <lb/>
            til you accompany me." At the same time, enforcing his <lb/>
            words with an oath, he led me, thus obliged reluctantly to give <lb/>
            way to his perseverance, to that same couch of his.</p>
          <p>When I was seated-" And how is our friend Demeas?" <lb/>
            said he. " Are things going on prosperously with him ? How <lb/>
            is his wife ? Are his children well ? What about his ser­ <lb/>
            vants ?" I answered every one of his enquiries. He then <lb/>
            minutely questioned me as to the object of my journey; after <lb/>
            I had fully informed him, he next asked me, with the most <lb/>
            scrupulous inquisitiveness, concerning my country, and the <lb/>
            principal people there ; and, lastly, he was enquiring about our <lb/>

            stopped short in the middle of my sentences, and that, quite <lb/>

          <p>So soon as a new sun had dispersed the night, and ushered in­ <lb/>
            the day, I awoke and jumped out of bed; being by nature <lb/>
            anxious and, indeed, over-desirous of becoming acquainted with <lb/>
            whatever is rare and admirable, I called to mind that I was <lb/>
            in the very heart of Thessaly,* celebrated, by the unanimous <lb/>
            consent of the whole world, as the land where the incantations <lb/>
            of the magic art are indigenous., and in that very city which <lb/>
            was the scene of the story of my worthy fellow-traveller Aris­ <lb/>
            tomenes. Excited in the highest degree by my longing de­ <lb/>
            sire and my ardent temperament, I examined everything with <lb/>
            eager curiosity.</p>
          <p>Indeed, there was nothing in that city, which on beholding, <lb/>
            I could believe to be what it really was; but I fancied that <lb/>
            everything was utterly transformed into another shape by <lb/>
            means of some deadly spell, that the stones I kicked against <lb/>
            were petrified men, that the birds I heard singing, were men <lb/>
            transformed and feathered, that the trees which surrounded the <lb/>
            pomoerium, were people in like manner, covered with leaves, <lb/>
            and that the fountains of water flowed forth from the liquefied <lb/>
            human bodies.</p>
          <p>I was every instant expecting that the statues and pictures <lb/>
            would take to walking, that the walls would speak, that oxen <note type="footnote"> * Heart of Thessaly.]-Thessaly is spoken of by many of the ancient <lb/>
            writers as the fruitful source of magic and incantation. Indeed, we find <lb/>
            the name ' Thessala' used by Plautus and Horace to denote a witch or <lb/>
            sorceress. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="24"/>
            and cattle of all kinds would utter prophecies,* and that an oracle <lb/>
            would issue on a sudden from the rays of the sun in heaven.</p>
          <p>Thus bewildered, indeed I may say stupefied with torment­ <lb/>
            ing anxiety, perceiving no likelihood or even trace of the ob­ <lb/>
            jects of my wishes, I perambulated the whole city. Wandering <lb/>
            in this way just like one intoxicated, from door to door, I <lb/>
            suddenly, without knowing where I was, found myself in the <lb/>
            provision market.</p>
          <p>Here, as it happened, quickening my pace, I overtook a <lb/>
            lady, who was walking along, attended by a great retinue <lb/>
            of domestics. The gold that hung on her cheeks and her <lb/>
            embroidered garments, bespoke her to be, beyond a doubt, a <lb/>
            woman of the highest rank. Close by her side walked a man <lb/>
            considerably advanced in years, who, the moment he saw me, <lb/>
            exclaimed, " By Hercules ! here is Lucius," and at the same <lb/>
            moment embraced me, after which he whispered in the lady's <lb/>
            ear something I could not hear.</p>
          <p>" And will you not, then," said he, " approach and salute <lb/>
            your parent ? "t</p>
          <p>" I dare not," I replied, " salute a lady whom I do not <lb/>
            know;" and immediately the colour rising to my cheeks, I <lb/>
            turned away my head and stood stock still; while the lady <lb/>
            looked at me with a steady gaze.</p>
          <p>" Behold," said she, " the high-born breeding of his most <lb/>
            virtuous mother Salvia;‡ and then, his person bears an inex­ <lb/>
            pressible resemblance to hers in every particular; tall, yet <lb/>

            complexion, hair yellow, and arranged without foppery, § eyes <note type="footnote"> * Utter prophecies.]-Lucant in the Pharsalia, i. 561, mentions as an <lb/>

            of the disasters which would ensue on Hannibal's arrival in Italy. One <lb/>
            of the Scholiasts on Lucan says, that in the civil wars between Cæsar <lb/>
            and Pompey, an ass spoke; another informs us that an ox spoke while <lb/>
            ploughing, in reproof of his driver, and told him that it was useless to <lb/>
            urge him on, for soon there would be no people left in Italy to consume <lb/>
            the produce of the fields. </note><note type="footnote"> t Salute your parents.]-The word ' parens ' here is indicative of es­ <lb/>

            grey but keen, and glancing in all directions as brightly as an <lb/>
            eagle's; in short, he is comely in every point, and his carriage <lb/>
            is graceful and unaffected."</p>
          <p>Then addressing herself to me, she added, " In these very <lb/>
            arms of mine, Lucius, have I nursed you, and, indeed, how <lb/>
            could it be otherwise? seeing that I not only participated <lb/>
            with your mother in blood, but was brought up along with <lb/>
            her. For we are both descended from the family of Plutarch, <lb/>
            both of us sucked the breast of the same nurse, and grew up to­ <lb/>
            gether in the ties of sisterhood; nor is there any other differ­ <lb/>
            ence between us, except that of rank; for while she contracted <lb/>
            a splendid alliance, I married a person in a private station. I <lb/>
            am that Byrrhæna, whose name, probably, you may recollect, <lb/>
            as having been frequently mentioned among those who brought <lb/>
            you up. Come, therefore, with all confidence to our house, <lb/>
            or rather, I would say, to your own home."</p>
          <p>Having had time to digest my bashfulness while the lady <lb/>
            was speaking, I replied, " Far be it from me, my parent, that <lb/>
            I should leave my entertainer, Milo, without any just cause of <lb/>
            complaint. Nevertheless I will take care not to fail in what­ <lb/>
            ever can be done without a breach of the courtesies of hos­ <lb/>
            pitality. And as often as I shall have occasion hereafter to <lb/>
            come this way, I will be sure to call upon you."</p>
          <p>Conversing in this way, we had proceeded but a few paces, <lb/>
            ere we arrived at Byrrhæna's house. The hall* was most <lb/>
            beautiful, and had statues of the goddess of Victory, † raised <lb/>
            on pillars which stood at the four corners. The wings of the <lb/>
            figures were expanded; their dewy feet seemed to brush the <lb/>
            surface of a rolling sphere, although it moved not; and they <lb/>
            looked, not as if they were attached to it, but hovered in the <lb/>
            air. A statue of Diana, in Parian marble, occupied a level space <lb/>
            in the middle of the enclosure. The figure was singularly beau- <note type="footnote"> the ancients, but only fops and debauchees expended their time on curling <lb/>
            or dressing the hair. Apuleius inveighs against the practice in his ' Apo­ <lb/>
            logia.' </note><note type="footnote"> * The hall.]-The 'atrium' was not properly the 'hall' of a house <lb/>
            in our sense of the word, but was a spacious room beyond the vestibule, <lb/>
            lighted from above, and into which the other rooms on the ground floor <lb/>
            opened. </note><note type="footnote"> t Goddess of Victory.]-' Palmaris Deae.' Literally, the ' palm-holding <lb/>
            goddess,' in reference to the branch of palm which the Goddess of Victory <lb/>
            was represented as holding in her hand. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="26"/>
            tiful; the garments of the goddess were blown back by the wind; <lb/>
            she seemed in the act of running directly towards you as you <lb/>
            entered, and awed you by the majesty of her godlike form. <lb/>
            Dogs supported the goddess on either side, and these, too, were <lb/>
            of marble. Their eyes were fierce and threatening, their ears <lb/>
            erect, their nostrils open, their jaws agape to devour ; and had <lb/>
            any barking been heard in the neighbourhood, you would have <lb/>
            thought it proceeded from those marble throats. A thing, also, <lb/>
            in which the excellent sculptor had given proof of the most <lb/>
            consummate art, was this, that the fore feet of the dogs, up­ <lb/>
            lifted to their chests, were in the act of running, while the <lb/>
            hind feet pressed the ground. At the back of the goddess <lb/>
            stood a rock, wrought to resemble a grotto, overgrown with <lb/>
            moss, grass, leaves, and brushwood; with vines and shrubs <lb/>
            here and there; and the reflection of the statue gleamed from <lb/>
            the polished marble within the grotto. Over the extreme edge <lb/>
            of the rock hung apples and grapes, most exquisitely wrought, <lb/>
            and in which art, rivalling nature, had so counterfeited their <lb/>
            originals, that you would have thought they might be gathered <lb/>
            for eating, when fragrant autumn had breathed upon them the <lb/>
            tints of maturity. And if, leaning forward, you had beheld the <lb/>
            streamlets, which gently rippled as they ran beneath the feet <lb/>
            of the goddess, you would have thought that, like clusters of <lb/>
            grapes which hang from the vine, they too resembled real life <lb/>
            in the faculty of motion.</p>
          <p>In the midst of the foliage was Action, carved in marble, <lb/>
            peering over his shoulders, and at the very instant changed <lb/>
            into the wild form of a stag; and both in the marble and in <lb/>
            the reflection of the stream he was seen lying in ambush, await­ <lb/>
            ing the coming of Diana to bathe.</p>
          <p>While I was inspecting these various objects with eager <lb/>
            curiosity and delight, "Everything you see," said Byrhæna, <lb/>
            " is yours;" and she then privately ordered all the other per­ <lb/>
            sons to depart. After they were gone, " I take this goddess* <lb/>
            to witness," said she, "my dearest Lucius, how great are the <lb/>
            anxious apprehensions I entertain for you, and how earnestly <lb/>
            I desire that you, who are as it were my son, should be put <lb/>
            upon your guard. Beware, resolutely beware of the wicked <lb/>

            ments, takes possession of his heart, and enthrals him in eternal <lb/>
            fetters of profound love; but as for those who are not suffi­ <lb/>

            your youth and your good looks, are exactly fitted for her pur­ <lb/>
            pose."</p>
          <p>Thus did Byrrhæna counsel me in a most anxious tone.</p>
          <p>I, however, who was naturally of an inquisitive turn, as <lb/>
            soon as I heard the name of the magic art, a name that had <lb/>
            ever been the object of my aspirations, was so far from feel- <lb/>
            in,, inclined to be on my guard against Pamphile, that, moved <lb/>
            by an irresistible impulse, I even longed to devote myself to <lb/>
            such pursuits, even though it should cost me dear, and to pre­ <lb/>
            cipitate myself, with a running leap, into the very abyss of <lb/>

          <p>Wild with excitement, then, I quickly released myself from <lb/>
            the grasp of her hand, as though from some chain, and hastily <lb/>
            bidding her adieu, I flew at the top of my speed to the house <lb/>
            of Milo; and while I thus scoured along, just like a person <lb/>
            out of his senses, " Now then, Lucius," said I, " look sharp, <lb/>
            and have your wits about you. You have now the long- <lb/>
            wished-for opportunity, and may satiate your mind with mira­ <lb/>
            culous stories, as for many a day you have been longing to do. <lb/>
            Away then with puerile apprehensions, grapple with this ad­ <lb/>

            stain from amorous dalliance with the wife of your host, and <lb/>
            religiously respect the conjugal bed of the worthy Milo. But, <lb/>
            on the other hand, you may lay siege to the maid-servant Fotis; <lb/>
            for she is of charming form, of lively manners, and a pleasant <lb/>
            tongue. Yesterday evening too, when you went to rest, she <lb/>
            politely escorted you into the bedchamber, helped you atten­ <lb/>
            tively into bed, tucked you up very lovingly, and then giving <lb/>
            you a kiss, betrayed by her countenance how loth she was to leave <lb/>
            you; and lastly, she stood still more than once, and turned <lb/>
            round to look at you. Good luck be your speed then !* but <lb/>
            come what may, have at this Fotis."</p>
          <p>While forming these resolutions, I came to Milo's door, and, <lb/>
            as the saying is, entered hot-foott into the execution of my <lb/>
            project. However, I did not find either Milo or his wife at <lb/>
            home, but only my charmer Fotis, who was preparing sausages <lb/>
            for her master and mistress; she had some minced meat on <lb/>
            a platter, ready to mix with gravy, which, as my nostrils <lb/>
            augured, was very savoury.</p>
          <p>She was neatly dressed in a linen garment, gathered in by <lb/>
            a bright red sash, just below her breasts, and as she stirred the <lb/>
            saucepan round and round by a circular movement of her rosy <lb/>
            hand, her supple form partook in the motion, her loins vi­ <lb/>
            brated, and her flexible spine was thrown into charming un­ <lb/>
            dulations.</p>
          <p>Entranced by the sight, I stood gazing in admiration; all <lb/>
            my passions, which before lay dormant, were aroused. At <lb/>
            last I said to her, " With what a graceful, what a delightful <lb/>
            twist of your hips, you stir that saucepan, my Fotis ! what <lb/>
            honeyed dish are you preparing? Happy, and most surely <lb/>
            blessed is he, who is allowed by you to clip his finger therein."</p>
          <p>" Begone, unhappy wight," cried the sprightly chatter-box, <note type="footnote"> * Good luck be your speed then!]—' Quod bonum, felix et faustum.' This <lb/>
            formula, somewhat similar to our, ' I wish you health, happiness, and <lb/>

            of importance, and was supposed not only to avert an evil omen, but to <lb/>
            ensure a good one. </note><note type="footnote"> t Entered hot.foot.]-This is not the literal translation of the phrase <lb/>

            equally well how to provide a zest for bed and board." Thus <lb/>
            Baying, she looked at me and smiled.</p>
          <p>I did not leave her, however, till I had carefully surveyed <lb/>
            the whole contour of her person. But why speak of other <lb/>
            particulars ? since it has ever been my sole care, in the first <lb/>
            place, to scrutinize the head and the hair in public, and after­ <lb/>
            wards to enjoy their loveliness in private : and in this I pro­ <lb/>
            ceed upon sure and fixed principles, first, because these are the <lb/>
            most important features of the person, and from their conspi­ <lb/>
            cuous position, they are the first to present themselves to our <lb/>
            sight; and, secondly, because the natural brilliancy of the <lb/>
            hair effects for the head what the cheerful colour of a showy <lb/>
            garment effects for the other members of the body..</p>
          <p>Besides, most women, in order to display their native charms <lb/>
            and loveliness, divest themselves of all neck mufflings, throw <lb/>
            open their outer garments, and delight to show their naked <lb/>
            beauty; being conscious that they shall please more by the <lb/>
            roseate hue of their skin, than by the golden tints of their <lb/>
            robes. But, on the other hand, (I shudder to speak of such a <lb/>
            thing, and may there never be an instance of a catastrophe <lb/>
            so dreadful,) if you deprive the most surpassingly beautiful <lb/>
            woman of her hair, and thus strip her face of its native orna. <lb/>
            ments ; though she were begotten by heaven, conceived by the <lb/>
            sea, and nurtured amid the waves; though, I say, she were <lb/>
            Venus herself, surrounded by all the choir of the Graces, at­ <lb/>
            tended by a whole multitude of Cupids, girt with her cestus <lb/>
            redolent of cinnamon, and bedewed with balsams-still, if <lb/>
            she were bald, she would not find favour even in the eyes of <lb/>
            her own Vulcan.</p>
          <p>How exquisitely charming is hair of a beautiful hue and <lb/>
            rich lustre, when it flashes back the rays of the sun, or shines <lb/>
            with milder radiance, and varies its lovely aspect with every <lb/>
            change of light! now emitting a brightness like that of gold, <lb/>
            now shaded off into the softer hue of honey; raven-black at <lb/>
            one moment, at the next reflecting the myriad blossom tints <lb/>
            of the pigeon's neck; or, when anointed with Arabian drops,* <note type="footnote"> * Arabian drops.]-Myrrh or spikenard is probably meant. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="30"/>
            parted by the slender tooth of the comb, and gathered up be­ <lb/>
            hind the head, it presents itself to the eyes of the lover, and <lb/>
            like a mirror reflects his overjoyed features. How beautiful, <lb/>
            when its luxuriant mass is accumulated on the crown of the <lb/>
            head, or suffered. to flow down the back in profuse curls. Such, <lb/>
            in short, is the dignity of the hair, that though a woman <lb/>
            should go adorned with jewels of gold, rich garments, precious <lb/>
            stones, and every other kind of ornament, still she could not <lb/>
            possibly seem well dressed, unless she had duly arranged her <lb/>
            hair.</p>
          <p>But in.my Fotis, not studied artifice, but the neglect of orna­ <lb/>
            ment, added graces to her person. For her copious hair, thrown <lb/>
            loosely back and falling adown her neck, rested lightly on the <lb/>
            flexuous fringe of her garment; then, after being gradually <lb/>
            drawn together, the ends were looped up, and fastened by a <lb/>
            knot to the crown of her head. I could no longer sustain the <lb/>
            torturing suspense of such exquisite delight, but bending for­ <lb/>
            ward gave her a most luscious kiss, on that part where the hair <lb/>
            was drawn up to the top of the head.</p>
          <p>She looked at me over her shoulder, and her eyes lit into my <lb/>
            heart with their sidelong glances: " So then, you school-boy," <lb/>
            said she, " you have taken a sweet, and at the same time, a <lb/>
            bitter draught. Beware, lest the excessive sweetness of the <lb/>
            honey turn into the lasting bitterness of gall."</p>
          <p>" Why do you say so, my charmer ?" I replied, " since I am <lb/>
            ready to be laid at full length and roasted upon that fire, so my <lb/>
            pain be soothed by a single kiss." So saying, I clasped her in <lb/>
            my arms, and fell to kissing her.</p>
          <p>And now, with responsive desire waxing with mine into <lb/>
            an equality of love, exhaling from her open mouth the odour <lb/>
            of cinnamon, she ravished me with the nectareous touch of her <lb/>
            tongue, so that I exclaimed, " I shall perish, nay, rather, I am <lb/>
            a lost man already, unless you will be propitious."</p>
          <p>Smothering me with kisses, she replied, " Be of good cou­ <lb/>
            rage, for I am become your bondsmaid through mutual desire, <lb/>
            nor shall our delights be long deferred; but as soon as torches <lb/>
            are lighted, I will come to your chamber. Depart, then, and <lb/>
            hold yourself in readiness, for I will do battle with you all <lb/>
            night long, as bravely as heart can wish." After we had <lb/>
            prattled thus for some time, we parted.</p>
          <p>It was just about noon, when Byrrhæna sent me a com. <pb n="31"/>
            <note type="margin"> BOOK II. </note> <lb/>
            plimentary present,* consisting of a fat pig, two couple and a <lb/>
            half of fowls, and a jar of choice old wine. Calling Fotis, <lb/>
            " Look," said I, " Bacchus, the exciter and armour-bearer of <lb/>
            Venus, has come here of his own accord. Let us quaff all <lb/>
            this wine to-day, in order that it may extinguish in us all <lb/>
            bashful hesitation, and stimulate our lusty vigour. For the <lb/>
            voyage of Venus stands in need only of such provision as this: <lb/>
            that through the whole of the wakeful night, the lamp may <lb/>
            be plentifully supplied with oil, and the cup with wine."</p>
          <p>The rest of the day I passed in bathing, and at supper : for, <lb/>
            being invited by the worthy Milo, I took my place at his epi­ <lb/>
            tome of a table, as much as possible out of the view of his wife, ' <lb/>
            as I kept in mind the admonitions of Byrrhæna ; while every <lb/>
            now and then, I cast a trembling glance upon her features, as <lb/>
            if I was beholding the lake Avernus. ƚ But as I continually <lb/>
            followed Fotis, who waited on us, with my eyes, my feelings <lb/>
            were refreshed by looking at her.</p>
          <p>And now, as the evening had advanced, Pamphile, looking at <lb/>
            the lamp, remarked, "We shall have a terrible fall of rain to- <lb/>
            morrow."</p>
          <p>On her husband asking her how she know that to be the <lb/>
            case, she answered, that the lamp had predictedJ it to her. <lb/>
            At this speech, Milo, bursting into a laugh, exclaimed, " In <lb/>
            this lamp, we feed a mighty Sibyl, who looks down from the <lb/>
            socket, § as from a watch-tower, upon all that is going on in <lb/>
            the heavens, and even the sun himself."</p>
          <p>Mingling in the conversation, I said, " This is only a simple <lb/>
            instance of this kind of divination, and, indeed, it ought not <lb/>
            to seem wonderful, that this flame, small though it is, and <lb/>
            ignited by human hands, should still have a consciousness of <note type="footnote"> * A complimentary present.]-Xeniola. This was the name given to <lb/>

            tailed as if it was aopvoc, destitute of birds, because, by its foul exhala­ <lb/>

            Pluto, was thought to be the entrance to the realms beneath, and is fre­ <lb/>

            the greater and celestial fire, as of its parent, and should thus, <lb/>
            by divine presage, know and announce to us what the source <lb/>
            of its existence is about to effect in the summit of the firmament. <lb/>
            For with us, at Corinth, a certain Chaldean stranger is just now <lb/>
            disturbing the whole city with his wonderful replies to questions <lb/>
            asked him, and is disclosing the secrets of the Fates to the public <lb/>
            for payment. Thus, for instance, he would tell the day on which <lb/>
            a marriage should be contracted that was destined to last long, <lb/>
            or when the foundations of walls should be laid so as to re­ <lb/>
            main for ever; what day would be advantageous to the mer­ <lb/>
            chant ; or which one would be suited to the traveller, or adapted <lb/>
            for setting sail. In fine, when I consulted him as to what would <lb/>
            be the result of this journey of mine, he told me many things <lb/>
            of a very wonderful and an extremely varied nature. He said, <lb/>
            for instance, that I should shortly obtain a very considerable <lb/>
            renown, and that I should be the writer of an incredible story, <lb/>
            and of sundry books."</p>
          <p>" What was the appearance of this Chaldean?" said Milo, <lb/>
            with a smile, " and what was his name r"</p>
          <p>" He was a tall man," replied I, " of a dark complexion, <lb/>
            and his name was Diophanes."</p>
          <p>" It is the very same person," said Milo, " and no other, and <lb/>
            here also, among us, he made many similar predictions to vari­ <lb/>
            ous persons, and realized thereby no little wealth, indeed, I <lb/>
            may say, a considerable sum of money; but at last experienced <lb/>
            an inauspicious, or, to speak more truly, a cruel lot." *</p>

          <p>ONe day, when, encircled by a great crowd of people, he was <lb/>

            Cerdo by name, came to him, desirous to know what day would <lb/>
            be suitable for a journey. After Diophanes had named one, <lb/>
            Cerdo took out his purse, poured out the money, and counted <lb/>
            a hundred denars, which Diophanes was to receive as the price <note type="footnote"> * Inauspicious—cruel lot.]—He puns on the resemblance of the words <lb/>
            ' scæva ' and ' sæva; but the play on these words cannot be preserved <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> BOOK II. </note> <lb/>
            of his predictions, when a young man of a noble family, com­ <lb/>
            ing softly behind him, pulled him by the garment, and on his <lb/>
            turning round, embraced and kissed him in the most affectionate <lb/>
            manner.</p>
          <p>Diophanes having returned the embrace, desired the young <lb/>
            man to take a seat beside him, and, under the surprise of his <lb/>
            unexpected appearance, quite forgot the business with which <lb/>
            he was just then engaged.</p>
          <p>" How long is it," said he, "since you, whom I have so <lb/>
            much wished for, arrived in this neighbourhood ?"</p>
          <p>"I arrived early last evening," replied the other. But <lb/>
            tell me, brother, in your turn, how it happened that you sailed <lb/>
            so quickly from the island of Eubœa to this city, and how <lb/>
            you travelled hither by sea and land."</p>
          <p>Then, Diophanes, this egregious Chaldean, taken aback, and <lb/>
            not altogether himself, replied, " May our enemies and evil- <lb/>
            wishers meet with the like cruel, indeed, I may say, Ulyssean <lb/>
            peregrination. For the ship in which we sailed, being shat­ <lb/>
            tered by various storms and whirlwinds, after losing both mast <lb/>
            and rudder, was with the utmost difficulty brought to the verge <lb/>
            of the opposite shore, and went down, head foremost; and we, <lb/>
            having lost all our property, with difficulty saved our lives by <lb/>
            swimming. Whatever we could scrape together, either from <lb/>
            the pity of strangers, or the benevolence of our friends, a band <lb/>
            of robbers laid hands on the whole of it; and my only brother, <lb/>
            Arisuatus, resisting their violence, was murdered, poor fellow! <lb/>
            before these eyes."</p>
          <p>While Diophanes was dolefully relating these particulars, the <lb/>
            merchant Cerdo, snatching up the money he had paid as the <lb/>
            price of the prediction, instantly took to his heels. Then, in­ <lb/>
            deed, Diophanes at length aroused from his fit of abstraction, <lb/>
            perceived the blunder he had made, especially when he saw <lb/>
            all of us who stood around him burst into loud fits of laughter.</p>
          <p>END OF THE SECOND EPISODE.</p>
          <p>Nevertheless, master Lucius, I sincerely wish that the <lb/>
            Chaldean may have predicted the truth to you if to no one <lb/>
            else, and that you may be fortunate, and make a prosperous <lb/>
            journey."</p>
          <p>While Milo was thus prosing on at interminable length, I <note type="footnote"> D </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="34"/>
            groaned inwardly, and was not a little vexed with myself for <lb/>
            having voluntarily introduced a series of wearisome stories, <lb/>
            and thus losing a good part of the evening, and its delightful <lb/>
            enjoyments. At length, therefore, gulping down all my bash­ <lb/>
            fulness, I said to Milo, "Let Diophanes carry his destiny with <lb/>
            him, and again expose the plunder of the public to land and <lb/>
            sea. But permit me, who am still sore from the fatigues of <lb/>
            yesterday, to retire early to rest."</p>
          <p>So saying, I rose up and betook myself to my bedchamber; <lb/>
            and there I found a very nice assortment of good cheer. <lb/>
            The bed of the servant boys was laid on the floor, at a con­ <lb/>
            siderable distance outside the door; in order, I suppose, that <lb/>
            they might not be within hearing of our chatter in the night. <lb/>
            Close by my bed stood a small table, laden with the choice <lb/>
            remains of the whole supper, and some fair cups already <lb/>
            half filled with- wine, only waiting for the admixture of water. <lb/>
            Near these, also, was a flagon, with a gradually dilated orifice, <lb/>
            for the more convenient pouring forth of the wine; the whole <lb/>
            being a whet, as it were, for what was to follow.</p>
          <p>I had scarcely laid me down, when, behold! my Fotis (her <lb/>
            mistress having now retired to rest) came in throwing a gar­ <lb/>
            land of roses upon the bed, and wearing a single rose in full <lb/>
            bloom in her bosom. After pressing me close and kissing me, <lb/>
            tying a garland round my head, and strewing flowers upon me, <lb/>
            she took up a cup, and pouring warm water into it, handed <lb/>
            it to me that I might drink a little. Before I had drunk <lb/>
            the whole, she gently took it from me, and gradually di­ <lb/>
            minishing with her lips what was left, sipped it sweetly, with <lb/>
            her eyes fixed on me all the while. Again and again we <lb/>
            pledged each other; until at last, flushed with wine, turbulent <lb/>
            in mind and body, and tingling and smarting with desire, I <lb/>
            gave my Fotis ocular proof of my amorous impatience:</p>
          <p>" Pity me," I said, u and relieve me without delay; for you <lb/>
            may perceive how I have been kept on full stretch by the <lb/>
            thought of that combat to which you challenged me without <lb/>
            the intervention of a herald. Ever since I received the first <lb/>
            of cruel Cupid's arrows in my vitals, I have been standing to <lb/>
            my arms, and I am greatly afraid my bow-string will be <lb/>
            snapped by its excessive tension. But if you would gratify <lb/>
            me still more, untie your hair, let it flow freely over your <lb/>
            shoulders, and come and give me loving kisses."</p><pb n="35"/>
            
          <p><note type="margin">BOOK II. </note> In an instant she had snatched away all the eating and 1 <lb/>
            drinking apparatus; then, stripping off all her garments, with <lb/>
            her hair dishevelled in joyous wantonness, she stood trans­ <lb/>

            so we passed the sleepless night until dawn, refreshing our­ <lb/>
            selves at intervals with wine, and rekindling our ardour for <lb/>
            the pleasant strife. In like manner we passed many other <lb/>

            </p>
          <p>It happened one day that Byrrhæna pressingly invited me <lb/>
            to sup with her; and though I made many excuses, she would <lb/>
            not let me off. I, therefore, had to resort to Fotis, and take <lb/>
            counsel from her, as from an oracle; and though unwilling <lb/>
            that I should depart from her the breadth of a nail, yet she <lb/>
            kindly indulged me with a little respite from our amatory <lb/>
            warfare.</p>
          <p>" But, look you," said she, " take care that you return early <lb/>
            from this supper, for a frantic faction of the young nobles has <lb/>
            been disturbing the public tranquillity, and you will see mur­ <lb/>
            dered men lying here and there in the streets; nor can the <lb/>
            forces of the prefect of the province, in consequence of the re­ <lb/>
            moteness of their stations, relieve the city from these outrages. <lb/>
            Now, your superior fortune, and contempt for you, as a foreigner, <lb/>
            may possibly cause you to be waylaid."</p>
          <p>"Do not be under any apprehensions, my Fotis," said I; <lb/>
            for besides that I prefer my own pleasures to the banquets of <lb/>
            others, I will return early, in order to remove these fears of <lb/>
            yours. However, I shall not go unattended; for girded with <lb/>
            my trusty sword, I shall carry a protector of my safety."</p>
          <p>Thus equipped I proceeded to the entertainment. There was <lb/>
            a numerous assembly of guests, and as Byrrhæna was a woman <lb/>
            of rank, it comprised some of the first-rate people of the city. <lb/>
            The repast was sumptuous; the couches, framed with polished <lb/>
            ivory, were covered with cloth of gold; the cups were ca­ <lb/>
            pacious, of various graceful designs, and all unique in value. <lb/>
            Some were of glass, with figures exquisitely embossed: others of <lb/>
            the purest crystal; others, again, of burnished silver, or of <note type="footnote"> dirige, et grassare naviter, et occide moriturus. Hodierna <lb/>

            glittering gold, or of amber, admirably wrought and hollowed <lb/>
            out into beakers. In short, whatever one thought impossible <lb/>
            to be made by man, was there.</p>
          <p>The carvers* were numerous, and their dresses splendid; <lb/>
            the dishes were abundant, damsels waited gracefully at table, <lb/>
            while youths with curled locks, and beautifully attired, ever <lb/>
            and anon handed to the guests old wine in cups of precious <lb/>
            stone.</p>
          <p>And now, lights being brought in, the conversation gradually <lb/>
            became more convivial; there was abundance of laughter, and <lb/>
            good-humoured quips and jokes flew about in every direction, <lb/>
            when Byrrhæna thus addressed me : " How do you enjoy your­ <lb/>
            self in this country of ours ? If I am not mistaken, we greatly <lb/>
            excel all other cities in temples, baths, and other public works. <lb/>
            And then we have an extraordinary abundance of all the commo­ <lb/>
            dities of life. Beyond a doubt here one enjoys full liberty, and <lb/>
            may live at his ease ; for the stranger who is a man of busi­ <lb/>
            ness, there is all the bustle of Rome, while for the new-comer <lb/>
            who is of retiring habits, the quiet of a country-house is here <lb/>
            to be found. In fine, our city is a place of resort for all the plea­ <lb/>
            sure-seekers of this province."</p>
          <p>" What you say is quite true," I replied, " and no where <lb/>
            have I felt myself more perfectly at liberty than I am here. <lb/>
            But I am sadly frightened at the dark mysteries and irresis­ <lb/>
            tible spells of the magic art. For it is said, that here not <lb/>
            even the sepulchres of the dead are unmolested, but that <lb/>
            certain remnants and cuttings from the dead bodies are sought <lb/>
            from the tombs and funeral-piles, to ensure deadly misfortune <lb/>
            to the living. I am told also that when foreigners are buried, <lb/>
            old hags of sorceresses are in the habit of outstripping the <lb/>
            funeral procession, in their speed to ravage the corpse."</p>
          <p>"No doubt of it," observed one of the guests; "and what <lb/>
            is more, in this place they do not even spare the living. There <lb/>
            is a certain person—I don't name him—who suffered from an <lb/>
            attack of this nature, and whose face was mutilated and de­ <lb/>
            formed in all manner of ways."</p>
          <p>At these remarks, an uncontrollable fit of laughter burst <lb/>
            forth from all the guests, and the faces and eyes of all were <note type="footnote"> * The carvers.]—' Diribitores.' It was probably the duty of these <lb/>
            servants to carry round the viands and distribute them among the guests. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="38"/>
            turned towards a person who sat in a corner, apart from the <lb/>
            rest of the company. This person, confused by the long-con­ <lb/>
            tinued merriment, and indignantly muttering between his teeth, <lb/>
            was preparing to rise and leave the room, when Byrrhæna ad­ <lb/>
            dressed him, and said, " Nay, my good Telephron, do not go, <lb/>
            but stop a little while, and with your usual good humour, do <lb/>
            tell us that adventure of yours over again, that my son, Lucius, <lb/>
            here, may also enjoy the pleasure of hearing your entertaining <lb/>
            story."</p>
          <p>To this the other replied, "You, indeed, madam, always <lb/>
            preserve a scrupulous regard for good breeding, but the inso­ <lb/>
            lence of some people is such as not to be tolerated."</p>
          <p>These words were pronounced by him in a tone of great ex­ <lb/>
            citement. Byrrhæna, however, reiterated her request, and <lb/>
            conjuring him as he valued her life to tell the story, forced <lb/>
            him at last to comply, whether he liked or not. Accordingly, <lb/>
            gathering up the coverings of the couch in a heap, resting his <lb/>
            elbow thereon, and raising his body a little on the couch, he <lb/>
            extended his right hand and arranged his fingers after the <lb/>
            manner of our orators, closing the last two, and pointing the <lb/>
            rest straight forward, with the thumb upturned.* Then, with <lb/>
            a courteous smile, he began as follows :—</p>

            As the money I had brought with me for my journey had been <lb/>

            making proclamation in a loud voice : ' If any one will under. <lb/>
            take to guard the body of a dead man, he shall be well rewarded <lb/>
            for his services.'</p>
          <p>" On this, I said to one of the bystanders, 'What am I to <lb/>
            understand by this ? Are the dead in the habit of running <lb/>
            away in this country ?'</p>
          <p>" 1 Hold your tongue,' replied he, ' for you are a boy, and a <lb/>
            green one too, and a foreigner all over, not to know that you <lb/>
            are in Thessaly, where it is a universal practice with witches <lb/>
            to tear off pieces from the faces of the dead with their teeth, <lb/>
            in order to use them as ingredients in the magic art.'</p>
          <p>" ' Pray, tell me,' said I, ' in what does this funeral war­ <lb/>
            denship consist ?'</p>
          <p>, " ' In the first place,' he replied, 'you must watch inces­ <lb/>
            santly the livelong night, with eyes fixed steadily on the corpse, <lb/>
            wide open and not indulging in a wink ; nor must your gaze <lb/>
            ever be turned away to the one side or the other, no, not even <lb/>
            may you cast a glance aside it. For these most abominable <lb/>
            shifters of their skins, changing, in appearance, into any ani­ <lb/>
            mal they please, creep upon you unawares, so that they can <lb/>
            easily elude the very eyes of Justice and of the Sun. For they <lb/>
            assume the forms of birds, dogs, mice, ay, and even of flies; <lb/>
            and thus disguised, they exert their dire incantations, and <lb/>
            overwhelm the guardians with sleep. Nor can any person <lb/>
            sufficiently describe the extent of the devices which they make <lb/>
            use of, for the sake of gratifying their libidinous appetite. <lb/>
            And yet, after all, no larger pay than four or six pieces of <lb/>
            gold is offered as the reward of such a dangerous service as <lb/>
            this. But stop; there is one thing I had almost forgotten : <lb/>
            if the person who watches does not on the following morning <lb/>
            give up possession of the dead body in an entire state, he is <lb/>
            compelled to make good the whole of it with strips cut from <lb/>
            his own face, to match whatever has been torn off from that of <lb/>
            the corpse.'</p>
          <p>IOn learning these facts, I summoned up all my courage, and <lb/>
            going straightway to the crier, ' Cease from making proclama- <note type="footnote"> * Standing on a stone.]—We learn from the Bacchides of Plautus and <lb/>

            what is to be the reward.'</p>
          <p>" ' A thousand pieces of money will be paid you,' said he. <lb/>
            ' But look, young man, you must be very careful to preserve <lb/>
            the dead body, which is that of the son of one of the principal <lb/>
            persons of this city, from the abominable Harpies.'</p>
          <p>"'You are talking nonsense to me,' said I, 'and mere <lb/>
            trifles. You behold in me a man of iron nerve, proof against <lb/>
            sleep, and, beyond a doubt, more sharp-sighted than Lynceus <lb/>
            himself, or Argus; in fact, one who is eyes all over.'</p>
          <p>"I had no sooner said this, than he at once led me to a <lb/>
            certain house, the main entrance of which being closed, he in­ <lb/>
            troduced me through a low back door, and into a darkened <lb/>
            bedchamber, with closed window shutters, where there was a <lb/>
            Lady dressed in black garments, and weeping. Going up to her, <lb/>
            the crier said, ' This person has agreed to your terms, and <lb/>
            confidently undertakes to watch the body of your husband.'</p>
          <p>" On this, the lady, throwing back on each side the hair that <lb/>
            hung down over her face, which even in grief was beautiful, <lb/>
            and turning towards me, said, ' Take care, I beg of you, to <lb/>
            perform vigilantly the duty which you have undertaken.'</p>
          <p>" ' Never fear,' said I, ' only have in readiness something <lb/>
            to throw into the bargain as a present.'</p>
          <p>" Assenting to this request, she hastily arose, and bade me fol­ <lb/>
            low her into another bedchamber. There, in the presence of <lb/>
            seven witnesses who had been introduced into the room, she <lb/>
            pointed with her hand to a dead body that was covered with <lb/>
            a linen cloth of the purest white; and having wept for a con­ <lb/>
            siderable time at the sight of it, she called upon those present <lb/>
            to bear testimony, and carefully pointed out to them every par­ <lb/>
            ticular ; while a person made notes on tablets of the parts of <lb/>
            the body, which were severally touched for that purpose.</p>
          <p>" ' Behold,' said she, ' the nose entire, the eyes in a sound <lb/>
            condition, the ears safe, the lips untouched, and the chin per­ <lb/>
            fect. Do you, worthy citizens,* bear testimony to this.' <lb/>
            Having thus said, and the tablets duly signed and sealed, she <lb/>
            was departing, when I said to her,</p>

            you think you have come hither for the purpose of eating and <lb/>
            drinking ? Rather betake yourself to sorrow and tears, as best <lb/>
            suited to this place.' Then turning to her maid-servant, she <lb/>
            said, ' Myrrhina, give him the lamp and oil directly,' and so <lb/>
            saying, she went out, and left the guardian shut up in the bed- <lb/>
            chamber.</p>
          <p>" Being thus left alone to comfort the corpse, I rubbed my <lb/>
            eyes, to fortify them for their duty of watchfulness, and kept <lb/>
            up my spirits by singing. And now behold twilight came on, <lb/>
            night fell, then night deeper and deeper still, and at last the <lb/>
            hour of midnight; then, of a truth, my fears, that had some <lb/>
            time been increasing, became redoubled. All of a sudden a <lb/>
            weasel, creeping into the apartment, stopped close before me, <lb/>
            and fixed its eyes most intently upon me, so much so, that the <lb/>
            little creature quite agitated my mind by its unusual conn- <lb/>
            dence. At length, however, I said to it: ' Out with you, <lb/>
            nasty little beast! and go hide yourself to the mice that are <lb/>
            just like you, before you get a knock-down blow from me. Be <lb/>
            off with you, I say !'</p>
          <p>" The animal turned tail, and immediately ran out of the <lb/>
            chamber : and at the very instant a profound sleep suddenly <lb/>
            seized and engulphed me ; so that not even the God of Delphi <lb/>
            himself could have easily determined which of us two, who <lb/>
            there lay prostrate, was the more dead. In fact, I was so in­ <lb/>
            sensible, and so much in need of some one else to take care of <lb/>
            me, that I might just as well have not been there at all.</p>
          <p>" Hardly had the clarion of the crested cohort sounded a <lb/>
            truce to the night, when I, at length aroused, and terrified in <lb/>
            the extreme, ran up to the dead body ; holding the light to it, <lb/>
            and uncovering its face, I scrutinized every feature, and found <lb/>
            everything in proper order. Presently, the poor widow burst <lb/>
            into the room in tears and great distress, with the witnesses <lb/>
            of yesterday ; and, immediately throwing herself on the body, <lb/>
            and kissing it again and again, she began to examine it all <lb/>
            over, with the assistance of the lamp. Then turning, she called <lb/>
             <pb n="42"/>
            Philodespotus,* the steward of her house, and ordered him, <lb/>
            without delay, to pay the promised reward to one who had <lb/>
            acted as so good a guardian.</p>
          <p>" This being given me without delay, "We thank you sin­ <lb/>
            cerely, young man,' said she, ' and, by Hercules! for having <lb/>
            so well performed this service, we will henceforth enrol you <lb/>
            among the rest of our household:</p>
          <p>" Overjoyed at this unlooked-for piece of good fortune, and en­ <lb/>
            chanted at the sight of the glittering pieces of gold, which every <lb/>
            now and then I shook up and down in my hand, ' By all <lb/>
            means, madam,' said I, ' consider me one of your servants; <lb/>
            and, as often as you stand in need of my services, you may <lb/>
            confidently command me.'</p>
          <p>" Hardly had I thus spoken, when all the servants, heaping <lb/>
            curses upon the dreadful ominousnesst of my words, snatched <lb/>
            up whatever came to hand, and fell upon me. One began to <lb/>
            strike me in the face with his fist, another to dig me in the <lb/>
            back and ribs with his elbows, a third to kick me with his <lb/>
            feet, a fourth to pull out my hair, a fifth to tear my clothes. <lb/>
            Thus, mauled and mangled almost as badly as was Adonis or <lb/>
            Orpheus, J I was thrust out of doors.</p>
          <p>" I stopped to recover myself in the next street, and reflect­ <lb/>
            ing too late on my inauspicious and imprudent remark, I could <lb/>
            not but acknowledge that I had fully deserved to suffer even <lb/>
            still more blows than I had received. By and by the dead <lb/>
            person was carried out, accompanied, for the last time, by <lb/>
            lamentations and outcries; and, according to the custom of the <lb/>
            country, was borne with all the pomp of a public funeral, as <lb/>
            being one of the principal men, through the forum. To the <lb/>
            side of the corpse there runs up an old man, bathed with <note type="footnote"> * Philodespotus.]—A name, composed of the two Greek words <foreign xml:lang="grc">Φιλὸς</foreign> <lb/>
            and <foreign xml:lang="grc">δέσπότης</foreign>, and signifying one who willingly submits to the domination <lb/>

            tears, and tearing his venerable white hair; and then, seizing <lb/>
            the bier with both his hands, and with a voice raised to the <lb/>
            highest pitch, though interrupted with frequent sobs, 1 0 <lb/>
            Romans,' exclaimed he, ' by your faith, and by the public <lb/>
            morality, espcase the cause of your murdered fellow-citizen, <lb/>
            and wreak your severe vengeance on this abominable and <lb/>
            wicked woman, for her most atrocious crime; for she, and <lb/>
            no one else, has cut off by poison this unfortunate young man, <lb/>
            my sister's son, for the sake of her paramour, and made a prey <lb/>
            of the inheritance.'</p>
          <p>" After this manner, the old man loudly uttered complaints <lb/>
            and lamentations, broken by his sobs. In the meantime, the <lb/>
            people began to express their indignation, being impelled to a <lb/>
            belief in the charge, on the grounds of its probability alone. <lb/>
            They shouted for fire; for stones ; they incited the boys to the <lb/>
            destruction of the woman; but she, pretending to shed tears, <lb/>
            and adjuring all the Divinities, denied most solemnly that she <lb/>
            had perpetrated a crime of such great enormity.</p>
          <p>" , Well then,' said the old man, ' let us refer the decision <lb/>
            of the truth to divine providence. Here is Zachlas, the Egyptian, <lb/>
            a first-rate prophet, it who has already agreed with me, for a <lb/>
            considerable sum, to recall the soul for a few moments from <lb/>
            the realms beneath, to reanimate this body.' Thus saying, he <lb/>
            brought forward into the midst of the people a young man, <lb/>
            clothed in linen garments,† with his head close shaven, and <lb/>
            having on his feet sandals made of palm leaves. ‡ After <lb/>
            having for some time kissed his hands and embraced his very <lb/>
            knees, 1 0 priest,' said he, ' take pity on me, by the stars <lb/>

            philosophers, are said to have associated with them. </note><note type="footnote"> t Linen garments.]—See book xi., where the linen garments of the <lb/>
            priests of Isis are more copiously mentioned. Woollen garments were, <lb/>
            according to the doctrine of Orpheus and Pythagoras, profane; but those <lb/>
            of linen were considered as most pure. </note><note type="footnote"> ‡ Sandals made of palm leaves.]—' Baxæ,' or ' Baxeae,' were sandals <lb/>
            with wooden soles, made of twigs of fibres. They were worn on the stage <lb/>
            by comic actors, and philosophers much affected the use of them. The <lb/>
            Egyptians made them of palm leaves or the papyrus. </note> <lb/>

            closures,* by the overflowing of the Nile, by the mysteries of <lb/>
            the Memphis, and by the sistrum of Pharos, I implore you. <lb/>
            Give to this dead body a short enjoyment of the sun, and infuse <lb/>
            a portion of light into eyes that have been buried in eternal <lb/>
            night. We are not offering resistance to fate, nor do we deny <lb/>
            to the earth what is her property; but we only request a short <lb/>
            space of life, that we may have the consolation of avenging <lb/>
            her death!</p>
          <p>" The prophet being thus propitiated, laid a certain herb <lb/>
            three times on the mouth of the corpse, and placed another <lb/>
            on its breast. He then turned towards the east, and silently <lb/>
            prayed to the rising disk of the glorious Sun, whilst an intense <lb/>
            interest was excited among the byestanders, by the sight of <lb/>
            such awful preparations, and the prospect of a miracle. I <lb/>
            mingled with the crowd, and standing on an elevated stone, <lb/>
            close behind the bier, observed every thing with inquisitive <lb/>
            eyes.</p>
          <p>" Presently the breast of the corpse began to be inflated, the <lb/>
            artery to throb with pulsation, the body to be filled with breath; <lb/>
            at last the corpse arose, and thus addressed the young man: <lb/>
            t Why, I beseech thee, dost thou bring me back to the duties of <lb/>
            a momentary existence, after having drunk of the Lethæan cup, <lb/>
            and floated upon the Stygian lake ? Cease, I beseech thee, <lb/>
            cease and leave me to my repose.' These were the words heard <lb/>
            to proceed from the body.</p>
          <p>" On this, the prophet, becoming still more excited, exclaimed, <lb/>
            ' Why dost thou not relate to this crowd each particular, and <lb/>
            disclose the mysteries of thy death ? Knowest thou not that the <lb/>
            Furies can be summoned by my imprecations to rack thy wearied <lb/>
            limbs ?'</p>
          <p>" The body looked up from the bier, and with a deep groan <lb/>
            thus addressed the people: ' Cut off through the nefarious arts <lb/>
            of my newly-married wife, and by a poisonous draught, I have <lb/>
            yielded my yet warm bed to her paramour.'</p>
          <p>" Then that choice specimen of a wife, arming herself with <lb/>
            audacity, began to contradict the accusation of her husband in <lb/>
            a wrangling and sacrilegious manner. The excited mob took <note type="footnote"> * The Coptic enclosures.]—This probably alludes to certain embank. <lb/>
            ments which were said to be thrown up annually by swallows around an <lb/>
            island near Coptos, which was sacred to Isis. They were said to labour <lb/>
            so hard in thus attempting to preserve the island from the overflowing <lb/>
            of the Nile, that numbers died at the work. </note> <pb n="45"/>
            <note type="margin"> BOOK II. </note> <lb/>
            different sides; one party contended that this most iniquitous <lb/>
            woman should be immediately buried alive, with the corpse of <lb/>
            her husband ; the other declared that credit ought not to be <lb/>
            given to the lying testimony of the dead body. The subsequent <lb/>
            disclosures, however, of the young man put an end to this dis­ <lb/>
            pute ; for, again heaving a deep groan, ' I will give you,' he <lb/>
            said, ' I will give you incontrovertible evidence of the truth <lb/>
            of my statements, and will disclose to you what is known to <lb/>
            no other person whatever.'</p>
          <p>" Then, pointing to me with his finger : ' When that most <lb/>
            sagacious guardian of my body,' said he, ' was diligently keep­ <lb/>
            ing watch over me, the hags of sorceresses who eagerly hovered <lb/>
            over my mortal spoils, and who, to gain possession thereof, had <lb/>
            often changed themselves in vain into other forms, on finding <lb/>
            that they could not deceive his unwearied vigilance, at length <lb/>
            threw over him a cloud of drowsiness, and buried him in a <lb/>
            profound sleep; after which, they did not cease to call upon <lb/>
            me by my name, till my weakened joints and chilled limbs strug­ <lb/>
            gled, with convulsive efforts, to obey the mandates of the magic <lb/>
            art. Then this person, who though alive was still. dead, so <lb/>
            far as sleep goes, happening to be of the same name as myself, <lb/>
            unconsciously arose on hearing his name called, and spontane­ <lb/>
            ously walking just like an inanimate shadow, suffered the in­ <lb/>
            tended mutilation instead of myself; for although the doors of <lb/>
            the bedchamber were carefully bolted, the witches entered <lb/>
            through a chink, and cut off his nose first, and then his ears. <lb/>
            And, that the rest of the transaction might correspond with <lb/>
            their artful doings, they with the greatest exactness fitted on <lb/>
            to him wax, fashioned in imitation of his ears that had been <lb/>
            cut off, and provided him with a nose of the same substance, <lb/>
            just like his own. And here now stands the unfortunate <lb/>
            wretch who has obtained the reward dearly earned, not by his <lb/>
            vigilance, but by his sore mutilation.'</p>
          <p>" Exceedingly terrified on hearing this, I began to test my <lb/>
            fortune. Clapping my hand to my nose, I took hold of <lb/>
            it, and off it came: I touched my ears, and they fell to the <lb/>
            ground. Meanwhile the spectators pointed their fingers at <lb/>
            me, nodded their heads, and greeted me with loud roars of <lb/>
            laughter, until streaming with cold perspiration I dashed <lb/>
            through the surrounding crowd, and effected my escape. Nor, <lb/>
            thus mutilated and an object of ridicule, could I return to my <lb/>
             <pb n="46"/>
            native place; * but, with my hair falling on each side of my <lb/>
            lace, I concealed the wounds of my ears, and decently covered <lb/>
            the disgrace of my nose with this linen cloth, closely applied <lb/>
            to it by means of glue."</p>
          <p>END OF THE THIRD EPISODE.</p>
          <p>As soon as Telephron had ended this story, the guests, elated <lb/>
            with wine, again renewed their bursts of laughter. While <lb/>
            they were proposing his health, t Byrrhaena thus addressed <lb/>
            me : " To-morrow is a day which it has been usual to cele­ <lb/>
            brate from the earliest infancy and very foundation of this city, <lb/>
            a day on which we exclusively, among mankind, propitiate the <lb/>
            most sacred God of Laughter,J with ceremonies of joviality <lb/>
            and mirth. Your presence will render the festival still more <lb/>
            pleasing to us; and I wish that with your native wit, you <lb/>
            would devise something of a right joyous nature in honour <lb/>
            of the God, in order that we may the more becomingly and <lb/>
            abundantly shew our veneration for so great a Divinity."</p>
          <p>" Very well," said I; " what you request shall be done. And, <lb/>
            by Hercules ! I wish I may invent some piece of merriment <lb/>
            with which a god so mighty may be becomingly graced."</p>
          <p>By this time, having had my fill of wine, and being warned <lb/>
            by my servant it was now night, I immediately arose, and <lb/>
            having hastily bid farewell to Byrrhæna, took my way home­ <lb/>
            ward, with unsteady steps. But while we were going through <lb/>
            the first street, the light upon which we relied was extin- <note type="footnote"> * My native place.]—Miletus. </note><note type="footnote"> t Proposing his health.]—' Bibere salutaria' is the reading which has <lb/>
            been adopted. </note><note type="footnote"> ‡ God of Laughter.] Pausanias mentions this solemnity, where he <lb/>
            speaks of the Hypatensians. Plutarch also, in his life of Cleomenes, men­ <lb/>
            tions a temple which was dedicated to the God of Laughter; and he like­ <lb/>
            wise relates that a statue was erected to this divinity by Lycurgus. Every <lb/>
            providential energy of deity, about a sensible nature, was said, by ancient <lb/>
            theologists and philosophers, to be the sport of divinity. Hence the ancient <lb/>
            authors of fables call this peculiarity of the providence of the Gods, ener­ <lb/>
            gising about the world, laughter. So that, as Proclus well observes, (in <lb/>
            Plat. Polit.) we must define the laughter of the Gods to be their exube­ <lb/>
            rant energy in the universe, and the cause of the gladness of all mundane <lb/>
            natures. And, as this energy is never-failing, the laughter of the Gods <lb/>
            is very properly said by Ilomer to be unextinguished. The source, <lb/>

            guished by a sudden gust of wind; so that, with difficulty <lb/>
            groping our way through the darkness of the night against <lb/>
            which we were so badly provided, and continually knocking our <lb/>
            toes against the stones, we were quite wearied before we arrived <lb/>
            at home.</p>
          <p>When we had now entered our own street, lo and behold, <lb/>
            three men, of lusty and stout appearance, were pushing with all <lb/>
            their might against our door, and were not in the smallest <lb/>
            degree alarmed at our coming up; on the contrary, they kicked <lb/>
            at it more and more repeatedly with all their might, so that <lb/>
            to us, and to myself especially, they appeared unquestionably <lb/>
            to be robbers, and of the most desperate character. Accord­ <lb/>
            ingly, I instantly drew forth my sword, which I carried with <lb/>
            me concealed under my cloak against such an emergency. <lb/>
            Without delay I rushed into the midst of the robbers., and <lb/>
            plunged my sword to the hilt into the body of each, as I en­ <lb/>
            gaged with him in combat, till at length, pierced with many <lb/>
            and deadly wounds, they breathed their last before my very feet.</p>
          <p>Awakened by the tumult of this combat, Fotis came and <lb/>
            opened the door. I crawled into the house, panting for breath <lb/>
            and bathed in perspiration, and immediately threw myself on <lb/>
            my bed and fell asleep, as much fatigued with the slaughter of <lb/>
            these sturdy robbers, as if I had killed Geryon.*</p>

            her purple-caparisoned steeds through the heavens; and de­ <lb/>
            parting night surrendering me up to day, roused me from placid <lb/>
            slumbers. Compunction then seized my mind at the recollec­ <lb/>
            tion of the deed I had perpetrated on the previous evening. <lb/>
            Gathering my feet beneath me, locking my fingers upon my <lb/>
            knees, and so sitting up in bed on my haunches, I wept <lb/>
            abundantly; picturing to myself, in imagination, now the <lb/>
            Forum and the trial, now the condemnation, and lastly, the <lb/>
            executioner himself.</p>
          <p>" Shall I," said I to myself, " shall I meet with any judge <lb/>
            so mild and so considerate as to be able to pronounce me inno­ <lb/>
            cent,, when here I am, imbrued with the blood of a threefold <lb/>
            homicide, and reeking with the gore of so many citizens ? Is <lb/>
            this the journey so glorious in its results which Diophanes, <lb/>
            the Chaldaean, so confidently predicted for me ?" While with <lb/>
            such reflections ever and anon crossing my mind, I deplored my <lb/>
            evil fortune, a violent knocking at the door, and shouting was <lb/>
            heard at the gate: without more ado, it was thrown open, and <lb/>
            a great multitude rushing into the house, every part of it was <lb/>
            filled with the magistrates and their officers, and a miscel­ <lb/>
            laneous gathering of people. Instantly two of the lictors, <lb/>
            laying hands upon me, by order of the magistrates, began to <lb/>
            drag me along, whilst I offered no resistance. When we had <lb/>
            got to the end of the lane,* we were immediately met by such <lb/>
            an astonishing multitude, that it seemed as if the whole city <lb/>
            was pouring forth. And though I walked sorrowfully along, <lb/>
            with my head bowed down towards the ground, or rather, I <lb/>
            may say, to the shades below, yet, on casting a glance aside, I <lb/>
            saw a thing which caused me the greatest surprise. For among <lb/>
            the many thousands of people that surrounded me, there was <lb/>
            not a single one who was not ready to split his sides with <lb/>
            laughter.</p>
          <p>At length, having passed through all the principal streets, <lb/>
            and turning corner after corner, like the victim of a lustral sa­ <lb/>
            crifice, led all round the city before it is slain, to expiate the <lb/>
            anger of the Gods, I was marched into the Forum, and placed <lb/>
            before the judgment seat. And now, the magistrates being <lb/>
            seated on an elevated platform, the public crier proclaimed <note type="footnote"> * End of the lane.]— The' ' angiportus' here mentioned was probably <lb/>
            the lane or blind alley into which the door of the house opened. </note> <pb n="49"/>
            <note type="margin"> BOOK III. </note> <lb/>
            silence, when suddenly the people, with one unanimous voice, <lb/>
            requested that, in consequence of the multitude of spectators, <lb/>
            whose lives were in peril from the enormous pressure, this im­ <lb/>
            portant trial might take place in the theatre. Forthwith the <lb/>
            Forum was evacuated in every direction, the people filled every <lb/>
            seat in the body of the theatre* with extraordinary celerity; and <lb/>
            in the very entrances also, and over the whole of the roof, they <lb/>
            crowded as thick as they could stand. Great numbers clung to <lb/>
            the columns; some hung on to the statues; others were only <lb/>
            half visible through windows and between the beams of the <lb/>
            ceiling; and all, in their ardent desire to witness the sight, paid <lb/>
            no attention whatever to their own safety.</p>
          <p>The public officers now led me through the proscenium, t <lb/>
            just like some victim, and placed me in the midst of the <lb/>
            orchestra. The accuser being again summoned by the loud <lb/>
            bellowing of the crier, arose, and after water had been poured <lb/>
            into a certain vessel, ‡ which was finely perforated like a cullen­ <lb/>
            der, and through which it flowed drop by drop, for the purpose <lb/>
            of regulating the time for speaking, he thus addressed the <lb/>
            people:</p>
          <p>" A case is now brought before you, most worthy fellow- <lb/>
            citizens, which is of no trifling magnitude, but one which es­ <lb/>
            pecially regards the peace of the whole city, and is likely to <lb/>
            prove a momentous example, profitable to future ages. Where­ <lb/>
            fore, it is the more requisite that each and all of you should <lb/>
            have due regard for the public dignity, that so this nefarious <lb/>
            homicide, who has murdered so many citizens, may not go un­ <lb/>
            punished, for having thus cruelly butchered them. And do <lb/>
            not suppose that I am actuated by any private grudge, or <lb/>
            moved by personal animosity, in making this charge against <note type="footnote"> * Body of the theatre.]—' Caveæ conseptum.' The ' cavea' was the <lb/>
            part of the theatre in which the spectators sat. The ' cavea' at Rome <lb/>
            was threefold. In the lowest part sat the ' Equites' and Senators ; in the <lb/>
            uppermost, the lowest of the people; and in the middle, the more respec­ <lb/>
            table classes. </note><note type="footnote"> t The proscenium.]— The' ' proscenium' was the elevated part in front of <lb/>

            scribes it as being a hollow globe, having a neck at the upper part like that <lb/>
            of a bottle, through which the water was poured into it. </note> <note type="footnote"> E </note> <lb/>

            him. For I am the prefect of the night-watch : and I fully <lb/>
            believe there is not one person who can impeach my vigil­ <lb/>
            ance and attention. Accordingly, I will faithfully relate the <lb/>
            exact circumstances, and the transactions that took place last <lb/>
            night.</p>
          <p>" When about the third watch, * I had nearly gone my rounds <lb/>
            of the whole city, and had examined every corner from door to <lb/>
            door with scrupulous attention, I perceived this most blood- <lb/>
            thirsty young man laying about him on every side, and slaugh­ <lb/>
            tering with his drawn sword ; and I saw that three persons, <lb/>
            who had just fallen victims to his rage, were laid at his feet, <lb/>
            still breathing, and their bodies palpitating amid streams of <lb/>
            gore. Then, conscience-stricken, and with good reason, at the <lb/>
            commission of such a heinous deed, he immediately took to <lb/>
            flight, and having, through the protection of the darkness, es­ <lb/>
            caped into a certain house, he there lay concealed the whole <lb/>
            night. By the providence of the gods, however, which <lb/>
            allows no crime to pass unpunished, I took care to arrest him <lb/>
            in the morning, and bring him hither for the most august <lb/>
            judgment of your venerable tribunal, before he could make his <lb/>
            escape clandestinely. You have, therefore, before you a cul­ <lb/>
            prit defiled with so many murders, a culprit taken in the very <lb/>
            fact, a culprit who is a foreigner. Unhesitatingly, then, pass <lb/>
            sentence on this stranger, for a crime, for the commission of <lb/>
            which you would severely punish one of your own citizens."</p>
          <p>My most unsparing accuser having thus spoken, closed his <lb/>
            tremendous harangue.</p>
          <p>The moment he ceased, the crier ordered me to begin, if I <lb/>
            wished to make any reply to what had been said. But as for <lb/>
            me, at that moment I could do nothing but weep ; not, by <lb/>
            Hercules! so much on account of the dreadful accusation, as of <lb/>
            my own wretched conscience. At last, however, inspired by the <lb/>
            gods with some degree of boldness, I thus answered the charge:</p>
          <p>"I am far from ignorant how difficult it is for any one, <lb/>
            when three corpses of citizens are lying exposed, and he is <lb/>
            accused of the murder, to persuade so vast a multitude that he <lb/>
            is really innocent, while he speaks the truth, and readily con­ <lb/>
            fesses that he committed the deed. But if your humanity will <lb/>
            allow me a public hearing for a short time, I shall have no <note type="footnote"> * Third watch.]—The night was divided by soldiers into four parts, <lb/>
            each of which was called a watch, and consisted of three hours. </note> <pb n="51"/>

            difficulty in showing you that I now stand in peril of my life, <lb/>
            not through any ill-deserts of my own, but that it is through a <lb/>
            fortuitous result of justifiable indignation, that I am innocently <lb/>
            subjected to the reproach of so great a crime.</p>
          <p>" For, as I was returning from an entertainment, somewhat <lb/>
            later than usual, and besides, being in a state bordering on <lb/>
            intoxication, which indeed I will not deny was really my <lb/>
            crime, I beheld before the door of the place where I reside <lb/>
            (for I am staying with your worthy fellow-citizen Milo), I be­ <lb/>
            held, I say, some most desperate robbers trying to force an <lb/>
            entrance, and to wrench the door off its hinges. Already they <lb/>
            had with great violence torn away all the bars which had <lb/>
            been put up with the greatest care, and at that very moment <lb/>
            they were meditating the murder of the inhabitants within. <lb/>
            One of them, in fact, who was the most active with his hands, <lb/>
            and the largest in bulk, was encouraging the others with these <lb/>
            words, ' Come on, my lads, let us fall upon those within while <lb/>
            they are asleep, with manly spirits and vigorous hands. Be <lb/>
            all hesitation, all sluggishness, banished from your breasts. <lb/>
            Let slaughter stalk, sword in hand, from one end of the house <lb/>
            to the other. Let him who lies sound asleep be put to death ; <lb/>
            let him who endeavours to resist be knocked down. Thus shall <lb/>
            we get off in safety, if we don't leave a single person in safety <lb/>
            in the house.'</p>
          <p>"I confess it, citizens; seeing that I entertained extreme <lb/>
            fears both on account of my entertainers and myself, and that <lb/>
            I was armed with a sword which I carried with me as a pro­ <lb/>
            vision against dangers of this kind, I thought it was the duty <lb/>
            of a good member of the community, to endeavour to alarm <lb/>
            and put to flight these most desperate robbers. But the <lb/>
            barbarous and bloodthirsty villains were far from taking <lb/>
            to flight; and though they raw that I was armed, they still <lb/>
            offered a bold resistance, and stood their ground in battle <lb/>
            array. In fact, the leader and standard-bearer, as it were, <lb/>
            of the rest, attacking me at once with great impetuosity, <lb/>
            seizing me by the hair with both his hands, and bend­ <lb/>
            ing me backward, tried to smash me with a stone. But <lb/>
            while he was crying out for one to be handed to him, making <lb/>
            a sure thrust at him, I fortunately laid him prostrate. Pre­ <lb/>
            sently, I slew another, who was clinging to my legs and biting <lb/>
            my feet, piercing him with a well-aimed blow through the <note type="footnote"> r 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="52"/>
            middle of his shoulder-blade ; and the third I ran through the <lb/>
            breast while rushing upon me off his guard. Thus, the cause <lb/>
            of peace being vindicated, and the house of my host, and the <lb/>
            safety of the public, being protected, I did suppose that I <lb/>
            was not only not liable to punishment, but was even worthy <lb/>
            of the public praise : I who have never been accused even of <lb/>
            the smallest crime, but have been always highly respected in <lb/>
            my own country, and have ever preferred a character without <lb/>
            guile to every earthly good. Neither am I able to compre­ <lb/>
            hend why I am now exposed to this accusation for a justifiable <lb/>
            feeling of vengeance with which I was incited against these <lb/>
            most abominable robbers, since there is not a person who can <lb/>
            either prove that prior to this affair there was any private ani­ <lb/>
            mosity between us, or that these robbers were ever in any way <lb/>
            known by me. At all events, let something of which I stripped <lb/>
            them be shown, ere it be believed that I perpetrated such a <lb/>
            heinous crime through the desire of obtaining booty."</p>
          <p>Having thus said, my tears again burst forth, and with hands <lb/>
            stretched out in a suppliant attitude, I earnestly invoked <lb/>
            first one and then another, appealing to the public com­ <lb/>
            miseration, and the love they bore to their children, pledges <lb/>
            of affection. And when I now thought that they were all <lb/>
            moved by humanity, and that they were sufficiently affected <lb/>
            with commiseration for my tears, calling to witness the eye of <lb/>
            Justice and the Sun, and commending to the providence of the <lb/>
            gods my present case, I raised my eyes a little, and beheld the <lb/>
            entire body of the people ready to burst with laughter, and <lb/>
            even Milo, that worthy host of mine, who had professed the <lb/>
            affection of a father for me, laughing as immoderately as the <lb/>
            rest. Amazed at such a sight, I said to myself, "Alas! where <lb/>
            is probity, where is conscience ? Here am I become a homi­ <lb/>
            cide, and capitally convicted, in defence of the safety of my <lb/>
            host; while he, not content with abstaining from affording me the <lb/>
            comfort of his assistance, is grinning besides at my destruction."</p>
          <p>In the meantime a certain woman, dressed in black, and <lb/>
            carrying an infant at her bosom, came running through the <lb/>
            middle of the theatre, crying and lamenting, while behind her <lb/>
            followed an aged crone in ragged and dirty apparel, who also <lb/>
            testified her grief by similar wailings, while both of them <lb/>
            shook branches of olive in their hands. Then, hanging over <lb/>
            the bier on which the dead bodies lay covered up, and beating <pb n="53"/>
            <note type="margin"> BOOK III. </note> <lb/>
            their breasts and howling dismally, they exclaimed, "In the <lb/>
            name of public compassion, as you revere the common law of <lb/>
            humanity, take pity upon these young men who have been so <lb/>
            unworthily slain, and give to our widowed and solitary state <lb/>
            the solace of vengeance. At least afford assistance to this un­ <lb/>
            fortunate child, who is left destitute in its infancy, and make <lb/>
            a propitiatory sacrifice to your laws and the public well-being <lb/>
            with the blood of the cutthroat."</p>
          <p>After this appeal, the senior magistrate arose, and thus <lb/>
            addressed the people: " That this crime must be visited with <lb/>
            a severe punishment, not even he himself, who committed it, <lb/>
            is able to deny. Therefore one duty only remains for us, and <lb/>
            that of a secondary nature, namely, that we should discover <lb/>
            the other persons who were the accomplices in such an atro­ <lb/>
            cious deed. For it is by no means probable, that one solitary <lb/>
            individual could have deprived of life three such robust young <lb/>
            men as these. The truth, therefore, must be plucked from <lb/>
            him by means of torture. For the servant who attended him <lb/>
            has secretly taken flight, and the matter is brought to this issue <lb/>
            that he must himself be put to the question, and compelled to <lb/>
            declare who were his partners in his crime, in order that we <lb/>
            may be thoroughly freed from the fear of so dreadful a gang."</p>
          <p>Without any delay, the instruments of torture in use among <lb/>
            the Greeks, namely, fire and the wheel,* and various sorts of <lb/>
            scourges besides, were brought in. Then indeed my misery <lb/>
            was infinitely increased, because I was not to be allowed, at <lb/>
            least, to die unmutilated. But the old hag, who had aggra­ <lb/>
            vated everything by her weeping, exclaimed, " Most worthy <lb/>
            citizens, before you fasten to the cross this cutthroat thief, the <lb/>
            destroyer of my wretched sons, allow the corpses of the dead <lb/>
            to be uncovered, in order that being still more and more in­ <lb/>
            cited to a just indignation, by a contemplation of the beauty <lb/>
            as well as the youth of the slain, you may vent your rage upon <lb/>
            their murderer, with a severity proportioned to the magnitude <lb/>
            of his crime."</p>
          <p>These words were received with applause, and immediately <lb/>
            the magistrate ordered me with my own hands to uncover the <lb/>
            dead bodies which were laid on the bier. The lictors used most <lb/>
            strenuous efforts to enforce obedience to the command of the <lb/>
            magistrates, whilst I resisted and struggled as long as I could, <note type="footnote"> * Fire and the wheel.]—Achilles Tatius also mentions the wheel and <lb/>
            fire as being used by the Greeks for the purpose of extorting confession. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="54"/>
            unwilling to revive, as it were, the crime of the .day before by <lb/>
            a new display of the victims. At last, however, forcing away <lb/>
            my hand from my side, they extended it, to its own destruc­ <lb/>
            tion, over the dead bodies. Overcome at length by necessity, <lb/>
            I yielded; and, though with extreme reluctance, withdrew <lb/>
            the pall and exposed the corpses. But, good gods! what a sight <lb/>
            was there! what a prodigy! what a sudden change in my for­ <lb/>
            tunes ! A moment before, I was the property of Proserpine, <lb/>
            and was reckoned one of the family of Orcus, * but now the <lb/>
            aspect of affairs was totally changed; and I stood staring like <lb/>
            an idiot in mute amazement; nor is it in the power of language <lb/>
            to give a fitting description of the sight that now met my eyes.</p>
          <p>For these bodies of the murdered men were three inflated <lb/>
            wine skins, t pierced in various parts, and, as far as I could call <lb/>
            to my recollection my battle of the night before, they were <lb/>
            slashed in the very same places in which I had wounded the <lb/>
            robbers. Then the laughter which, through the sly manage­ <lb/>
            ment of some persons, had been for a while repressed, burst <lb/>
            forth among the people without restraint. Some congratu­ <lb/>
            lated me, in the exuberance of their hilarity, others pressed <lb/>
            their hands to their stomachs, to relieve their aching; all, <lb/>
            indeed, were drowned in floods of mirth as they left the theatre, <lb/>
            pausing every now and then to look back at me.</p>
          <p>For my own part, from the moment I lifted up that cloth, <lb/>
            I stood fixed and ice-cold as a stone, precisely as though I <lb/>
            had been one of the statues or columns of the theatre. Nor <lb/>
            had I yet emerged from the shades below, when my host, <lb/>
            Milo, came up, and taking me by the hand, drew me towards <lb/>
            him with gentle force, reluctant as I was to move, and in­ <lb/>
            cessantly sobbing with the- tears again gushing forth; and <lb/>
            then, avoiding the main streets, he led me through certain <lb/>
            bye-ways to his house, consoling me all the way with various <lb/>
            remarks, for I had not yet got over my grief and trepidation. <lb/>
            Nor, indeed, could he by any means assuage my indignation at <lb/>
            the insult I had received, which took deep root in my breast. <lb/>
            Presently, the magistrates, with their insignia, entered the house, <lb/>
            and endeavoured to appease me by addressing me as follows <note type="footnote"> * Family of Orcus.]—Orcus was one of the names of Plutus. </note><note type="footnote"> t Inflated wine skins.]—The' utres,' used for holding wine, were mostly <lb/>

            it for the sake of contumely that you were made to suffer that <lb/>
            which you take so sorely to heart. Dismiss, therefore, all your <lb/>

            you as its patron, and has passed a vote that your statue shall <lb/>
            be erected in brass."</p>
          <p>In reply to this address, I said, " To you, and to your,most <lb/>
            splendid and singularly excellentt city of Thessaly, I return com­ <lb/>
            mensurate thanks for such honors. But I would recommend <lb/>
            you to keep your statues and images for those who are more <lb/>
            worthy and of more advanced years than myself." Having spoken <lb/>
            thus modestly, and for a moment smiling with a cheerful coun­ <lb/>
            tenance, and pretending as much as I possibly could to be more <lb/>
            joyful, I courteously saluted the magistrates at their departure.</p>
          <p>Just then, a servant came running into the house, and said <lb/>
            to me, " Your relation, Byrrhaena, repeats her invitation, and <lb/>
            begs to remind you that the hour of the banquet is close at <lb/>
            hand, at which you promised last evening to be present."</p>
          <p>Full of horror at these words, and shuddering at the very <lb/>
            mention of her house, " Tell your mistress," said I, " that I <lb/>
            would most willingly obey her commands, if it were possible <lb/>
            to do so without violating my promise. But my host, Milo, <lb/>
            conjuring me by the deity who presides over this day, has <lb/>
            made me pledge myself to sup with him to-day; and he has <lb/>
            neither gone out of the house, nor will he suffer me to leave <lb/>
            him. On this account, I must put off my engagement to sup <lb/>
            with your mistress to another time." <note type="footnote"> * As each year returns.]—If this practice really did prevail with the <lb/>
            people of Thessaly, it bore a considerable resemblance to our April Fool Day. </note><note type="footnote"> t Singularly excellent.]—It is somewhat singular that Solinus, when <lb/>

            by way of compliment. </note> <pb n="56"/>
            </p>
          <p>All this while Milo held me fast by the hand, and when the <lb/>
            servant was gone, he took me to the nearest bath, having pre­ <lb/>
            viously ordered that the bathing utensils* should be sent after <lb/>
            us. But I, avoiding the gaze of all men, and shrinking from <lb/>
            the laughter of those I met, and of which I was myself the <lb/>
            subject, stuck close to his side, and screened myself under its <lb/>
            shadow, such was the shame I felt. But how I washed or <lb/>
            how I dried myself, or how I got home again, was more than <lb/>
            I could tell; so much was I confounded and bereft of my <lb/>
            senses on seeing myself pointed out by the eyes, the nods, and <lb/>
            the fingers of the people. At last, having hastily despatched a <lb/>
            paltry meal with Milo, and excusing myself on the ground of <lb/>
            a severe head-ache, occasioned by my long-continued weeping, <lb/>
            I readily obtained permission to retire to rest.</p>
          <p>Throwing myself upon my bed, I reflected painfully upon <lb/>
            all that had happened to me, till at length my Fotis, having <lb/>
            put her mistress to bed, came to me, very much changed fron <lb/>
            her usual appearance ; for she did not bring with her a joyoua <lb/>
            face, nor mirthful prattle, but a gloomy and wrinkled brow. <lb/>
            At length, speaking with hesitation and timidly, "I freely con­ <lb/>
            fess," said she, "that I have been the cause to you of this <lb/>
            day's trouble;" and so saying, she drew forth a kind of lash <lb/>
            from her bosom, and offering it to me, thus continued: " Take <lb/>
            your revenge, I pray you, upon a perfidious woman; ay, inflict <lb/>
            on me any punishment you please. Yet do not, I entreat you, <lb/>
            believe that of my own will I have occasioned you this an­ <lb/>
            guish. May the gods be more merciful to me, than that you <lb/>
            should suffer even the very smallest annoyance on my account! <lb/>
            Nay rather, if any disaster impend over your head, may it be <lb/>
            forthwith atoned for with my blood. It is a thing I was or­ <lb/>
            dered to do for quite another reason, that, with a sort of ill luck <lb/>
            peculiarly my own, has turned out to your injury."</p>
          <p>Urged by my usual curiosity, and longing to have the secret <lb/>
            cause of this transaction disclosed, I thus replied : " This most <lb/>
            abominable and most audacious of all whips, which you in­ <lb/>
            tended for me to beat you with, shall be chopped, and torn <lb/>
            to pieces, and utterly destroyed, before it shall touch your <note type="footnote"> * The bathing utenszls.]—The ' balnearia,' or bathing apparatus, gene­ <lb/>

            you, what act of yours is it, that the malignity of fortune has <lb/>
            converted to my detriment ? I swear by that face of yours, <lb/>
            most dear to me, that not any person whatsoever, not even your <lb/>
            own self, could make me believe that you harboured a thought <lb/>
            that could do me harm. And besides, no adverse results of <lb/>
            chance can cause harmless intentions to become culpable."</p>
          <p>When I had finished this little speech, with eager thirst and <lb/>
            close kisses, I sucked in love from the lips of my Fotis, whose <lb/>
            moist and tremulous eyes, half hidden by their drooping lids <lb/>
            were dull with the languor of desire. Her spirits being thus <lb/>
            revived: "First let me carefully shut the door," she said, "lest <lb/>
            I be guilty of a great offence, through the unguarded freedom <lb/>
            of the words that may escape me." Thus saying, she bolted <lb/>
            and locked the door securely, and then returning to me, and <lb/>
            clasping my neck with both her hands, she said, in a low and <lb/>
            very subdued tone of voice: "I am terrified, and tremble all <lb/>
            over, to disclose the mysteries of this house, and reveal the <lb/>
            secret doings of my mistress. But I have too high an opinion <lb/>
            of you and your breeding, not to trust you; for besides <lb/>
            your high-born dignity, and your own elevated mind, having <lb/>
            been initiated into various sacred mysteries, you have fully <lb/>
            learned the holy faith of secrecy; whatsoever, therefore, I shall <lb/>
            entrust to the inmost depths of this breast of yours, keep it <lb/>
            ever religiously concealed, I beseech you, within its recesses, <lb/>
            and repay the frankness of my narrative, by the strictest si­ <lb/>
            lence. For it is the power of that love by which I am bound <lb/>
            to you, that compels me to disclose to you matters which are <lb/>
            known to me alone, of all mortals. You will now learn every­ <lb/>
            thing that relates to our house; you shall now be made aware <lb/>
            of the wondrous secret powers of my mistress, to which the <lb/>
            spirits of the dead pay obedience; and by which the disturbs <lb/>
            the stars in their course, sways the elements, and enthrals the <lb/>
            divinities. Nor does she ever more readily resort to the powers <lb/>
            of this art, than when she has cast the eyes of desire upon a <lb/>
            good-looking young man, a thing, in fact, that happens to her <lb/>
            not unfrequently.</p>
          <p>" At the present moment, she is desperately in love with a <lb/>
            certain young man of Boeotia, who is extremely handsome, and <lb/>
            she is ardently employing the whole power, and every ma­ <lb/>
            noeuvre of her art. I heard her yesterday evening, with these <lb/>
            ears of mine, I heard her, I say, threaten the Sun himself, that <lb/>
             <pb n="58"/>
            she would involve him in a cloud of mist, and interminable <lb/>
            darkness, if that Sun did not make haste in his course through <lb/>
            the heavens, and speedily give place to the night, that she <lb/>
            might the sooner begin to exert her magic spells.</p>
          <p>" Yesterday, happening to catch sight of this youth in a bar­ <lb/>
            ber's shop,* as she was returning from the bath, she secretly <lb/>
            gave me orders to bring away the cuttings of his hair, which <lb/>
            were lying on the ground. As I was in the act of carefully <lb/>
            and stealthily collecting them, the barber caught me; and, be­ <lb/>
            cause from other circumstances we are publicly notorious as <lb/>
            exercising the black art, he laid hold on me, and rudely abused <lb/>
            me: 'What, you good-for-nothing jade, you can't leave off <lb/>
            pilfering the hair of the good-looking young men every now <lb/>
            and then ? If you don't, once for all, put an end to this, I <lb/>
            will take you without more ado before the magistrates.' Then, <lb/>
            suiting the action to the words, thrusting in his hands between <lb/>
            my breasts, and groping about them in a rage, he drew out <lb/>
            the hair I had previously concealed there. Grievously afflicted <lb/>
            by this treatment, and rejecting on the temper of my mistress, <lb/>
            who is always excessively enraged, and beats me in the most <lb/>
            cruel manner, when she is thwarted in a matter of this nature, <lb/>
            I had serious thoughts of running away, but when I thought <lb/>
            of you, I instantly abandoned that design. On my way home, <lb/>
            sad and empty handed, I espied a man clipping some goat <lb/>
            skins with a pair of shears. Seeing them so nicely sewn toge­ <lb/>
            ther, inflated, and standing by themselves, I took up a parcel <lb/>
            of the hair from them which lay scattered on the ground, and <lb/>
            being of a yellow colour, resembled that of the young Bœotian; <lb/>
            and this goat's hair I gave to my mistress, concealing the truth.</p>
          <p>" Accordingly, at night-fall, before you returned from the <lb/>
            entertainment, Pamphile, my mistress, now in a state of frenzy, <lb/>
            went up into a belvedere covered with shingles, which she <lb/>
            secretly frequents, as being especially adapted to these pursuits <lb/>
            of hers, for it is open on every side to the winds, and commands <lb/>
            a prospect of the eastern and all the other points. There she <lb/>
            began by arranging in her deadly workshop all the customary <lb/>
            implements of her art, such as aromatics of all kinds, plates of <lb/>
            metal engraved with talismanic characters, nails from ship­ <lb/>
            wrecked vessels, as also, multitudes of limbs and fragments <note type="footnote"> * In a barber's shop.]—Among the ancients, the tonstrinse,' or barbers' <lb/>
            shops, were places devoted to news and gossip; as such, we find them <lb/>
            frequently alluded to in the plays of Plautus and Terence. </note> <pb n="59"/>
            <note type="margin"> BOOK IrI. </note> <lb/>
            stolen from graves. Here, were noses and fingers, there, the <lb/>
            nails by which culprits had been fixed to the cross, and to <lb/>
            which portions of flesh adhered; and, in another place, the <lb/>
            blood of murdered persons, bottled up, and mangled skulls of <lb/>
            men who had been devoured by wild beasts.</p>
          <p>" Next, having pronounced an incantation over entrails still . <lb/>
            warm and palpitating, she makes a libation with various <lb/>
            liquors, first, with water from the spring; next, with the <lb/>
            milk of cows; and then, with mountain honey and mead. <lb/>
            Then, after plaiting the goats' hairs together, and tying them <lb/>
            in a knot, she burns them on live coals, with abundance of <lb/>
            perfumes. That instant, through the irresistible power of the <lb/>
            magic art, and through the occult might of the coerced divi­ <lb/>
            nities, those same bodies, the hairs of which were smoking <lb/>
            and crackling, received human breath, were endowed with un­ <lb/>
            derstanding, heard, and walked. Whither the odour of the <lb/>
            burning spoils attracted them, thither came they; and instead <lb/>
            of that Boeotian youth, it was they who bumped away at the <lb/>
            door, endeavouring to effect an entrance. Just at that mo­ <lb/>
            ment up came you, well steeped in liquor, and deceived by the <lb/>
            darkness of the night, you drew your sword, just like the frantic <lb/>
            Ajax, but not like him to slay whole flocks of sheep ;* a far <lb/>
            more valiant deed was yours, for you deprived of breath three <lb/>
            inflated goat skins, so that, having laid your adversaries prostrate, <lb/>
            without staining yourelf with a drop of blood, I can now clasp <lb/>
            you in my arms, not as a homicide, but as a wine-bagicide."</p>
          <p>Responding in the same strain to the jocular remarks of Fotis, <lb/>
            I said: "Now, then, I may match this first exploit of my prowess <lb/>
            with one of the twelve labours of Hercules, comparing the <lb/>
            three wine skins I slaughtered to the three-fold body of Geryon, <lb/>
            or to the triple form of Cerberus. But, that I may forgive <lb/>
            you with all my heart for the fault through which you in­ <lb/>
            volved me in miseries so extreme, comply with one most ear­ <lb/>
            nest request of mine. Let me have sight of your mistress <lb/>
            when she next makes any use of this supernatural power, so <lb/>
            that when she is invoking the gods, I may at least see her as­ <lb/>
            sume another form. For I am most ardently desirous of ob­ <lb/>
            taining a nearer acquaintance with the arts of magic; though, <lb/>
            by the by, you yourself seem to me to be not altogether a no­ <lb/>
            vice in such matters. This I know, and feel most sensibly; <note type="footnote"> * Whole flocks of sheep.]-In his madness consequent upon his being <lb/>
            refused the arms of Achilles, which were awarded to Ulysses. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="60"/>
            for whereas I have always been averse to the overtures of <lb/>
            highborn ladies, now by those brilliant eyes of yours, your <lb/>
            rosy lips, your shining hair, your open-lipped kisses, and your <lb/>
            perfumed bosom, you hold me voluntarily enthralled, and sub­ <lb/>
            jected to you as much as any slave. In fact, I am neither an­ <lb/>
            xious to return home, nor am I making any preparations for that <lb/>
            purpose, and nothing is there which I could prefer to this night."</p>
          <p>" How gladly, Lucius, would I accomplish what you desire," <lb/>
            she replied, " but my mistress is so afraid of the malice and <lb/>
            curiosity of the public, that she always performs her mysterious <lb/>
            ceremonies in the strictest solitude and privacy. Still, I will <lb/>
            consider your gratification more than my own danger, and will <lb/>
            look out for a suitable opportunity to accomplish what you <lb/>
            wish. Do you only, as I admonished you at the beginning, <lb/>
            faithfully preserve silence upon a matter of such importance."</p>
          <p>While we thus conversed together, mutual desire seized us; <lb/>
            and inspired with a Bacchanalian frenzy, as it were, we rushed <lb/>
            into each other's arms. At last, after long wakefulness, sleep <lb/>
            fell upon our weary eyes, and detained us in bed till late in the <lb/>
            following day.</p>
          <p>After some few nights delightfully passed in this manner, <lb/>
            Fotis came running to me one day in great excitement and <lb/>
            trepidation, and informed me that her mistress, having hitherto <lb/>
            made no proficiency by other means in her present amour, in­ <lb/>
            tended to assume feathers like a bird, and so take flight to <lb/>
            the object of her love ; and that I must prepare myself with <lb/>
            all due care for the sight of such a wonderful proceeding. <lb/>
            And now, about the first watch of the night, she escorted me, <lb/>
            on tip-toe and with noiseless steps, to that same upper cham­ <lb/>
            ber, and bade me to peep through a chink in the door, which <lb/>
            I did accordingly.</p>
          <p>In the first place, Pamphile divested herself of all her gar­ <lb/>
            ments, and having unlocked a certain cabinet, took out of it <lb/>
            several little boxes. Taking the lid off of one of them, and <lb/>
            pouring some ointment therefrom, she rubbed herself for a con­ <lb/>
            siderable time with her hands, smearing herself all over from <lb/>
            the tips of her toes to the crown of her head. Then, after she <lb/>
            had muttered a long while in a low voice over a lamp, she <lb/>
            shook her limbs with tremulous jerks, then gently waved them <lb/>
            to and fro, until soft feathers burst forth, strong wings dis­ <lb/>
            played themselves, the nose was hardened and curved into a <lb/>
            beak, the nails were compressed and made crooked. Thus did <pb n="61"/>
            <note type="margin"> BOOK III. </note> <lb/>
            Pamphile become an owl. Then, uttering a querulous scream, <lb/>
            she made trial of her powers, leaping little by little from <lb/>
            the ground; and presently, raising herself aloft, on full wing, <lb/>
            she flies out of doors. And thus was she, of her own will, <lb/>
            changed, by her own magic arts.</p>
          <p>But I, though not enchanted by any magic spell, still, rivetted <lb/>
            to the spot by astonishment at this performance, seemed to <lb/>
            myself to be any thing else rather than Lucius. Thus de­ <lb/>
            prived of my senses, and astounded, even to insanity, I was <lb/>
            in a waking dream, and rubbed my eyes for some time, to <lb/>
            ascertain whether or not I was awake at all. At last, however, <lb/>
            returning to consciousness of the reality of things, I took hold <lb/>
            of the right hand of Fotis, and putting it to my eyes, " Suffer <lb/>
            me," said I, "I beg of you, to enjoy a great and singular <lb/>
            proof of your affection, while the opportunity offers, and give <lb/>
            me a little ointment from the same box. Grant this, my <lb/>
            sweetest, I entreat you by these breasts of yours, and thus, by <lb/>
            conferring on me an obligation that can never be repaid, bind <lb/>
            me to you for ever as your slave. Be you my Venus, and let <lb/>
            me stand by you a winged Cupid."</p>
          <p>" And are you then, sweetheart, for playing me a fox's trick, <lb/>
            and for causing me, of my own accord, to let fall the axe upon <lb/>
            my legs ? Must I run such risk of having my Lucius torn from <lb/>
            me by the wolves of Thessaly ?* Where am I to look for him <lb/>
            when he is changed into a bird ? When shall I see him again?"</p>
          <p>"May the celestial powers," said I, " avert from me such a <lb/>
            crime! Though borne aloft on the wings of the eagle itself, <lb/>
            soaring through the midst of the heavens, as the trusty mes­ <lb/>
            senger, or joyous arm-bearer, of supreme Jove, would I not, <lb/>
            after I had obtained this dignity of wing, still fly back every <lb/>
            now and then to my nest ? I swear to you, by that lovely <lb/>
            little knot of hair, with which you have enchanted my spirit, <lb/>
            that I would prefer no other to my Fotis. And then besides, <lb/>
            I bethink me, that as soon as I am rubbed with that ointment, <lb/>
            and shall have been changed into a bird of this kind, I shall <lb/>
            be bound to keep at a distance from all human habitations; <lb/>
            for what a beautiful and agreeable lover will the ladies gain in <lb/>
            an owl! Why! do we not see that these birds of night, when <note type="footnote"> * Wolves of Thessaly —There is some doubt among the Commenta­ <lb/>

            probable that in her jealousy. Fotis intends to call the damsels of Thessaly <lb/>
            by that name. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="62"/>
            they have got into any house, are eagerly seized and nailed to <lb/>
            the doors,* in order that they may atone, by their torments, <lb/>
            for the evil destiny which they portend to the family by their <lb/>
            inauspicious night ? But one thing I had almost forgot to in­ <lb/>
            quire : what must I say or do, in order to get rid of my wings, <lb/>
            and return to my own form as Lucius ?"</p>
          <p>" Be in no anxiety," she said, "about all that matter; for my <lb/>
            mistress has made me acquainted with every thing that can <lb/>
            again change such forms into the human shape. But do not <lb/>
            suppose that this was done through any kind feeling towards <lb/>
            me, but in order that I might assist her with the requisite <lb/>
            remedies when she returns home. Only think with what <lb/>
            simple and trifling herbs such a mighty result is brought <lb/>
            about: for instance, a little anise, with some leaves of laurel <lb/>
            infused in spring water, and used as a lotion and a draught."</p>
          <p>Having assured me of this over and over again, she stole into <lb/>
            her mistress's chamber with the greatest trepidation, and took <lb/>
            a little box out of the casket. Having first hugged and kissed <lb/>
            it, and offered up a prayer that it would favour me with a <lb/>
            prosperous flight, I hastily divested myself of all my garments, <lb/>
            then greedily dipping my fingers into the box, and taking <lb/>
            thence a considerable quantity of the ointment, I rubbed it all <lb/>
            over my body and limbs. And now, flapping my arms up and <lb/>
            down, I anxiously awaited my change into a bird. But no <lb/>
            down, no shooting wings appeared, but my hairs evidently be­ <lb/>
            came thickened into bristles, and my tender skin was hardened <lb/>
            into a hide; my hands and feet, too, no longer furnished with <lb/>
            distinct fingers and toes, formed as many massive hoofs, and a <lb/>
            long tail projected from the extremity of my spine. My face <lb/>
            was now enormous, my mouth wide, my nostrils gaping, and <lb/>
            my lips hanging down. In like manner my ears grew hairy, <lb/>
            and of immoderate length, and I found in every respect I had <lb/>
            become enlarged.† Thus, hopelessly surveying all parts of my <lb/>
            body, I beheld myself changed not into a bird, but an ass.</p>
          <p>I wished to upbraid Fotis for the deed she had done; but, <lb/>
            now deprived both of the gesture and voice of man, I could only <lb/>
            expostulate with her silently with my under-lip hanging down, <note type="footnote"> * Nailed to the doors.]—We see the same sort of thing done at the <lb/>
            present day in some parts of England, where owls, hawks, bats, &amp;c., are <lb/>

            and looking sideways at her with tearful eyes. As for her, as <lb/>
            soon as she beheld me thus changed, she beat her face with her <lb/>
            hands, and cried aloud, " Wretch that I am, I am undone! In <lb/>
            my haste and flurry I mistook one box for the other, deceived <lb/>
            by their similarity. It is fortunate, however, that a remedy <lb/>
            for this transformation is easily to be obtained ; for, by only <lb/>
            chewing roses, you will put off the form of an ass, and in an <lb/>
            instant will become my Lucius once again. I only wish that <lb/>
            I had prepared as usual some garlands of roses for us last even­ <lb/>
            ing ; for then you would not have had to suffer the delay even <lb/>
            of a single night. But, at the break of dawn, the remedy shall <lb/>
            be provided for you."</p>
          <p>Thus did she lament; and as for me, though I was a per­ <lb/>
            fect ass, and instead of Lucius, a beast of burden, I still re­ <lb/>
            tained human sense : long and deeply, in fact, did I consider <lb/>
            with myself, whether I ought not to bite and kick that most <lb/>
            wicked woman to death. However, better thoughts recalled <lb/>
            me from such rash designs, lest, by inflicting on Fotis the <lb/>
            punishment of death, I should at once put an end to all chances <lb/>
            of efficient assistance. So, bending my head low, shaking-my <lb/>
            earu, I silently swallowed my wrongs for a time, and submitting <lb/>
            to my most dreadful misfortune, I betook myself to the stable <lb/>
            to the good horse which had carried me so well, and there I <lb/>
            found another ass also, which belonged to my former host <lb/>
            Milo. Now it occurred to me that, if there are in dumb animals <lb/>
            any silent and natural ties of sympathy, this horse of mine, <lb/>
            being influenced by a certain feeling of recognition and com­ <lb/>
            passion, would afford me room for a lodging, and the rights of <lb/>
            hospitality.* But, 0 Jupiter Hospitalis, and all you the guardian <lb/>
            divinities of Faith! this very excellent nag of mine, and the <lb/>
            ass, put their heads together, and immediately plotted schemes <lb/>
            for my destruction; and as soon as they beheld me approach­ <lb/>
            ing the manger, laying back their ears and quite frantic with <lb/>
            rage, they furiously attacked me with their heels, fearing I <lb/>
            had design upon their food; consequently I was driven away <lb/>
            into the farthest corner from that very barley, which the even <lb/>
            ing before I had placed, with my own hands, before that most <lb/>
            grateful servant of mine.</p>
          <p>Thus harshly treated and sent into banishment, I betook my- <note type="footnote"> * Rights of hospitality.]—' Lautiæ.' This was properly the name given <lb/>

             <pb n="64"/>
            self to a corner of the stable. And while I reflected on the inso­ <lb/>
            lence of .my companions, and formed plans of vengeance against <lb/>
            the perfidious steed, for the next day, when I should have be­ <lb/>
            come Lucius once more by the aid of the roses, I beheld against <lb/>
            the central square pillar which supported the beams of the <lb/>
            stable, a statue of the goddess Hippona,* standing within a <lb/>
            shrine, and nicely adorned with garlands of roses, and those, too, <lb/>
            recently gathered. Inspired with hope, the moment I espied <lb/>
            the salutary remedy, I boldly mounted as far as ever my fore <lb/>
            legs could stretch ; and then with neck at full length, and ex­ <lb/>
            tending my lips as much as I possibly could, I endeavoured to <lb/>
            catch hold of the garlands. But by a most unlucky chance, <lb/>
            just as I was endeavouring to accomplish this, my servant lad, <lb/>
            who had the constant charge of my horse, suddenly espied me, <lb/>
            sprang to his feet in a great rage, and exclaimed, How long <lb/>
            are we to put up with this vile hack, which, but a few mo­ <lb/>
            ments ago, was for making an attack upon the food of the <lb/>
            cattle, and is now doing the same even to the statues of the <lb/>
            Gods ? But if I don't this very instant cause this sacrilegious <lb/>
            beast to be both sore and crippled"—and searching for some­ <lb/>
            thing with which to strike me, he stumbled upon a bundle of <lb/>
            sticks that lay there, and, picking out a knotted cudgel, the <lb/>
            largest he could find among them all, he did not cease to be­ <lb/>
            labour my poor sides, until a loud thumping and banging at <lb/>
            the outer gates, and an uproar of the neighbours shouting <lb/>
            thieves! struck him with terror, and he took to his heels.</p>
          <p>The next moment the doors were burst open, an armed band <lb/>
            of robbers rushed in, and surrounded the house on all sides; <lb/>
            people ran from all quarters to help the defence, but the rob­ <lb/>
            bers beat them off. Being all furnished with swords and <lb/>
            torches, they illuminated the darkness of the night; and their <lb/>
            swords gleamed like the rays of the rising sun. Then with <lb/>
            their strong axes they broke open the stout bars and fastenings <lb/>
            of a strong room in the middle of the house, which was filled <lb/>
            with Milo's treasures, and having completely ransacked it, <lb/>
            they hastily divided the booty, and tied it up in separate pack­ <lb/>
            ages. Now the number of packages exceeded that of the men <lb/>
            who were to carry them. Hence, being brought to extraor­ <lb/>
            dinary shifts, through a superabundance of wealth, they led <lb/>
            forth us, the two asses, and my horse, from the stable, loaded <note type="footnote"> * The goddess Hippona.]— This was the guardian goddess of horse3 and <lb/>

            us with the heaviest burdens they possibly could, and drove us <lb/>
            before them from the empty house, flourishing their sticks over <lb/>
            us. Leaving one of their companions behind as a spy, to bring <lb/>
            them word as to any proceedings taken in consequence of the <lb/>
            robbery, they hurried us along through the bye-paths of the <lb/>
            mountains, beating us every now and then, so that through the <lb/>
            weight of my load, the steepness of the mountain, and the in­ <lb/>
            terminable length of the way, I was no better than a dead <lb/>
            donkey. At last I very seriously thought of resorting to the <lb/>
            aid of the civil power, and liberating myself from so many <lb/>
            miseries, by invoking the august name of the Emporor.</p>
          <p>Accordingly, when, in broad daylight, we were passing <lb/>
            through a certain populous village, which was thronged with <lb/>
            people celebrating a fair, I strove, in the midst of that <lb/>
            crowd of Greeks, to utter the august name of Cæsar, in the <lb/>
            native language, and I cried out 0! *. distinctly and sono­ <lb/>
            rously ; but that was all, for the name of Cæsar I was not able <lb/>
            to pronounce. The robbers abominating my discordant cla­ <lb/>
            mour, thumped and gored my miserable hide, and left it <lb/>
            hardly fit for a corn sieve.t But at last, that good Jupitert <lb/>
            bestowed on me an unexpected chance of deliverance. For <lb/>
            after we had passed by many small farms and fine country <lb/>
            houses, I espied a delightful little garden, in which, besides <lb/>
            other sweet flowers, there were virgin roses, § dripping with the <lb/>
            morning dew. With longing desire, and overjoyed by the <lb/>
            hope of safety, I moved towards them. But while, with <lb/>
            quivering lips, I was preparing to seize them, this very im­ <lb/>
            portant reflection came across me : if I divested myself of the <lb/>
            asinine form, and again became Lucius, while in the hands of <lb/>
            the robbers, they would surely kill me, either as a supposed <lb/>
            magician, or for fear that I should inform against them. For <lb/>
            the present, therefore, as a matter of necessity, I abstained <lb/>
            from roses, and putting up with my present misfortune, was <lb/>
            fain to champ my bridle under the guise of an ass. <note type="footnote"> * Cried out 0 !]—He wished to invoke the emperor, in the words ' Oh, <lb/>

          <p>TOWARDS the middle of the day, when everything was scorched <lb/>
            by the burning heat of the sun, we turned aside into a certain <lb/>
            village, to the house of some old men, who were friends and <lb/>
            acquaintances of the robbers; for so their first salutations, their <lb/>
            lengthened conversation, their exchange of embraces, enabled <lb/>
            me, ass as I was, to perceive. They made them presents of <lb/>
            some things which they took off my back; and with secret <lb/>
            whispers seemed to inform them that they had been obtained <lb/>
            by burglary. At length, having lightened us of all our burden, <lb/>
            they turned us into the next meadow, to graze as we pleased. <lb/>
            My sense of conviviality, however, was not sufficient to keep me <lb/>
            in the company of the ass, or of my horse, especially as I was <lb/>
            not habituated to making my dinner upon grass. But as I <lb/>
            was now perishing with hunger, I boldly effected an entrance <lb/>
            into a little garden I caught sight of, behind the stable, and <lb/>
            ate my bellyful of the vegetables, raw as they were. Then <lb/>
            invoking all the gods, I looked about in every quarter to see if <lb/>
            by chance I might any where espy in the neighbouring gar­ <lb/>
            dens a rose-tree in full bloom. For the solitude of the spot, <lb/>
            its distance from the public road, and the fruit trees that con­ <lb/>
            cealed it, now afforded me great hopes, that if, on taking the <lb/>
            remedy, I should quit the grovelling gait of a four-footed beast <lb/>
            of burden and become erect again, in the shape of a man, I <lb/>
            might do so, unobserved by any body.</p>
          <p>Whilst, then, I was fluctuating amid this sea of contempla­ <lb/>
            tion, I beheld, a little further on, a dell shaded by a leafy <pb n="67"/>
            <note type="margin"> BOOK IT </note> <lb/>
            grove; and among its various plants and delightful foliage, <lb/>
            shone the vermilion tint of blooming roses. In my imagina­ <lb/>
            tion, which was not entirely that of a brute, I pictured this to <lb/>
            myself as the grove of Venus and the Graces; among whose <lb/>
            shady recesses, the regal splendour of that genial flower was <lb/>
            brilliantly glowing. So, invoking Prosperous Event, * I ran <lb/>
            with such speed, that, by Hercules! I fancied myself no longer <lb/>
            an ass, but an exceedingly swift racer of the circus. Still this <lb/>
            remarkable effort of activity was unable to outstrip my evil <lb/>
            fortune. For when I had now arrived at the spot, I no longer <lb/>
            saw those fresh and charming roses, wet with divine dews <lb/>
            and with nectar, which happy brambles and thrice-blessed <lb/>
            thorns produce, nor, indeed, any dell whatever, but only the <lb/>
            margin of a river's bank, planted with thickset trees. These <lb/>
            trees had long leaves like those of the laurel, and bore a sort of <lb/>
            inodorous blossom of a cup-like form and red colour. These <lb/>
            scentless flowers the ignorant common people call, in their <lb/>
            rural vocabulary, rose-laurels, to eat which is sure death to all <lb/>
            cattle.</p>
          <p>Finding myself ensnared by such a fatality, and casting <lb/>
            aside all regard for safety, I determined voluntarily to eat of <lb/>
            these envenomed roses. But, while I was hesitatingly ap­ <lb/>
            proaching in order to pluck them, a young fellow, the very <lb/>
            gardener, as I saw, whose vegetables I had so shockingly laid <lb/>
            waste, perceiving the loss he had sustained, ran furiously at <lb/>
            me with a great stick in his hand, and having caught me, <lb/>

            For throwing up my rump, I struck out at him rapidly and <lb/>
            repeatedly with my hind feet, and having severely punished <lb/>
            him, and laid him prostrate against a bank on the mountain's <lb/>
            side, sought safety in flight.</p>
          <p>Instantly, however, a certain woman, his wife, I suppose, <lb/>
            catching sight of him from an elevated spot, as he lay prostrate <lb/>

            dently on purpose, that by her lamentations she might be the <lb/>
            occasion of my instant destruction. For all the villagers, being <lb/>
            aroused by her screams, straightway called out their dogs, and <lb/>
            from. all quarters hounded them on, in order that, exasperated <lb/>
            by fury, they might rush upon me and tear me in pieces. I <lb/>
            made no doubt whatever but that I was on the brink of death <lb/>
            when I saw the dogs, very large ones too, and many in number, <lb/>
            and fit to fight with bears and lions, rushing furiously against <lb/>
            me from all quarters. Adopting, therefore, what seemed my <lb/>
            only chance, I gave up all thoughts of flight, and galloped back <lb/>
            to the inn at which we had put up. But the country people <lb/>
            keeping off the dogs with much difficulty, seized and bound <lb/>
            me with a very stout thong of leather to a staple, and would <lb/>
            no doubt have beat me to death, had it not been that my <lb/>
            stomach, compressed by the pain of the blows, and disordered <lb/>
            by those raw vegetables with which it was stuffed, squirted <lb/>
            out its contents, and drove away my persecutors from my <lb/>
            aching sides, besprinkling some of them with the most abo­ <lb/>
            minable liquid, and choking others with the stench.</p>
          <p>' Not long afterwards, as the sun was now declining from the <lb/>
            meridian, the robbers again led us forth from the stable heavily <lb/>
            laden, myself especially, whose burden was far heavier than that <lb/>
            of the rest. We had now completed a good part of the journey; <lb/>
            I was exhausted by its length and the weight of my burden, <lb/>
            sore from the cudgelling I had got, and lame and staggering <lb/>
            from my hoofs being quite worn to the quick; so, as I was <lb/>
            passing along the winding course of a gently flowing rivulet, I <lb/>
            was thinking that I would cunningly seize that excellent oppor­ <lb/>
            tunity, and lie down, bending my legs under me, fully deter­ <lb/>
            mined not to rise from the spot, whatever blows might be in­ <lb/>
            flicted on me; ay, ready even, not only to be beaten with a stick, <lb/>
            but pierced with a sword, rather than budge. For I imagined <lb/>
            that being now fully half dead and exhausted, I should receive <lb/>
            an honourable discharge,* on account of bodily infirmity: or, <lb/>
            that at least the robbers, irritated at the delay, and desirous of <lb/>
            hastening their flight, would divide the load which I carried <lb/>
            on my back between the two other beasts of burden, and that, <lb/>
            by way of a still more severe revenge, they would leave me a <lb/>
            prey to the wolves and vultures. <note type="footnote"> 0 An honourable discharge.]—‘ Causariam missionem.' This was a term <lb/>

          <p><note type="margin">BOOK IV. </note> My most cruel destiny, however, thwarted the execution of <lb/>
            so admirable a plan. For that other ass, divining and antici­ <lb/>
            pating my intention, immediately pretended to be overcome <lb/>
            with fatigue, and fell sprawling on the ground with all his bag­ <lb/>
            gage, and lying as if he was dead, made no attempt to rise for <lb/>
            all their whacking or goading, no, nor even when they tried <lb/>
            to pull him up on all sides by the tail, the ears, and the legs. <lb/>
            At last the robbers grew tired of the hopeless job, and having <lb/>
            conferred together, they resolved that their flight should not <lb/>
            be further retarded by wasting time upon an ass that was a,,; <lb/>
            good as stone dead. So, having divided his load between me <lb/>
            and the horse, and drawing a sword, they cut both his ham­ <lb/>
            strings ; then they dragged him, still breathing, a little out of <lb/>
            the public road, and threw him down a very lofty precipice <lb/>
            into the valley below. Then, indeed, taking warning by the <lb/>
            destiny of my unfortunate comrade, I determined to lay aside <lb/>
            all tricks and stratagems, and prove myself to my masters to <lb/>
            be a diligent, deserving ass. Besides, I had heard them say to <lb/>
            each other, that we should soon come to a stop, and make an <lb/>
            end of our journey and our toils, for yonder was the place pf <lb/>
            their abode.</p>
          <p>At length, having passed a little hill of easy ascent, we ar­ <lb/>
            rived at the place of our destination. All the things were un­ <lb/>
            packed and stowed away indoors; and being now relieved from <lb/>
            my burden, I took a refreshing roll in the dust in lieu of a <lb/>
            bath. The occasion itself, as well as the nature of my story, <lb/>
            demands that I should here give a description of the locality <lb/>
            and of the cave in which the robbers dwelt. For thus I shall <lb/>
            make trial of my own abilities, and at the same time enable <lb/>
            you to judge if I was an ass in sense and understanding as <lb/>
            well as in form.</p>
          <p>It was a rugged mountain, covered with dark forests, and of <lb/>
            extraordinary height. Winding athwart its declivity, flanked <lb/>
            by steep, inaccessible rocks, ran deep and intricate gullies, <lb/>
            choked with brambles, and thus affording a natural defence. <lb/>
            A spring burst forth from the summit of the mountain in great <lb/>
            bubbling gushes, and rolling its silvery waters down the steeps, <lb/>
            parted into a number of rivulets, formed pools in the valleys, <lb/>
            and encompassed the base of the mountain with large sheets of <lb/>
            standing water. On the rock, over the mouth of the cavern, <lb/>
            there was a sort of fort, constructed with strong posts and hur- <lb/>
             <pb n="70"/>
            dies, enclosing a space well suited for penning sheep. Before <lb/>
            the door there were small shrubs * extending along in place of <lb/>
            a wall, and this enclosure you may fairly denominate, on my <lb/>
            authority, the robbers' receiving room. There was no other <lb/>
            edifice in the place, except a small hut roughly covered with <lb/>
            reeds; in which sentinels, selected by lot from the band of <lb/>
            robbers, as I afterwards learned, kept watch by night.</p>
          <p>Leaving us secured by a stout leather thong before the door, <lb/>
            they crept into the cave, one after another, with their limbs <lb/>
            squeezed together, and bawled angrily to an old woman, who, <lb/>
            though bent with age, seemed to be entrusted with the entire <lb/>
            charge of so many young men.</p>
          <p>" What! you old corpse, whom Life is ashamed to own, and <lb/>
            Death scorns, do you mean to make game of us, sitting idly at <lb/>
            home, and not providing a supper to comfort us at this late <lb/>
            hour, after all our toil and peril ? You who do nothing day <lb/>
            and night but swill down wine into that craving stomach of <lb/>
            yours."</p>
          <p>"Nay, now," the frightened and trembling old woman <lb/>
            squeaked out, “ nay, now, my brave and honourable young <lb/>
            masters, there is plenty of nice stewed meat of all kinds, loaves <lb/>
            in abundance, wine without stint, in polished cups, and warm <lb/>
            water ready as usual for your hasty bath." When she had <lb/>
            said this, they immediately undressed, and standing naked be­ <lb/>
            fore a great fire, sluiced themselves with hot water, anointed <lb/>
            themselves with oil, and then went and reclined at a table <lb/>
            abundantly supplied with dishes.</p>
          <p>Hardly had they taken their places, when another and much <lb/>
            more numerous party of young men entered, whom you would <lb/>
            without hesitation have taken to be robbers also; for they, too, <lb/>
            brought with them booty in the shape of gold and silver money, <lb/>
            drinking vessels, and silken garments embroidered with threads <lb/>
            of gold. The new-comers having likewise refreshed themselves <lb/>
            by bathing, joined their comrades; and some who were chosen <lb/>
            by lot waited upon the rest. They ato and drank in a most <lb/>

            locks, and tankards ranged in whole platoons upon the board. <lb/>
            They were obstreperous in their mirth, sang as loud as they <lb/>
            could bawl, exchanged scurrilous jokes, and behaved in all <lb/>
            respects like Theban Lapithæ,* or half-brute Centaurs. At <lb/>
            last the burliest among them all thus addressed the rest:-</p>
          <p>" Right bravely have we ransacked that house of Milo, at <lb/>
            Hypata! And besides the vast booty we gained by our prowess, <lb/>
            we have brought back our full number to camp, safe and sound, <lb/>
            with an increase, too, of eight feet,† if that is worth men­ <lb/>
            tioning. But you, who have been pillaging the cities of Boeotia, <lb/>
            have brought back thinned numbers, having lost that bravest <lb/>
            of leaders, Lamachus, whose safety I should certainly have <lb/>
            preferred, and with good reason, to all these packages you have <lb/>
            brought home. Be that as it may, it was his own excess of <lb/>
            bravery that was his destruction, and the memory of so great <lb/>
            a hero will be celebrated among illustrious kings and leaders <lb/>
            in battle. But as for you, who are very careful robbers, you <lb/>
            do a trumpery trade ‡ in petty, dastardly thefts, sneaking <lb/>
            timidly about baths, and old women's bits of houses."</p>
          <p>To this, one of the new-comers replied, "You don't know,. <lb/>
            then, what is notorious to everybody, that large houses are <lb/>
            much the easiest to sack ? For though a great number of ser­ <lb/>
            vants is kept in them, still each of these has more regard for <lb/>
            his own safety than for his master's property. But people who <lb/>
            lead a frugal and retired life, vigorously defend their little <lb/>
            store, at the hazard of their lives: or else, if it is ample, they <lb/>
            keep it, to say the least, pretty carefully concealed. And, in <lb/>

            of each of the citizens, that being always the first thing to be <lb/>
            looked after by men of our profession : and so we came to hear <lb/>
            of a certain banker, by name Chryseros, a man who possessed <lb/>
            much money, but took great pains to conceal his vast wealth, <lb/>
            lest he should be required to serve in public capacities. In <lb/>
            fact, content with a small but remarkably well barred and <lb/>
            bolted house, he lived there all alone, ragged and dirty, and <lb/>
            brooded over his bags of gold.</p>
          <p>" Accordingly, we agreed to pay our first visit to him; for, <lb/>
            despising the resistance of a single pair of hands, we thought <lb/>
            we should, without any difficulty, carry off all his wealth. <lb/>
            Without delay, therefore, as soon as it was night, we met to­ <lb/>
            gether before his gate;. but as we did not think it prudent <lb/>
            either to take it off its hinges, or force it open, much less to <lb/>
            smash it, lest the noise of its two wings* should alarm all the <lb/>
            neighbourhood, to our destruction, that magnanimous standard- <lb/>
            bearer of ours, Lamachus, confident in his well-tried valour, <lb/>
            gradually introduced his arm through an aperture made for <lb/>
            the purpose of putting the key inside, and endeavoured to <lb/>
            draw back the bolt. But Chryseros, that most villanous of all <lb/>
            bipeds, having been on the watch all the time, and aware of all <lb/>
            that was going on, crept softly to the door, preserving a profound <lb/>
            silence, and with a sudden violent effort, fastened the hand <lb/>
            of our leader, with a great nail, to a pannel of the gate. Then, <lb/>
            leaving him transfixed, like a wretch on the cross, he ascended <lb/>
            to the roof of his hovel, and shouted with all his might to his <lb/>
            neighbours, calling to them by their respective names, and <lb/>
            advising them to have regard for their- common safety, for. <lb/>
            his house had caught fire unexpectedly. Accordingly, terrified <lb/>
            by the proximity of the imminent danger, every one ran <lb/>
            anxiously to render assistance.</p>
          <p>" In this dilemma, on the point of being overwhelmed by <lb/>
            numbers unless we deserted our comrade, we adopted, with his, <lb/>
            own consent, a desperate remedy, suggested by the circum­ <lb/>
            stances. For we cut off our leader's † arm by a blow right <lb/>
            through the joint; and leaving it there, we bound up the <note type="footnote"> * Its two wings.]—The doors of the ancients, whether opening in the <lb/>

            our track, and hastily carried off with us what remained of Lama­ <lb/>
            chus. The whole neighbourhood was now alarmed, and pursued <lb/>
            us with loud outcries; and we, in the fear of impending peril, <lb/>
            quickened our flight, whilst he could neither keep up with- our <lb/>
            swift pace, nor yet remain where he was with any safety. Then <lb/>
            this most magnanimous and transcendently brave man besought <lb/>
            us with all manner of prayers and entreaties, by the right hand <lb/>
            of Mars, and by our mutual oaths, to rescue a brave comrade <lb/>
            from torture and captivity. ' For how is it possible,' said he, <lb/>
            ‘that a brave robber can survive the loss of his right hand, <lb/>
            with which alone he can plunder and cut throats ? It would <lb/>
            be happiness for him to meet a voluntary death by the hand of <lb/>
            one of his comrades. As, however, he could not persuade any <lb/>
            one of us, with all his entreaties, to commit a voluntary act of <lb/>
            parricide, he drew his sword with his remaining hand, and <lb/>
            after kissing it repeatedly, plunged it with a mighty stroke <lb/>
            into the middle of his breast. Filled with veneration for the <lb/>
            courage of our magnanimous leader, we carefully wrapped his <lb/>
            mutilated dead body in a linen garment, and committed it to <lb/>
            the sea,* there to find a place of concealment. And now does <lb/>
            our Lamachust lie entombed, with the whole ocean for his <lb/>
            burying-place, after having ended his life in a manner worthy <lb/>
            of his heroic deeds.</p>
          <p>“ And Alcimus likewise, with all his well-concerted enter­ <lb/>
            prises, could not escape the sinister influence of fortune. He <lb/>
            had broken into an old woman's cottage while she was asleep, <lb/>
            and having ascended into an upper bedchamber, when he ought <lb/>
            instantly to have strangled her, he thought proper first to <lb/>
            throw all the things down to us, one by one, from the wide <lb/>
            window, in order that we might make off with them. Having <lb/>
            now cleared the room in a workmanlike manner, he had no <lb/>
            mind to spare even the mattress on which the old woman slept; <note type="footnote"> * Committed it to the sea.]—As Thebes was situate many miles from <lb/>
            the sea, either Apuleius is caught napping here, or he must have a rather <lb/>
            far-fetched meaning assigned to his words, and we must suppose that the <lb/>
            body was committed to the river Ismenius, to be carried down to the sea. </note><note type="footnote"> t Our Lamachus.]—We may here remark, that the several Greek <lb/>

            Lamachus may be rendered ' a champion;' Alcimus, a ' valiant man ;’ <lb/>
            Chryseros, ' a lover of gold;’ Demochares, ' beloved by the people;' and <lb/>
            Thrasyleon, ' a bold lion.' </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="74"/>
            so, rolling her out of it, he was preparing to throw the coun­ <lb/>
            terpane after the other things, when the' abominable old <unclear>ag</unclear> <lb/>
            fell on her knees before him, crying: ‘ Why, my son, I be­ <lb/>

            most wretched old woman to my wealthy neighbours, upon <lb/>
            whose house this window looks out ?'</p>
          <p>“ Alcimus, deceived by these crafty words, and believing what <lb/>
            she said to be true, was afraid that the things he had already <lb/>
            thrown out, and those he was about to send after them, might, <lb/>
            through his mistake, fall not into the hands of his associates, <lb/>
            but into other people's houses; he therefore thrust his body <lb/>
            out of the window, in order that he might make a judicious <lb/>
            survey of the environs, and particularly that he might look <lb/>
            with an eye to future business at that adjoining house she had <lb/>
            mentioned. While, however, he was intent upon this, and <lb/>
            quite careless of his own safety, that old miscreant took him <lb/>
            unawares, as he leaned outwards, with his body balancing un­ <lb/>
            steadily, and with a push which, though feeble, was sudden and <lb/>
            unexpected, she pitched him out headlong. Besides falling from <lb/>
            a great height, he dropped upon an enormous great stone <lb/>
            which happened to lie near the house, so that he smashed all <lb/>
            his ribs, and lay vomiting streams of blood, till, after he had <lb/>
            first related* to us what had taken place, death put a speedy <lb/>
            end to his torments Him also we buried in the same manner <lb/>
            as our former leader, and sent him, as a worthy comrade, to <lb/>
            follow Lamachus.</p>
          <p>" Having thus suffered a double loss, we now abandoned our <lb/>
            Theban enterprises, and departed for the next city, which is <lb/>
            Plateæ. Here we heard a great deal of talk about a person <lb/>
            named Demochares, who was about to exhibit a spectacle of <lb/>
            gladiators. For, being a man of high birth, and distinguished <lb/>
            for his great wealth and liberality, he catered for the public <lb/>
            amusement with a splendour commensurate with his fortune. <lb/>
            Where is the man with genius and eloquence enough to do- <lb/>
            scribe, in appropriate words, all the various details of the <lb/>
            manifold preparations? There were gladiators famous for <lb/>
            dexterity of hand ; hunters of well-tried swiftness of foot; and <lb/>
            criminals who, having forfeited their right to live in safety, <lb/>
            were being fattened as food for wild beasts. There were great <note type="footnote"> * He had first related.]—‘ Primitus' is perhaps a better reading here <lb/>
            than ' irnitus.' </note> <pb n="75"/>
            <note type="margin"> BOOK IT. </note> <lb/>
            wooden stages, with towers formed of planks, like moveable <lb/>
            houses, adorned outside with pictures, and serving as hand­ <lb/>
            some receptacles for the performers in the exhibition. And <lb/>
            then what a number, what a diversity of wild beasts! For <lb/>
            he had been at great pains to procure, even from abroad, those <lb/>
            noble living tombs of condemned men.</p>
          <p>" Among his other costly preparations, he had procured, in. <lb/>
            one way or other, with all the resources of his fortune, a great <lb/>
            number of huge bears. For, besides those captured by his own <lb/>
            servants in the chase, and those which he had bought at much <lb/>
            cost, others had been presented to him by his friends, who vied <lb/>
            with each other in showing him these attentions; and the <lb/>
            whole collection was maintained with great care and cost. <lb/>
            These noble and splendid preparations, however, for the public <lb/>
            amusement, could not escape the evil eye of invidious Fortune. <lb/>
            For these bears, pining and wasting away under their length­ <lb/>
            ened confinement, the burning heat of the summer, and the <lb/>
            debilitating effects of want of exercise, were attacked by a <lb/>
            sudden mortality, and reduced to a very inconsiderable num­ <lb/>
            ber. Hence, you might everywhere have seen bodies of half- <lb/>
            dead bears lying in the streets, like so many shipwrecked <lb/>
            vessels; and the ignoble mob, whose poverty compelled them <lb/>
            to fill their pinched bellies with any filthy offal, began to flock <lb/>
            about the food that was lying in all directions.</p>
          <p>"Prompted by this circumstance, Babulus here and I <lb/>
            thought of the following clever stratagem. We carried the <lb/>
            fattest of these bears to our lodging, as though intending to pre­ <lb/>
            pare it for food; and having entirely stripped the skin from the <lb/>
            flesh, carefully preserving all the claws, and leaving the head of <lb/>
            the beast entire, as far as articulation with the neck, we care­ <lb/>
            fully scraped the hide, sprinkled it with fine ashes, and exposed <lb/>
            it in the sun to dry. While it was being purified of its oily <lb/>
            juices by the heat of that celestial fire, we gorged ourselves <lb/>
            with its pulpy flesh, and made those of the troop who were pre­ <lb/>
            sent take an oath to this effect: that one of our number--one <lb/>
            who surpassed the rest, not so much in stoutness of body as of <lb/>
            heart, and above all, one who should undertake it voluntarily- <lb/>
            being covered with this skin, should assume the form of a bear, <lb/>
            and then, being brought into the house of Demochares, should, <lb/>
            on a seasonable occasion, afford us an easy entrance through <lb/>
            the door, in the dead of night.</p><pb n="76"/>
            
          <p>" No few of our gallant troop did the cleverness of this <lb/>
            scheme encourage to undertake its execution; but Thrasyleon <lb/>
            was elected by the suffrages of the band as the fittest to per­ <lb/>
            form the hazardous service. With a serene countenance, he <lb/>
            enclosed himself in the hide, which was now rendered soft and <lb/>
            pliable; then with fine stitches we drew the edges together, <lb/>
            and covered the fine seams with the thick shaggy hair, fitting <lb/>
            Thrasyleon's head into the part close by the back of the mouth, <lb/>
            where the neck of the beast had been, and leaving small holes for <lb/>
            breathing about the nostrils and the eyes. Lastly, we enclosed <lb/>
            our most valorous comrade, now changed into a wild beast, <lb/>
            within a cage which we had bought for a small sum, into <lb/>
            which he sprang with unflinching courage; and having thus <lb/>
            completed the preliminaries of the stratagem, we proceeded to <lb/>
            the execution of the remainder.</p>
          <p>" Having learned, on enquiry, the name of a person called <lb/>
            Nicanor, who was sprung from a Thracian family, and between <lb/>
            whom and Demochares there were the strongest ties of friend­ <lb/>
            ship, we wrote a counterfeit letter, intimating that this kind <lb/>
            friend had dedicated the first fruits of his hunting to Demo­ <lb/>
            chares, by way of a graceful present. And now, the evening <lb/>
            being far advanced, availing ourselves of the favourable dark­ <lb/>
            ness, we presented to Demochares the cage in which Thrasy­ <lb/>
            leon was enclosed, together with the counterfeit letter; on <lb/>
            which, admiring the huge size of the beast, and overjoyed at <lb/>
            the opportune liberality of his friend, he immediately gave <lb/>
            orders that ten pieces of gold should be counted out from his <lb/>
            coffers to us who had brought him a present that afforded him <lb/>
            so much delight. Meanwhile, as novelty always excites the <lb/>
            curiosity of men and attracts them to unexpected sights, mul­ <lb/>
            titudes flocked together about the brute, admiring its size; but <lb/>
            our friend Thrasyleon very cleverly restrained their rather too <lb/>
            prying curiosity, by frequently rushing at them in a very <lb/>
            alarming way. By the unanimous voice of the citizens, Demo­ <lb/>
            chares was pronounced most lucky and fortunate, in that, after <lb/>
            so heavy a loss among his wild beasts, he had been able, in some <lb/>
            way or other, to repair his losses by this new supply. He or­ <lb/>
            dered the beast, therefore, to be immediately taken to his farm, <lb/>
            and that it should be conveyed with the greatest care.</p>
          <p>“ On. this, I interrupted him, and said, ‘ Be careful, sir, how <lb/>
            you suffer this animal, which has suffered severely from the heat <pb n="77"/>
            <note type="margin"> BOOK IV. </note> <lb/>
            of the sun, and the length of the distance, to be trusted among <lb/>
            a herd of many others, and those, according to what I hear, not <lb/>
            yet recovered. Why not provide some spot in your own house <lb/>
            for it, which is open and exposed to the breezes, and, if possible, <lb/>
            bordering upon some cool lake ? Are you not aware that <lb/>
            animals of this kind always couch in shady groves and dripping <lb/>
            caverns, on breezy hills, and near pleasant fountains ?' Demo­ <lb/>
            chares, taking the alarm at these admonitions, and reflecting <lb/>
            on the great number of wild beasts he had already lost, as­ <lb/>
            sented, without hesitation, to what I said, and readily permitted <lb/>
            us to place the cage wherever we pleased. ‘Besides,’ said I, <lb/>
            ' we ourselves are ready to watch here by night, before this <lb/>
            cage, in order that we may as carefully as is requisite give the <lb/>
            beast its food at the proper time, and its usual drink, as it is <lb/>
            distressed by the heat, and the harass it has suffered in being <lb/>
            brought hither.' Demochares, however, made answer: ‘We <lb/>
            do not stand in need of your services; for nearly every one in <lb/>
            my household is now, from long custom, well skilled in feeding <lb/>
            bears.'</p>
          <p>" After this, we bade him farewell; and going out of the gate <lb/>
            of the city, we espied a certain monument, standing at a con­ <lb/>
            siderable distance from the public road, in a solitary and retired <lb/>
            spot. Here we opened some coffins,* which, through rottenness <lb/>
            and age, had lost half of their lids, and which were tenanted <lb/>
            by dead bodies, that were now nothing but dust and ashes. <lb/>
            These we intended to use as so many hiding-places for our an­ <lb/>
            ticipated booty. Then having, according to the observance <lb/>
            -of our craft, watched for that season of a moonless night in <lb/>
            which sleep most powerfully invades and overcomes the <lb/>
            hearts of mortals with its first impetus, our band drew up, <lb/>
            -well-armed with swords, before the gates of Demochares, ready <lb/>
            to perform our agreement to plunder his house. In like man­ <lb/>
            ner, Thrasyleon crept forth from his cage, availing himself of <lb/>
            that precise moment of the night which is adapted to theft, and <lb/>
            instantly slew with his sword every one of the house guards <lb/>
            that lay fast asleep beside his cage, and lastly, the porter him­ <lb/>
            self. Then, taking the key, he opened the folding doors-of the <note type="footnote"> * Some coffins.]—‘ Capulus' ordinarily signifies the litter or bier on <lb/>
            which the dead body was laid out previous to burial. In this instance, <lb/>
            however, it seems to mean a wooden coffin. It was probably much the <lb/>
            same as the ' sandapila' used by the lower classes. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="78"/>
            gate, and as we immediately rushed in, he pointed out to us <lb/>
            the strong room, where he had sagaciously observed a quantity <lb/>
            of silver plate deposited in the evening. This being instantly <lb/>
            broken open by the combined force of our band, I recommended <lb/>
            each of my comrades to carry away as much gold and silver as <lb/>
            he could, and conceal it in those abodes of the dead, the most <lb/>
            trusty of all people, and then returning with speedy steps, get <lb/>
            ready a second burden, whilst I would remain alone, for our <lb/>
            common good, before the door of the house, and keep a careful <lb/>
            watch, until such time as they should return. Moreover, it <lb/>
            appeared to me that the figure of a bear, running about in the <lb/>
            middle of the house, was adapted to terrify any member of the <lb/>
            family who might happen to be awake. For who, however <lb/>
            brave and intrepid he might naturally be, would not, on behold­ <lb/>
            ing the huge form of such an enormous beast, in the night espe­ <lb/>
            cially, immediately betake himself to flight, and pulling to the <lb/>
            bolt, shut himself in, terrified and trembling, in his chamber ?</p>
          <p>“ A sinister event, however, thwarted all these judicious ar­ <lb/>
            rangements. For while I was waiting, in anxious suspense, <lb/>
            for the return of my comrades, one of the servant lads, happen­ <lb/>
            ing, so the Gods ordained, to be awoke by the noise, I suppose, <lb/>
            of the bear, crept gently forward, and seeing the wild beast <lb/>
            running loose, and wandering over the whole house, he silently <lb/>
            retraced his steps, and, as quickly as he could, gave notice to <lb/>
            all of what he had seen; immediately upon which, the whole <lb/>
            house was filled with a numerous assemblage of the domestics. <lb/>
            The darkness was illuminated with torches, lamps, wax tapers, <lb/>
            tallow candles, and other appliances for giving light by night. <lb/>
            And not one was there in the throng without arms of some de­ <lb/>
            scription, but all were furnished with clubs, spears, and drawn <lb/>
            swords, with which they guarded the approaches to the house. <lb/>
            And then they hallooed on some of those hunting dogs, with <lb/>
            long ears and shaggy hair, to attack the wild beast.</p>
          <p>“ Upon this, the tumult still increasing, I made my way <lb/>
            stealthily out of the house, and concealing myself behind the <lb/>
            gate, I saw Thrasyleon defending himself in a wonderful manner <lb/>
            against the dogs. For, though he had now arrived at the very <lb/>
            uttermost goal of life, still, forgetful neither of himself nor of <lb/>
            us, nor his former valour, he struggled, as it were, in the very <lb/>
            jaws of Cerberus. In fact, acting with spirit up to the scenic <lb/>
            character which he had voluntarily assumed, at one moment <pb n="79"/>
            <note type="margin"> BOOK IT. </note> <lb/>
            flying and at another resisting, with various gestures and con. <lb/>
            tortions of his body, he at length escaped from the house. <lb/>
            Still, though he had gained his liberty, so far as being in the <lb/>
            public road, he was not able to ensure his safety by flight; for <lb/>
            all the dogs belonging to the next lane, and they were very <lb/>
            savage and numerous, joined in whole troops with the hunting <lb/>
            dogs, which had rushed out of the house, in full pursuit of him. <lb/>
            I was then witness of a shocking and frightful spectacle,—our <lb/>
            friend Thrasyleon, surrounded and hemmed in by troops of <lb/>
            raging dogs, and lacerated all over by their teeth.</p>
          <p>" At last, unable to endure so shocking a spectacle, I mingled <lb/>
            with the surrounding crowds of people, and this being the <lb/>
            only way in which I could secretly give assistance to my brave <lb/>
            comrade, I thus attempted to divert the promoters of the at­ <lb/>
            tack from their purpose, ‘ Oh what an enormous shame,' said <lb/>
            I, ' thus to destroy such a fine and remarkably valuable beast.' <lb/>
            The artifice failed, however, and all I could say had no in­ <lb/>
            fluence in favour of the unfortunate young man. For a tall <lb/>
            strong fellow came running out of the house, and instantly <lb/>
            thrust a spear through the bear's vitals; another followed his <lb/>
            example ; and then a great many took courage to assault him <lb/>
            at close quarters, and vied with each other in piercing him <lb/>
            with their swords. But as for Thrasyleon, that distinguished <lb/>
            honor to our band, his heroic life, so worthy of immortality, <lb/>
            being at length vanquished, though not his fortitude, he <lb/>
            did not forfeit the oath he had plighted by any vociferation, <lb/>
            shrieks, or cries. But, lacerated as he was by tooth and steel, <lb/>
            he imitated to the last with all his might the growling and <lb/>
            bellowing of a wild beast, and thus enduring his present cala­ <lb/>
            mity with magnanimous fortitude, he kept his glory intact, <lb/>
            while he yielded up his life to fate. Still, so great was the <lb/>
            terror and dismay with which he had struck the crowd, that <lb/>
            until the dawn, ay, even when it was broad day, not one dared <lb/>
            to lay a finger even on the beast, dead as it lay, until at last, a <lb/>
            certain butcher, who was a little bolder than the rest, advanc­ <lb/>
            ing slowly and timidly, cut open the belly of the beast, and <lb/>
            stripped the bear's hide off the mighty robber. Thus, then, <lb/>
            was Thrasyleon also lost to us, but not lost to glory.</p>
          <p>" And now, immediately collecting those packages which the <lb/>
            trusty dead had taken care of for us, we made all haste to quit <lb/>
            the limits of Plateæ, while ever and anon the reflection came <lb/>
             <pb n="80"/>
            across our minds, that it is no wonder if fidelity is not to be <lb/>
            found among the living, since, abominating their perfidy, it has <lb/>
            descended to the dead. In fine, here we are, all of us fatigued <lb/>
            with the. weight of OUT loads, as well as the rough roads along <lb/>
            which we have travelled; we have lost three of our comrades, <lb/>
            and brought home the booty you see."</p>
          <p>END OF THE FOURTH EPISODE.</p>
          <p>After the robber had concluded his narrative, they poured out <lb/>
            libations of pure wine from golden cups, to the memory of their <lb/>
            deceased comrades ; and then, having propitiated the god Mars <lb/>
            by some songs, they went to sleep for a short time. Mean­ <lb/>
            while, the old woman served out to us fresh barley in such un­ <lb/>
            measured abundance, that my horse, in fact, amid such great <lb/>
            plenty, and having it all to himself, might have fancied he was <lb/>
            supping with the Salii.* But as for me, though I had been in <lb/>
            the habit of eating barley, well crushed, and long boiled in <lb/>
            broth, having found out a corner in which the remains of the <lb/>
            bread, belonging to the whole band, had been stored away, I <lb/>
            strenuously exercised my jaws, which ached with long-con­ <lb/>
            tinued fasting, and began to be covered with spiders' webs.</p>
          <p>When the night was far advanced, the robbers arose from <lb/>
            sleep, struck their tents, and, being variously equipped, some <lb/>
            of them being armed with swords, and others disguised as <lb/>
            spectres, t with hasty steps, they sallied forth from their abode. <lb/>
            But as for me, not even impending sleep could hinder me from <lb/>
            chewing on incessantly and eagerly. And though in former <lb/>
            times, when I was Lucius, I could get up from table contented <lb/>
            with one or two loaves, yet now, having to fill so capacious a <lb/>
            belly, I -had nearly eaten up a third basketful of bread, when <lb/>
            broad daylight found me still intent upon this employment. <lb/>
            At length, however, moved by the modesty of an ass, I quitted <lb/>
            my food, but most reluctantly, and slaked my thirst at a rivulet <lb/>
            close by. <note type="footnote"> * Supping with the Salii.]—The Salii were priests of Mars, whose <lb/>

            alarm, bringing with them no booty whatever, not so much as <lb/>
            a worthless garment. With all their swords, with all their <lb/>
            hands, ay, and with all the force of their band, they brought <lb/>
            but a solitary prisoner, a damsel of genteel figure, and, as her <lb/>
            style of dress indicated, one of the first rank in those parts; a <lb/>
            girl, by Hercules! far from an object of indifference even to <lb/>
            me, ass as I was. As soon as they had brought her into the <lb/>
            cave, lamenting and tearing her hair and her garments, they <lb/>
            addressed her in words intended to alleviate her distress:</p>
          <p>" You really are in perfect security, both as to your life and <lb/>
            your honor; so have patience for a few days, if only out of <lb/>
            regard for our profit, for it is the pinch of necessity that has <lb/>
            compelled us to adopt this profession. Of course, your parents, <lb/>
            avaricious as they are, will give without delay, out of their <lb/>
            great hoards of wealth, a sum of money adequate to the ransom <lb/>
            of their own offspring.”</p>
          <p>The maiden's grief was far from alleviated by such rough <lb/>
            comforting as this; and no wonder; on the contrary, she wept <lb/>
            immoderately, with her face bent down upon her knees. So <lb/>
            they called in the old woman, and ordered her to sit by the <lb/>
            damsel, and amuse her as much as possible with soothing con­ <lb/>
            versation ; and then they betook themselves to their customary <lb/>
            avocations. But not by any words which the little old woman <lb/>
            employed could the maiden be made to cease her lamentations; <lb/>
            on the contrary, she cried louder than ever, and shook her sides <lb/>
            with such unintermitting sobs, that she drew tears from me also.</p>
          <p>"Is it possible, that I can cease to weep, or bear to live at <lb/>
            all ? miserable wretch that I am! torn from such a home, from <lb/>
            such friends, from such kind servants, such revered parents; <lb/>
            become the prey of nefarious rapine, a captive and a slave, <lb/>
            servilely shut up in this rocky prison, and deprived of all those <lb/>
            comforts amid which I was born and nurtured; not safe a mo­ <lb/>
            ment from the butcher's knife; in the power of such a num­ <lb/>
            ber of outrageous robbers, such a horrible crew of gladiators!" <lb/>
            Thus she continued to lament, until, worn out with grief of <lb/>
            mind, the spasmodic tension of her throat, and fatigue of body,. <lb/>
            at last she closed her languid eyes in slet p.</p>
          <p>Scarcely, however, had she dozed off, when, suddenly start­ <lb/>
            ing up again, as if bereft of her senses, she began to afflict <lb/>
            herself much more violently than before, and with cruel hands <note type="footnote"> <unclear>G</unclear> </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="82"/>
            to beat her bosom and her beautiful face. And although the <lb/>
            old woman most urgently enquired the cause of this fresh burst <lb/>
            of grief, she only replied with a deep groan:</p>
          <p>" Now, alas! beyond a doubt, I am utterly undone, now I <lb/>
            renounce all hope of safety. A halter, a sword, or a precipice, <lb/>
            that is what I must come to."</p>
          <p>On hearing this, the old woman grew a little angry, and <lb/>
            bade her, with a severe expression of countenance, say why the <lb/>
            plague she was crying so; or why, after having been fast <lb/>
            asleep, she thus suddenly renewed her ungovernable lamenta­ <lb/>
            tions. " It is your design, I suppose," said she, “to defraud <lb/>
            my young men of the pretty sum of money which they will <lb/>
            get for your ransom. However, if you persist any farther, <lb/>
            without caring at all for those tears, of which robbers are in <lb/>
            the habit of making little account, I will pretty soon have you <lb/>
            burnt alive."</p>
          <p>Terrified by this threat, the maiden kissed her hand, and <lb/>
            said, " Spare me, my good mother, and, for the sake of hu­ <lb/>
            manity, bear a little with my most sad misfortune. Nor, in­ <lb/>
            deed, do I imagine that compassion is entirely extinguished in <lb/>

            my inseparable companion, dwelling with me in the same house, <lb/>
            indeed, sharing the same chamber and couch, and affianced to <lb/>
            me by mutual ties and the bonds of holy love. We had long <lb/>
            been engaged to each other in marriage, we had even been <lb/>
            registered on the tablets,! as wedded by the consent of our <lb/>
            parents; and the youth was engaged in sacrificing victims in <lb/>
            the temples and sacred edifices, accompanied by a numerous <lb/>
            throng of relatives and neighbours. The whole house was <lb/>

            her bosom, had dressed me becomingly in nuptial apparel, and <lb/>
            frequently loading me with honeyed kisses, was now, with <lb/>
            anxious hopes, looking forward to a future line of descendants;- <lb/>
            when, on a sudden, a band of robbers armed like gladiators, <lb/>
            rushed in with swords drawn and glittering, in fierce battle <lb/>
            array. They made no attempt to slay or plunder, but made <lb/>
            straight for our chamber in a compact column; and without <lb/>
            any struggle, or indeed, any resistance whatever on the part <lb/>
            of our servants, they tore me away, wretched creature, half <lb/>
            dead with fear, from the bosom of my trembling mother. <lb/>
            Thus were our nuptials dissolved, like those of the daughter of <lb/>
            Athrax,* or of Protesilaus.</p>
          <p>" And now again is my misery renewed, nay rather, increas­ <lb/>
            ed, by a most horrible dream. For I seemed to myself to be vio­ <lb/>
            lently dragged away from my home, from my chamber, from <lb/>
            my very bed, and to be hurried through desert wildernesses, <lb/>
            where I called aloud on the name of my most unfortunate <lb/>
            husband; and he, methought, as soon as he was deprived of <lb/>
            my embraces, still perfumed with essenced ointments, and <lb/>
            adorned with wreaths of flowers, was following my track as <lb/>
            I fled on other feet than my own.t And while with loud <lb/>
            cries he bewailed the loss of his lovely wife, and implored the <lb/>
            assistance of the people, one of the robbers, moved with anger <lb/>
            at his persevering pursuit, snatched up a great stone, and <lb/>
            slew the unfortunate youth, my husband. It was this horrible <lb/>
            sight that aroused me in terror from my dreadful dream."</p>
          <p>Sighing in response to her tears, the old woman thus ad­ <lb/>

          <p>“ IN a certain city there lived a king and queen, who had three <lb/>
            daughters of remarkable beauty. The charms of the two elder <lb/>
            -and they were very great-were still thought not to exceed <lb/>
            all possible measure of praise ; but as for the youngest sister, <lb/>
            human speech was too poor to express, much less, adequately <lb/>
            to extol, her exquisite and surpassing loveliness. In fact, <lb/>
            multitudes of the citizens, and of strangers, whom the <lb/>
            fame of this extraordinary spectacle gathered to the spot, <lb/>
            were struck dumb with astonishment at her unapproachable <lb/>
            beauty, and moving their right hand to their lips, † with the <lb/>
            forefinger joining the elevated thumb, paid her religious adora­ <lb/>

          <p>"And now the tidings spread through the neighbouring <lb/>
            cities and adjacent countries that the goddess whom the azure <lb/>
            depths of the ocean had brought forth, and the spray of the <lb/>
            foamy billows had nurtured, dwelt in the midst of mortals, <lb/>
            and suffered them indiscriminately to behold her divine form; <lb/>
            or at least, that once again, impregnated by a new emanation' <lb/>
            from the starry heavens, not the sea, but the earth, had brought <lb/>
            forth another Venus, gifted with the flower of virginity. Thus <lb/>

            who, by long journeys over land, and over the deep sea, flocked <lb/>
            from all quarters to behold this glorious specimen of the age. <lb/>
            No one set sail for Paphos,* no one for Cnidus, nor even for <lb/>
            Cythera, to have sight of the goddess Venus. Her sacred <lb/>
            rites were abandoned, her temples suffered to decay, her <lb/>
            cushions † trampled under foot, her ceremonies neglected, her <lb/>
            statues left without chaplets, and her desolate altars defiled <lb/>
            with cold ashes. A young girl was supplicated in her stead, <lb/>
            and the divinity of the mighty goddess was worshipped under <lb/>
            human features; and the maiden was propitiated in herjnorn- <lb/>

            press her indignation, and shaking her head, in towering <lb/>
            wrath, she thus soliloquized: ‘ Behold how the primal parent <lb/>

          <p>“ Having thus said, and long and tenderly kissed her son, <lb/>
            she sought the neighbouring margin of the shore on which <note type="footnote"> the Gods and the World. ' In this fable, which is of the mixed kind, it <lb/>
            is said, that Discord, at a banquet of the Gods, threw a golden apple, and <lb/>
            that a dispute about it arising among the Goddesses, they were sent by <lb/>
            Jupiter to take the judgment of Paris, who, charmed with the beauty of <lb/>
            Venus, gave her the apple in preference to the rest. But the banquet de­ <lb/>
            notes the super-mundane powers of the Gods; and on this account they <lb/>
            subsist in conjunction with each other. And the golden apple denotes the <lb/>
            world, which, on account of its composition from contrary natures, is not <lb/>
            improperly said to be thrown by Discord, or strife. Again, however, since <lb/>
            different gifts are imparted to the world by different Gods, they appear to <lb/>
            contest with each other for the apple. And a soul living according to sense, <lb/>
            (for this is Paris), not perceiving other powers in the universe, says, that <lb/>
            the beauty of Venus alone is the contended apple.’—Taylor. </note><note type="footnote"> * Psyche to him.]- This was the Greek name for the soul; a moth <lb/>

            wish, appeared at once, as though she had previously com­ <lb/>

            upon a dolphin, and then troops of Tritons, furrowing the main <lb/>

            derived no advantage whatever from her good looks; she <lb/>
            was gazed on by all, praised by all, and yet no one, king, <lb/>
            noble, or plebeian even, came to woo her for his bride. They <lb/>
            admired, no doubt, her divine beauty, but then they all ad. <lb/>
            mired it as they would a statue exquisitely wrought. Long <lb/>
            before this, her two elder sisters, whose more moderate <lb/>
            charms had not been bruited abroad among the nations, had <lb/>
            been wooed by kings, and happily wedded to them; but <lb/>
            Psyche, forlorn virgin, sat at home,'bewailing her lonely condi­ <lb/>
            tion, faint in body and sick at heart; and hated her own <lb/>
            beauty, though it delighted all the rest of the world.</p>
          <p>"The wretched father of this most unfortunate daughter, sus­ <lb/>
            pecting the enmity of the gods, and dreading their wrath, con­ <lb/>
            sulted the very ancient oracle of the Milesian God, and sought <note type="footnote"> * Portunus.]—By Portunus here, or Portumnus, who, by the Greeks, <lb/>

            of that mighty divinity, with prayers and victims, a husband <lb/>
            for the maiden whom no one cared to have. But Apollo, <lb/>
            though a Grecian and an Ionian, by right of the founder of <lb/>
            Miletus, delivered an oracle in Latin verse to the following <lb/>
            effect: <lb/>
            ‘ Montis in Meets! scopulo desiste puellam <lb/>
            Ornatam mundo funerei thalami: <lb/>
            Nec speres generum mortal! stirpe creatum, <lb/>
            Sed sævum atque ferum, vipereumque malum ; <lb/>
            Qui, pinnis volitans super æthera, cuncta fatigat, <lb/>
            Flammaque et ferro singula debilitat; <lb/>
            Quern tremit ipse Jovis ; quo numina terrificantur ; <lb/>
            Flumina quern horrescunt, et Stygiæ tenebræ.’*</p>
          <p>“ The king, who had led a happy life till then, on hearing <lb/>
            the announcement of the sacred oracle, returned home sad and <lb/>
            slow, and disclosed to his wife the behests of inauspicious fate. <lb/>
            Many-days together were passed in grief and tears, and <lb/>
            lamentation. But time pressed, and the dire oracle had now <lb/>
            to be fulfilled. The procession was formed for the deadly <lb/>
            nuptials of the ill-fated maiden; the lighted torch burns ashy, <lb/>
            black, and sooty; the strains of Conjugal Juno's pipes are <lb/>
            changed for the plaintive Lydian melody; the joyful hyme­ <lb/>
            neal song sinks into a dismal wailing, and the bride wipes away <lb/>
            her tears with the nuptial veil † itself. The whole city groaned <lb/>
            in sympathy with the sad destiny of the afflicted family, and a <lb/>
            public mourning was immediately proclaimed.</p>
          <p>“ The necessity, however, of complying with the celestial <lb/>
            mandates, importunately called the wretched Psyche to her <note type="footnote"> Miletus, a city bordering on Ionia and Caria, and founded by a son of <lb/>

            doom. The solemn preliminaries, therefore, of this direful <lb/>
            marriage being completed in extreme sorrow, the funeral pro­ <lb/>
            cession of the living dead moves on, accompanied by all the <lb/>
            people; and the weeping Psyche walks not to her nuptials, but <lb/>
            to her obsequies. And while her woe-begone parents, over­ <lb/>
            whelmed with horror, strove to delay the execution of the <lb/>
            abominable deed, the daughter herself thus exhorted them to <lb/>
            compliance:</p>
          <p>" 1 Why torment your unfortunate old age with continual <lb/>
            weeping ? Why waste your breath, which is more dear to <lb/>
            me than to you, with repeated lamentations ? Why deform <lb/>
            your features, to me so venerable, with unavailing tears ? Why <lb/>
            lacerate my eyes in afflicting your own? Why tear your <lb/>
            hoary locks? Why beat your bosoms and those hallowed <lb/>
            breasts ? Are these to be the glorious results to you of my <lb/>
            surpassing beauty ? Too late do you perceive that you have <lb/>
            been smitten by the deadly shaft of envy. Alas ! then should <lb/>
            you have wept and lamented, then bewailed me as lost, when <lb/>
            tribes and nations celebrated me with divine honors, and when, <lb/>
            with one consent, they styled me a new-born Venus. Now <lb/>
            do I feel and see that through that name of Venus alone I <lb/>
            perish. Lead me away, then, and expose me on the rock to <lb/>
            which the 'oracle has devoted me; I am in haste to encounter <lb/>
            these auspicious nuptials; I am in haste to see this noble <lb/>
            bridegroom of mine.- Why should I delay ? Why avoid his <lb/>
            approach, who has been born for the destruction of the whole <lb/>
            world ?'</p>
          <p>" The maiden, after these words, said no more, but with un­ <lb/>
            faltering steps, took her place in the multitudinous procession. <lb/>
            They advanced to the destined rock on a lofty mountain, and <lb/>
            left the maiden alone on the summit; the nuptial torches, with <lb/>
            which they had lighted their way, were now extinguished <lb/>
            in their tears, and thrown aside, the ceremony was at an end, <lb/>
            and with drooping heads they took their homeward way. "As <lb/>
            for her wretched parents, sinking under the weight of a calamity <lb/>
            so great, they shut themselves up in their darkened palace, <lb/>
            and abandoned themselves to perpetual night. Meanwhile, <lb/>
            as Psyche lay trembling and weeping in dismay on the summit <lb/>
            of the rock, the mild breeze of the gently-blowing. Zephyr <lb/>
            played round her garments, fluttering and gradually expanding- <lb/>
            them till they lifted her up, and the god, wafting her with his <lb/>
             <pb n="90"/>
            tranquil breath adown the lofty mountain side, laid her softly <lb/>
            on the flowery turf in the lap of the valley." * <note type="footnote"> * The valley.]-The translation of this beautiful story would hardly <lb/>
            be complete were we to omit the following remarks on its various ex­ <lb/>
            planations, found in Air. Keightley’s valuable and entertaining ' Classical <lb/>
            Mythology.' " This beautiful fiction is evidently a philosophic allegory. <lb/>
            It seems to have been intended by its inventor for a representation of the <lb/>
            mystic union between the divine love and the human soul, and of the trials <lb/>
            and purifications which the latter must undergo, in order to be perfectly <lb/>
            fitted for an enduring union with the Divinity. It is thus explained by <lb/>
            the Christian mythologist Fulgentius : ' The city in which Psyche dwells <lb/>
            is the world; the king and queen are God and matter: Psyche is the <lb/>
            soul: her sisters are the flesh and the free-will; she is the youngest, be­ <lb/>
            cause the body is before the mind ; and she is the fairest, because the soul <lb/>
            is higher than free-will, more noble than the body. Venus, i. e. lust, envies <lb/>
            her, and sends Cupido, i. e. desire, to destroy her: but as there is desire <lb/>
            of good as well as of evil, Cupid falls in love with her; he persuades her <lb/>
            not to see his face, that is, not to learn the joys of desire. At the impul­ <lb/>
            sion of her sisters, she put the lamp from under the bushel that is, <lb/>
            reverted the flame of desire which was hidden in her bosom, and loved it <lb/>
            when she saw how delightful it was: and she is said to have burned it <lb/>
            by the dripping of the lamp, because all sin burns in proportion as it is <lb/>
            loved, and fixes its sinful marks on the flesh. She is, therefore, deprived <lb/>
            of desire and her splendid fortune, is exposed to perils, and driven out of <lb/>
            the palace." This fanciful exposition will probably not prove satisfactory <lb/>
            to all readers. The following one, of a modern writer, may seem to come <lb/>
            nearer the truth. " This fable, it is said, is a representation of the destiny <lb/>
            of the human soul. The soul, which is of Divine origin, is here below <lb/>
            subjected to error in its prison the body. Hence trials and purifications <lb/>
            are set before it, that it may become capable of a higher order of things, <lb/>
            and of true desire. Two loves meet it-the earthly, a deceiver, who draws <lb/>
            it down to earthly things ; the heavenly, who directs its view to the on. <lb/>
            ginal, fair and divine, and who, gaining the victory over his rival, leads off <lb/>
            the soul as his bride." According to a third expositor, the mythus is a <lb/>
            moral one. It is intended to represent the dangers to which nuptial <lb/>
            fidelity was exposed in such a degenerate country as Greece, and at the <lb/>
            same time to present an image of a fidelity exposed to numerous tempta­ <lb/>
            tions, and victorious over them all. We must not omit to observe that <lb/>
            Psyche (<foreign xml:lang="grc">Ψυχὴ</foreign>) was also a Greek name for the moth. The fondness of this <lb/>
            insect for approaching at night the flame of the lamp or candle, in which <lb/>
            it so frequently finds its death, reminds a mystic philosopher of the fate of <lb/>
            the soul destroyed by the desire of knowledge, or absorbed and losing its <lb/>
            separate existence in the Deity, who dwelt in light, according to the phi­ <lb/>
            losophy of the East. But, further, the world presents no illustration so <lb/>
            striking or so beautiful, of the immortality of the soul, as that of the moth <lb/>
            or butterfly, bursting on brilliant wings from the dull grovelling caterpillar <lb/>
            state in which it had previously existed, fluttering in the blaze of day, and <lb/>
            feeding on the most fragrant and sweetest productions of the spring. Hence </note> <pb n="91"/>

          <p>“ PSYCHE, therefore, delightfully reclining in this pleasant and <lb/>
            grassy spot, upon a bed of dewy herbage, felt her extreme <lb/>
            agitation of mind allayed, and sank into a sweet sleep, from <lb/>
            which she awoke refreshed in body, and with a mind more <lb/>
            composed. She then espied a grove, thick planted with vast <lb/>
            and lofty trees ; she likewise saw a fountain in the middle <lb/>
            of the grove, with water limpid as crystal. Near the fall of <lb/>
            the fountain there was a kingly palace, not raised by human <lb/>
            hands, but by divine skill. You might know, from the <lb/>
            very entrance of the palace, that you were looking upon the <lb/>
            splendid and delightful abode of some God. For the lofty <lb/>
            ceilings, curiously arched with cedar and ivory, were sup­ <lb/>
            ported by golden columns. The walls were encrusted all <lb/>
            over with silver carving, with wild beasts and domestic ani­ <lb/>
            mals of all kinds, presenting themselves to the view of those <lb/>
            who entered the palace. A wonderful man was he, a demigod, <lb/>
            nay, surely, a god, who with such exquisite subtlety of art, <lb/>
            moulded such vast quantities of silver into various <unclear>ferine</unclear> <lb/>
            forms.</p>
          <p>" The very pavement itself consisted of precious stones cut out <lb/>
            and arranged so as to form pictures of divers kinds.' Blessed, <lb/>
            thrice blessed, those who can tread gems and bracelets under <lb/>
            foot! The other parts, as well, of this palace of vast extent, <lb/>
            were precious beyond all computation; and the walls being <lb/>
            everywhere strengthened with bars of gold, shone with their <note type="footnote"> it was, in all probability, that the Greeks named the butterfly the soul, <lb/>
            A correspondent of the Notes and Queries remarks of this story (vol. ii. <lb/>
            p. 29)—‘ This is probably an old Folk-tale, originally, perhaps an antique <lb/>
            philosophical temple-allegory. Apuleius appears only to have dressed it <lb/>
            up in a new shape. The tale is still current, but in a form not derived <lb/>
            from him, among the Swedes, Norwegians, Danes, Scots, Germans, French, <lb/>
            Wallachians, Italians, and Hindoos.' </note> <lb/>

            own lustre, so that even were the sun to withhold his light, <lb/>
            the palace could make for itself a day of its own; so effulgent <lb/>
            were the chambers, the porticos, and the doors. The furni­ <lb/>
            ture, too, was on a scale commensurate with the majesty of <lb/>
            this abode ; so that it might well be looked upon as a palace <lb/>
            built by mighty Jove, where he might dwell among mankind.</p>
          <p>" Invited by the delightful appearance of the place, Pysche <lb/>
            approached it, and, gradually taking courage, stepped over the <lb/>
            threshold. The beauty of what she beheld lured her on, and <lb/>
            everything filled her with admiration. In another part of the <lb/>
            palace, she beheld magnificent repositories, stored with im­ <lb/>
            mense riches; nothing, in fact, is there which was not there <lb/>
            to be found. But besides the admiration which such enormous <lb/>
            wealth excited, this was particularly surprising, that this <lb/>
            treasury of the universal world was protected by no chain, no <lb/>
            bar, no guard.</p>
          <p>" Here, while Psyche's gaze was ravished with delight, a <lb/>
            bodiless voice thus addressed her; ' Why, lady,' it said, ‘ are <lb/>
            you astonished at such vast riches ? All are yours. Betake <lb/>
            yourself, therefore, to your chamber, and refresh your wearied <lb/>
            limbs on your couch, and, when you think proper, repair to <lb/>
            the bath; for we, whose voices you now hear, are your hand­ <lb/>
            maidens, and will carefully attend to all your commands, and, <lb/>
            when we have dressed you, a royal banquet will be placed be­ <lb/>
            fore you without delay.'</p>
          <p>Psyche was sensible of the goodness of divine providence, <lb/>
            and, obedient to the admonitions of the unembodied voices, <lb/>
            relieved her fatigue, first with sleep, and afterwards with the <lb/>
            bath. After this, perceiving, close at hand, a semicircular dais <lb/>
            with a raised seat, and what seemed to be the apparatus for a <lb/>
            banquet, intended for her refreshment, she readily took her <lb/>
            place; whereupon nectareous wines, and numerous dishes <lb/>
            containing various kinds of dainties, were immediately served <lb/>
            up, impelled, as it seemed, by some spiritual impulse, for <lb/>
            there were no visible attendants. Not one human being could <lb/>
            she see, she only heard words that were uttered, and had voices <lb/>
            alone for her servants. After an exquisite banquet was served <lb/>
            up, some one entered, and sang unseen, while another struck <lb/>
            the lyre, which was no more visible than himself. Then, a <lb/>
            swell of voices, as of a multitude singing in full chorus, was <lb/>
            wafted to her ears, though not one of the vocalists could she <lb/>
            descry.</p><pb n="93"/>
            
          <p><note type="margin">BOOK V. </note> " After these delights had ceased, the evening now persuading <lb/>
            to repose, Psyche retired to bed: and when the night was far <lb/>
            advanced, a certain gentle, murmuring sound fell upon her ears. <lb/>
            Then alarmed for her honor, in consequence of the profound <lb/>
            solitude of the place, she trembled and was filled with terror, <lb/>
            and dreaded that of which she was ignorant more than any <lb/>
            misfortune. And now her unknown bridegroom ascended the <lb/>
            couch, made Psyche his wife, and hastily left her before break <lb/>
            of day. Immediately the attendant voices of the bedchamber <lb/>
            came to aid the wounded modesty of the new-made bride. <lb/>
            This course was continued for a length of time ; and, as by <lb/>
            nature it has been so ordained, the novelty, by its constant <lb/>
            repetition, afforded her delight, and the sound of the voices <lb/>
            was the solace of her solitude.</p>
          <p>“ In the meantime, her parents were wasting their old age <lb/>
            in sorrow and lamentation; and the report of her fate, be­ <lb/>
            coming more widely extended, her elder sisters had learnt all <lb/>
            the particulars; whereupon leaving their homes in deep grief, <lb/>
            they hastened to visit and comfort their parents. On that <lb/>
            night, did Psyche's husband thus address her-for she could <lb/>
            discern his presence with her ears and hands, though not with <lb/>
            her eyes:</p>
          <p>" ' Most charming Psyche, dear wife, cruel fortune now <lb/>
            threatens you with a deadly peril, which needs, I think, to be <lb/>
            guarded against with the most vigilant attention. For ere <lb/>
            long, your sisters, who are alarmed at the report of your <lb/>
            death, in their endeavours to discover traces of you, will arrive <lb/>
            at yonder rock. If, then, you should chance to hear their <lb/>
            lamentations, make them no reply, no, nor even so much as <lb/>
            turn your eyes towards them. By doing otherwise, you will <lb/>
            cause most grievous sorrow to me, and utter destruction to <lb/>
            yourself.'</p>
          <p>" Psyche assented, and promised that she would act agreeably <lb/>
            to her husband's desire. But when he and the night had de­ <lb/>
            parted together, the poor thing consumed the whole day in tears <lb/>
            and lamentations, exclaiming over and over again, that she was <lb/>
            now utterly lost, since, besides being thus confined in a splen­ <lb/>
            did prison, deprived of human conversation, she was not even <lb/>
            allowed to relieve the minds of her sisters, who were sorrowing <lb/>
            for her, nor, indeed, so much as to see them. Without having <lb/>
            refreshed herself, therefore, with the bath or with food, or, in <lb/>
             <pb n="94"/>
            fact, with any solace whatever, but weeping plenteously, sha <lb/>
            retired to rest. Shortly afterwards, her husband, coming to <lb/>
            her bed earlier than usual, embraced her as she wept, and thus <lb/>
            expostulated with her:</p>
          <p>" 'Is this, my Psyche, what you promised me ? What am <lb/>
            I, your husband, henceforth to expect of you ? What can I <lb/>
            now hope for, when neither by day nor by night, not even in <lb/>
            the midst of our conjugal endearments, you cease to be dis­ <lb/>
            tracted with grief? Very well, then, act now just as you <lb/>
            please, and comply with the baneful dictates of your inclina­ <lb/>
            tion. However, when you begin too late to repent, you will <lb/>
            recall to mind my serious admonitions.'</p>
          <p>" Upon this, she had recourse to prayers; and threatening <lb/>
            that she would put an end to herself if her request were de­ <lb/>
            nied, she extorted from her husband a consent that she might <lb/>
            see her sisters, to soothe their grief, and enjoy their con­ <lb/>
            versation. This he yielded to the entreaties of his new-made <lb/>
            wife, and he gave her permission, besides, to present her sis­ <lb/>
            ters with as much gold and as many jewels as she pleased; <lb/>
            but he warned her repeatedly and so often as to terrify her, <lb/>
            never, on any occasion, to be persuaded by the pernicious advice <lb/>
            of her sisters, to make any enquiries concerning the form of her <lb/>
            husband; lest by a sacrilegious curiosity, she might cast her­ <lb/>
            self down from such an exalted position of good fortune, and <lb/>
            never again feel his embraces.</p>
          <p>“ She thanked her husband for his indulgence; and now, <lb/>
            having quite recovered her spirits, 'Nay,' said she, ‘ I would <lb/>
            suffer death a hundred times rather than be deprived of your <lb/>
            most delightful company, for I love you, yes, I do at upon <lb/>
            you to desperation, whoever you are, ay, even as I love my <lb/>
            own soul, nor would I give you in exchange for Cupid him­ <lb/>
            self. But this also I beseech you to grant to my prayers; bid <lb/>
            Zephyr, this servant of yours, convey my sisters to me, in the <lb/>
            same manner in which he brought me hither.' Then, pressing <lb/>
            his lips with persuasive kisses, murmuring endearing words, <lb/>
            and enfolding him with her clinging limbs, she called him <lb/>
            coaxingly, 'My sweet, my husband, dear soul of thy Psyche.' <lb/>
            Her husband, overcome by the power of love, yielded reluc­ <lb/>
            tantly, and promised all she desired. After this, upon the <lb/>
            approach of morning, he again vanished from the arms of his <lb/>
            wife.</p><pb n="95"/>
            
          <p><note type="margin">BOOK V. </note> " Meanwhile, the sisters, having inquired the way to the rock <lb/>
            on which Psyche was abandoned, hastened thither; and there <lb/>
            they wept and beat their breasts till the rocks and crags re­ <lb/>
            sounded with their lamentations. They called to their unfor­ <lb/>
            tunate sister, by her own name, until the shrill sound of their <lb/>
            shrieks descending the declivities of the mountain, reached the <lb/>
            ears of Psyche, who ran out of her palace in delirious trepi­ <lb/>
            dation, and exclaimed:</p>
          <p>" 1 Why do you needlessly afflict yourselves with doleful <lb/>
            lamentations ? Here am I, whom you mourn; cease those <lb/>
            dismal accents, and now at last dry up those tears that have so <lb/>
            long bedewed your cheeks, since you may now embrace her <lb/>
            whom you have been lamenting.'</p>
          <p>" Then, summoning Zephyr, she acquaints him with her hus­ <lb/>
            band's commands, in obedience to which, instantly wafting <lb/>
            them on his gentlest breeze, he safely conveyed them to Psyche. <lb/>
            Now do they enjoy mutual embraces, and hurried kisses ; and <lb/>
            their tears, that had ceased to flow, return, after a time, sum­ <lb/>
            moned forth by joy. 'Now come,' said Psyche, ‘enter my <lb/>
            dwelling in gladness, and cheer up your afflicted spirits with <lb/>
            your Psyche.' Having thug said, she showed them the vast <lb/>
            treasures of her golden palace, made their ears acquainted <lb/>
            with the numerous retinue of voices that were obedient to her <lb/>
            commands, and sumptuously refreshed them in a most beauti­ <lb/>
            ful bath, and with the delicacies of a divine banquet; until, <lb/>
            satiated with this copious abundance of celestial riches, they <lb/>
            began to nourish envy in the lowest depths of their breasts. <lb/>
            One of them, especially, very minute and curious, persisted in <lb/>
            making enquiries about the master of this celestial wealth, <lb/>
            what kind of person, and what sort of husband he made.</p>
          <p>" Psyche, however, would by no means violate her husband's <lb/>
            injunctions, or disclose the secrets of her breast; but, de­ <lb/>
            vising a tale for the occasion, told them that he was a young <lb/>
            man, and very good looking, with cheeks as yet only shaded <lb/>
            with soft down, and that he was, for the most part, engaged <lb/>
            in rural occupations, and hunting on the mountains. And <lb/>
            lest, by any slip in the course of the protracted conversation, <lb/>
            her secret counsels might be betrayed, having loaded them <lb/>
            with ornaments of gold and jewelled necklaces, she called <lb/>
            Zephyr, and ordered him at once to convey them- back again.</p>
          <p>" This being immediately executed, these excellent sisters, <lb/>
             <pb n="96"/>
            as they were returning home, now burning more and more <lb/>
            with the rancour of envy, conversed much with each other; <lb/>
            at last one of them thus began: “Do but see how blind, cruel, <lb/>
            and unjust, Fortune has proved! Were you, my sister, de­ <lb/>
            lighted to find that we, born of the same parents, had met <lb/>
            with such a different lot ? We, indeed, who are the elder, are <lb/>
            delivered over as bondmaids* to foreign husbands, and live in <lb/>
            banishment from our home, our native land, and our parents; <lb/>
            and this, the youngest of us all, the last production of our <lb/>
            mother's exhausted powers of parturition, is raised to the en­ <lb/>
            joyment of such boundless wealth, and has a god for her hus­ <lb/>
            band, she who does not even know how to enjoy, in a proper <lb/>
            manner, such an abundance of blessings ? You saw, sister, <lb/>
            what a vast number of necklaces there were in the house, and <lb/>
            of what enormous value, what splendid dresses, what brilliant <lb/>
            gems, and what heaps of gold she treads upon in every direc­ <lb/>
            tion. If, besides all this, she possesses a husband so handsome <lb/>
            as she asserts him to be, there lives not in the whole world a <lb/>
            happier woman than she. Perhaps, however, upon continued <lb/>
            acquaintance, and when his affection is strengthened, her hus­ <lb/>
            band, who is a god, will make her a goddess as well. By <lb/>
            Hercules! it is so already; she comported and demeaned herself <lb/>
            just like one: the woman must needs assume a lofty bearing, <lb/>
            and give herself the airs of a goddess, who has voices for her <lb/>
            attendants, and commands the very winds themselves. But I, <lb/>
            wretched creature, am tied to a husband who, in the first place, <lb/>
            is older than my father; and who, in the next place, is balder <lb/>
            than a pumpkin, and more dwarfish than any boy, and who <lb/>
            fastens up every part of his house with bolts and chains.'</p>
          <p>" ' But I,' replied the other sister, 'have got to put up with <lb/>
            a husband who is tormented and crippled with gout; and who, <lb/>
            on this account, seldom honours me with his embraces, while <lb/>
            I have to be everlastingly rubbing his distorted and chalky <lb/>
            fingers with filthy fomentations, nasty rags, and stinking poul­ <lb/>
            tices ; scalding these delicate hands, and acting the part not of <note type="footnote"> * Over as bondmaids.]-It was a prevalent notion with many of the an­ <lb/>
            cients, that the wife stood towards the husband in relation of a bondmaid. <lb/>
            In reference to this notion, Isidore, in his Origines, b. iv. c. 21, informs <lb/>
            us, ' One of the ceremonies of marriage anciently was this ; the husband <lb/>
            and the wife purchased each other, in order that the latter might not be <lb/>
            considered as a servant.' </note> <pb n="97"/>

            ft wife, but of a female doctor. You, sister, seem to bear all <lb/>
            this with a patient, or rather a servile spirit, for I shall speak <lb/>
            out fully what I think; but, for my part, I can no longer en. <lb/>
            dure that such a fortunate destiny should have so undeservedly <lb/>
            fallen to her lot. And then, recollect in what a haughty and <lb/>
            arrogant manner she behaved towards us, and how, by her boast­ <lb/>
            ing and immoderate ostentation, she betrayed a heart swelling <lb/>
            with pride, and how reluctantly she threw us a trifling portion <lb/>
            of her immense riches; and immediately after, being weary of <lb/>
            our company, ordered us to be turned out, and to be puffed and <lb/>
            whisked away. But may I be no woman, nor indeed may I <lb/>
            breathe, if I do not hurl her down headlong from such mighty <lb/>
            wealth. And if this contumely offered to us stings you, too, <lb/>
            as it ought, let us both join in forming some effective plan. <lb/>
            In the first place, then, let us not show these things that we <lb/>
            have got, either to our parents or to any one else ; in fact, we <lb/>
            are to know nothing at all about her safety. It is quite enough <lb/>
            that we ourselves have seen what it vexes us to have seen, <lb/>
            without having to spread the report of her good fortune among <lb/>
            our parents and all the people; for, in fact, those persons are <lb/>
            not wealthy whose riches no one is acquainted with. She <lb/>
            shall know that in us she has got no handmaids, but elder sis­ <lb/>
            ters. For the present, then, let-us away to our husbands, and <lb/>
            revisit our poor and plain dwellings, that after long and <lb/>
            earnest consideration, we may return the better prepared to <lb/>
            humble her pride.'</p>
          <p>“ This wicked project was voted good by the two wicked <lb/>
            sisters. Concealing those choice and sumptuous presents which <lb/>
            they had received from Psyche, tearing their hair, and beating <lb/>
            their faces, which well deserved such treatment, they redoubled <lb/>
            their pretended grief. In this manner, too, hastily leaving <lb/>
            their parents, after having set their sorrows bleeding afresh, <lb/>
            they returned to their homes, swelling with malicious rage, and <lb/>
            plotting wicked schemes, nay, actual parricide against their <lb/>
            innocent sister.</p>
          <p>" In the mean time, Psyche's unknown husband once more <lb/>
            admonished her thus in their nocturnal conversation: ' Are <lb/>
            you aware what a mighty peril Fortune is preparing to launch <lb/>
            against you from a distance, one too, which, unless you take <lb/>
            strenuous precautions against it, will ere long confront you,* <note type="footnote"> * Confront you.] —' Velitatur,’ This is a metaphorical expression. </note> <note type="footnote"> H </note> <lb/>

            hand to hand ? Those perfidious she-wolves are planning base <lb/>
            stratagems against you with all their might, to the end that <lb/>
            they may prevail upon you to view my features, which, as I <lb/>
            have often told you, if you once see, you will see no more. If, <lb/>
            then, these most abominable vampires* come again, armed with <lb/>
            their baneful intentions, and that they will come I know full <lb/>
            well, do not hold any converse whatever with them; but if, <lb/>
            through your natural frankness and tenderness of disposition, <lb/>
            you are not able to do this, at all events, be careful not to listen <lb/>
            to or answer any inquiries about your husband. For before <lb/>
            long we shall have an increase to our family, and infantine as <lb/>
            you are, you are pregnant with another infant, which, if you <lb/>
            preserve my secret in silence, will be born divine, but if you <lb/>
            profane it, will be mortal!</p>
          <p>"Radiant with joy at this news, Psyche exulted in the <lb/>
            glory of this future pledge of love, and in the dignity of a <lb/>
            mother's name. Anxiously did she reckon the increasing tale <lb/>
            of the days and the elapsing months, and wondered in simple <lb/>
            ignorance at the structure of this unknown burden, and how <lb/>
            her wealthy womb could have gathered such an increase from <lb/>
            a tiny point.</p>
          <p>" But now those pests and most dire Furies, breathing <lb/>
            viperous virulence, were hastening towards her with the speed <lb/>
            of ruthless hate. Then again her husband warned his Psyche <lb/>
            to this effect during his brief visit:-, The day of trial, and <lb/>
            this most utter calamity, are now at hand. Your own mali­ <lb/>
            cious sex, and your own blood, in arms against you, have <lb/>
            struck their camp, drawn up their forces in battle array, and <lb/>
            sounded the charge. Now are your wicked sisters aiming <lb/>
            with the drawn sword at your throat. Alas! darling Psyche, <lb/>
            by what mighty dangers are we now surrounded! Take pity <lb/>
            on yourself and on me; and by an inviolable silence, rescue <lb/>
            your home, your husband, yourself, and that little one of <lb/>
            ours, from this impending destruction. Shun those wicked <lb/>
            women, whom, after the deadly hatred which they have con­ <lb/>
            ceived against you, and having trampled under foot the ties <lb/>
            of blood, it were not right to call sisters; neither see, nor <note type="footnote"> taken from the mode of attack by the ' velites,' or light-armed infantry, <lb/>
            who sent their darts and arrows from a distance. </note><note type="footnote"> * Abominable vampires.]-‘ Lamiæ.’ These witches, or hags, have been <lb/>

            listen to them, when, like Sirens, hanging over the crag, they <lb/>
            shall make the rocks resound with their ill-omened voices.'</p>
          <p>" Psyche, in accents interrupted by sobs and tears, thus re­ <lb/>
            plied : ‘Already, methinks, you have experienced convincing <lb/>
            proofs of my fidelity and power of keeping a secret; and the <lb/>
            constancy of my mind shall be no less approved of by you in the <lb/>
            present instance. Only order Zephyr once again to discharge <lb/>
            his duties, and at least grant me a sight of my sisters, by way <lb/>
            of compensation, for your own hallowed form. By those aro­ <lb/>
            matic locks, curling on every side! by those cheeks, tender, <lb/>
            smooth, and so like my own! by your breast that- glows with <lb/>
            I know not what a warmth! and by my hopes that in this <lb/>
            babe at least I may- recognise your features, I beseech you to <lb/>
            comply with the affectionate prayers of your anxious sup­ <lb/>
            pliant; indulge me with the gratification of embracing my <lb/>
            sisters, and refresh with joyousness the soul of Psyche, who is <lb/>
            so devoted and so dear to you. Then no longer I shall be <lb/>
            anxious to view your features. Henceforth, not even the <lb/>
            shades of night will have any effect on me. I clasp you in my <lb/>
            arms, and you are my light.'</p>
          <p>“ Enchanted by these words, and by her honeyed embraces, <lb/>
            her husband brushed away her tears with his locks, and as­ <lb/>
            suring her that he would do as she wished, instantly anti­ <lb/>
            cipated the light of the dawning day by flight. But the pair <lb/>
            of sisters who had engaged in this conspiracy, not having so <lb/>
            much as visited their parents, direct their course with precipi­ <lb/>
            tate haste straight from the ships towards the rock, and not <lb/>
            waiting for the presence of the buoyant breeze, leap into the <lb/>
            abyss with ungovernable rashness. Zephyr, however, not for­ <lb/>
            getful of the royal commands, received them, though reluc­ <lb/>
            tantly, in the bosom of the breathing breeze, and laid them on <lb/>
            the ground.</p>
          <p>" With rapid steps and without a moment's delay, they <lb/>
            entered the palace, and deceitfully screening themselves under <lb/>
            the name of sister, embraced their prey; then, covering a <lb/>
            whole store-house of deeply hidden treachery beneath a joyous <lb/>
            countenance, they thus addressed her in flattering terms: <lb/>
            'Psyche, you are not quite so slender as you used to be. <lb/>
            Why, you will be a mother before long. Can you fancy what <lb/>
            delight you have in store for us in that reticule* of yours ? <note type="footnote"> * In that reticule.]—‘Perula.’ Her womb. </note> <note type="footnote"> n 2 </note> <lb/>

            With what exceeding joy you will gladden our whole house! <lb/>
            0 how delighted we shall be to nurse this golden baby, for if <lb/>
            it only equals the beauty of its parents, it will be born a per­ <lb/>
            fect Cupid.'</p>
          <p>" Thus, by a false appearance of affection, they gradually stole <lb/>
            upon the heart of their sister, while she, after making them sit <lb/>
            awhile to recover from the fatigue of their journey and re­ <lb/>
            fresh themselves with warm baths, regaled them in a marvel­ <lb/>
            lously splendid manner with innumerable exquisite dainties. <lb/>
            She bade the harp discourse, and its chords were struck; flutes <lb/>
            to play, and they were heard; vocalists to sing in concert, and <lb/>
            they sang; and though invisible, they ravished the souls of <lb/>
            the hearers with the most delicious music.</p>
          <p>" But the malice of those wicked women was not softened or <lb/>
            lulled to rest even by the dulcet sweetness of the music; but, <lb/>
            shaping their conversation so as to lead Psyche into the in­ <lb/>
            tended snare, they began insidiously to inquire what sort of <lb/>
            a person her husband was, and from what family he was <lb/>
            descended. She, in her extreme simplicity, having forgotten <lb/>
            her former account, invented a new story about her husband, <lb/>
            and said he was a native of the adjoining province; that he <lb/>
            was a merchant, with abundance of money, a man of middle <lb/>
            age, with a few grey hairs sprinkled here and there on his <lb/>
            head. Then, abruptly terminating the conversation, she again <lb/>
            committed them to their windy vehicle, after having loaded <lb/>
            them with costly presents.</p>
          <p>“While they were returning home wards, soaring aloft on <lb/>
            the tranquil breath of Zephyrus, they thus interchanged their <lb/>
            thoughts with each other: ‘ What are we to say, sister, of the <lb/>
            monstrous lies of that silly creature ? At one time her hus­ <lb/>
            band is a young man, with the down just beginning to show <lb/>
            itself on his chin; at another he is of middle age, and his hair <lb/>
            begins to be silvered with grey. Who can. this be, whom a <lb/>
            short space of time thus suddenly changes into an old man ? <lb/>
            You may depend upon it, sister, that this most abominable <lb/>
            woman has either invented this lie to deceive us, or else that <lb/>
            she does not herself know what is the appearance of her hus­ <lb/>
            band. But whichever of these is the case, she must as soon as <lb/>
            possible be deprived of these riches. And yet, if she really is <lb/>
            ignorant of the appearance of her husband, she must no doubt <lb/>
            have married a god, and then through this pregnancy of hers. <pb n="101"/>
            <note type="margin"> BOOK V. </note> <lb/>
            phe will be presenting us with a god. At all events, if she <lb/>
            does happen, which heaven forbid! to become the mother of a <lb/>
            divine infant, I shall instantly hang myself. Let us therefore <lb/>
            in the meantime return to our parents, and let us devise some <lb/>
            scheme, as nearly as possible in accordance with the import of <lb/>
            our present conversation.'</p>
          <p>“ The sisters, thus inflamed with passion, called on their <lb/>
            parents in a careless and disdainful manner, and after being <lb/>
            kept awake all night by the turbulence of their spirits, made <lb/>
            all haste at morning to the rock, whence, by the usual assist­ <lb/>
            ance of the breeze, they descended swiftly to Psyche, and with <lb/>
            tears squeezed out, by rubbing their eyelids, thus craftily ad­ <lb/>
            dressed her: ‘ Happy indeed are you, and fortunate in your <lb/>
            very ignorance of a misfortune of such magnitude. There you <lb/>
            sit, without a thought upon your danger; while we, who watch <lb/>
            over your interests with the most vigilant care, are in anguish <lb/>
            at your lost condition. For we have learned for a truth, nor <lb/>
            can we, as being sharers in your sorrows and misfortunes, <lb/>
            conceal it from you, that it is an enormous serpent, gliding <lb/>
            along in many folds and coils, with a neck swollen with <lb/>
            deadly venom, and prodigious gaping jaws, that secretly sleeps <lb/>
            with you by night. Do for a moment recall to mind the <lb/>
            Pythian oracle, which declared that you were destined to be­ <lb/>
            come the wife of a fierce and truculent animal. Besides, many <lb/>
            of the husbandmen, who are in the habit of hunting all round <lb/>
            the country, and ever so many of the neighbours, have observed <lb/>
            him returning home from his feeding-place in the evening, <lb/>
            and swimming across the shoals of the neighbouring stream. <lb/>
            All declare, too, that he will not long continue to pamper you <lb/>
            with delicacies, but that as soon as ever your pregnancy shall <lb/>
            have arrived at maturity, he will devour you, as being in that <lb/>
            state a most exquisite morsel. Wherefore, it is now for you to <lb/>
            consider whether you shall think fit to listen to us, who are so <lb/>
            anxious for your precious safety, and avoiding death, live with <lb/>
            us secure from danger, or be buried in the entrails of a most <lb/>
            savage monster. But if you are fascinated by the vocal solitude <lb/>
            of this country retreat, or the charms of clandestine embraces <lb/>
            so filthy and perilous, and the endearments of a poisonous ser­ <lb/>
            pent, we have, at all events, done our duty towards you like <lb/>
            affectionate sisters.'</p>
          <p>" Poor simple, tender-hearted Psyche, was aghast with <lb/>
             <pb n="102"/>
            norror at this dreadful story; and, quite bereft of her senses, <lb/>
            lost all remembrance of her husband's admonitions and of her <lb/>
            own promises, and hurled herself headlong into the very abyss <lb/>
            of calamity. Trembling, therefore, with pale and livid cheeks, <lb/>
            and with an almost lifeless voice, she faltered out these broken <lb/>
            words:</p>
          <p>" ' Dearest sisters, you have acted towards me as you ought, <lb/>
            and with your usual affectionate care; and indeed it appears to <lb/>
            me that those who gave you this information, have not in­ <lb/>
            vented a falsehood. For, in fact, I have never yet beheld my <lb/>
            husband's face, nor do I know at all whence he comes. I only <lb/>
            hear him speak in an undertone by night, and have to bear <lb/>
            with a husband of an unknown appearance, and one that has <lb/>
            an utter aversion to the light of day: I consequently have full <lb/>
            reason to be of your opinion, that he may be some monster or <lb/>
            other. Besides, he is always terrifying me from attempting to <lb/>
            behold him, and threatens some shocking misfortune as the <lb/>
            consequence of indulging any curiosity to view his features. <lb/>
            Now, therefore, if you are able to give any saving aid to your <lb/>
            sister in this perilous emergency, defer it not for a moment:</p>
          <p>“ Finding the approaches thus laid open, and their sister's <lb/>
            heart exposed all naked to their attacks, these wicked women <lb/>
            thought the time was come to sally out from their covered ap­ <lb/>
            proach, and attack the timorous thoughts of the simple girl with <lb/>
            the drawn sword of deceit. Accordingly, one of them thus be­ <lb/>
            gan : ' Since the ties of blood oblige us to have no fear of peril <lb/>
            before our eyes when your safety is to be ensured, we will dis­ <lb/>
            cover to you the only method which will lead to your preserva­ <lb/>
            tion, and one which has been considered by us over and over <lb/>
            again. On that side of the bed where you are accustomed to lie, <lb/>
            secretly conceal a very sharp razor, one that you have whetted <lb/>
            to a keen edge by passing it over the palm of your hand; and <lb/>
            hide likewise under some covering of the surrounding tapestry* <lb/>
            a lamp, well trimmed and full of oil, and shining with a bright <lb/>
            light. Make these preparations with the utmost secrecy, and <lb/>
            after the monster has glided into the bed as usual, when he is <lb/>
            now stretched out at length, fast asleep, and breathing heavily, <lb/>
            then slide out of bed, go softly along with bare feet and on <lb/>
            tiptoe, free the lamp from its place of concealment in the dark, <note type="footnote"> * Surrounding tapestry.]—‘Auleæ’ seems a preferable reading uere to <lb/>
            ' Aululæ.’ </note> <pb n="103"/>
            <note type="margin"> BOOK V. </note> <lb/>
            and borrow the aid of its light to execute your noble purpose; <lb/>
            then at once, boldly raising your right hand, bring down the <lb/>
            keen weapon with all your might, and cut off the head of the <lb/>
            noxious serpent at the nape of the neck. Nor shall our assist­ <lb/>
            ance be wanting to you; for we will keep anxious watch, and <lb/>
            be with you the very instant you shall have effected your own <lb/>
            safety by his death; and then, immediately bringing you away <lb/>
            with all these things, we will wed you, to your wish, with a <lb/>
            human creature like yourself.</p>
          <p>" Having with such pernicious language inflamed the mind <lb/>
            of their sister, and wrought her to a perfect pitch of determi­ <lb/>
            nation, they deserted her, fearing exceedingly even to be in the <lb/>
            neighbourhood of such a catastrophe; and, being laid upon the <lb/>
            rock by the wonted impulse of their winged bearer, they im­ <lb/>
            mediately hurried thence witli impetuous haste, at once got on <lb/>
            board their ships, and sailed away.</p>
          <p>“But Psyche, now left alone, except so far as a person who is <lb/>
            agitated by maddening Furies is not alone, fluctuated in sorrow <lb/>
            like a stormy sea; and though her purpose was fixed, and her <lb/>
            heart was resolute when she first began to make preparations <lb/>
            for the impious work, her mind now wavers, and is distracted <lb/>
            with numerous apprehensions at her unhappy fate. She <lb/>
            hurries, she procrastinates; now she is bold, now tremulous; <lb/>
            now dubious, now agitated by rage; and what is the most <lb/>
            singular thing of all, in the same being she hates the beast, <lb/>
            — loves the husband. Nevertheless, as the evening drew to a <lb/>
            close, she hurriedly prepared the instruments of her ruthless <lb/>
            enterprise.</p>
          <p>" The night came, and with it came her husband, and after <lb/>
            their first dalliance was over, he fell into a deep sleep. Then <lb/>
            Psyche, to whose weak body and spirit the cruel influence of <lb/>
            fate imparted unusual strength, uncovered the lamp, and <lb/>
            seized the knife with masculine courage. But the instant she <lb/>
            advanced the lamp, and the mysteries of the couch stood re­ <lb/>
            vealed, she beheld the very gentlest and sweetest of all wild <lb/>
            creatures, even Cupid himself, the beautiful God of Love, there <lb/>
            fast asleep; at sight of whom, the joyous flame of the lamp <lb/>
            shone with redoubled vigour, and the sacrilegious razor re­ <lb/>
            pented the keenness of its edge. '</p>
          <p>" But as for Psyche, astounded at such a sight, losing the <lb/>
            control of her senses, faint, deadly pale, and trembling all <lb/>
             <pb n="104"/>
            over, she fell on her knees, and made an attempt to hide the <lb/>
            blade in her own bosom; and this no doubt she would have <lb/>
            done, had not the blade, dreading the commission of such a <lb/>
            crime, glided out of her rash hand. And now, faint and un­ <lb/>
            nerved as she was, she feels herself refreshed at heart by <lb/>
            gazing upon the beauty of those divine features. She looks upon <lb/>
            the genial locks of his golden head, teeming with ambrosial <lb/>
            perfume, the orbed curls that strayed over his milk-white neck <lb/>
            and roseate cheeks, and fell gracefully entangled, some before, <lb/>
            some, behind ; causing the very light of the lamp itself to flicker <lb/>
            by their radiant splendour. On the shoulders of the volatile <lb/>
            god were dewy wings of brilliant whiteness; and though the <lb/>
            pinions were at rest, yet the tender down that fringed the <lb/>
            feathers wantoned to and fro in tremulous unceasing play. <lb/>
            The rest of his body was smooth and beautiful, and such as <lb/>
            Venus could not have repented of giving birth to. At the foot <lb/>
            of the bed lay his bow, his quiver, and his arrows, the auspi­ <lb/>
            cious weapons of the mighty God.</p>
          <p>" While with insatiable wonder and curiosity Psyche is ex­ <lb/>
            amining and admiring her husband's weapons, she draws one <lb/>
            of the arrows out of the quiver, and touches the point with the <lb/>
            tip of her thumb to try its sharpness; but happening to press <lb/>
            too hard, for her hand still trembled, she punctured the skin, <lb/>
            so that some tiny drops of rosy blood oozed forth ; and thus <lb/>
            did Psyche, without knowing it, fall in love with LOVE. Then, <lb/>
            burning more and more with desire for Cupid, gazing passion­ <lb/>
            ately, on his face, and fondly kissing him again and again, her <lb/>
            only fear was, lest he should wake too soon.</p>
          <p>“ But while she hung over him bewildered with delight <lb/>
            so extreme at heart, the lamp, whether from treachery or <lb/>
            baneful envy, or because it longed to touch, and to kiss, as <lb/>
            it were, such a beautiful object, spirted a drop of scalding <lb/>
            ,oil from the summit of its flame upon the right shoulder <lb/>
            of the god. 0 rash, audacious lamp! vile minister to love! <lb/>
            thus to ,burn the god of all fire; you whom some lover, <lb/>
            doubtless, first invented, that he might prolong even through <lb/>
            the night the bliss of beholding the object of his. desire! <lb/>
            The God, thus scorched, sprang from the bed, and seeing <lb/>
            the disgraceful tokens of forfeited fidelity, without a word, <lb/>
            was flying away from the eyes and arms of his most unhappy <lb/>
            wife. But Psyche, the instant he arose, seized hold of his <pb n="105"/>
            <note type="margin"> BOOK V. </note> <lb/>
            right leg with both hands, and hung on to him, a wretched <lb/>
            appendage to his flight through the regions of the air, till at <lb/>
            last her strength failed her, and she fell to the earth.</p>
          <p>" Her divine lover, however, not deserting her as she lay on <lb/>
            the ground, alighted upon a neighbouring cypress tree, and <lb/>
            thus angrily addressed her from its lofty top:—‘ 0 simple, <lb/>
            simple Psyche, for you I have been unmindful of the commands <lb/>
            of my mother Venus; for when she bade me cause you to be <lb/>
            infatuated with passion for some base and abject man, I <lb/>
            chose rather to fly to you myself as a lover. That in this I <lb/>
            acted inconsiderately, I know but too well. I, that redoubtable <lb/>
            archer, have wounded myself with my own arrow, and have <lb/>
            made you my wife, that I, forsooth, might be thought by you <lb/>
            to be a serpent, and that you might cut off my head, which <lb/>
            bears those very eyes which have so doated upon you. This <lb/>
            was the danger that I told you again and again to be on your <lb/>
            guard against, this was what I so benevolently forewarned you <lb/>
            of. But as for those choice counsellors of yours, they shall <lb/>
            speedily feel my vengeance for giving you such pernicious ad. <lb/>
            vice ; but you I will punish only by my flight.' And so say­ <lb/>
            ing, he soared aloft, and flew away.</p>
          <p>“ Meanwhile Psyche lay prostrate on the ground, gazing on <lb/>
            the flight of her husband as long as ever he remained in sight, <lb/>
            and afflicting her mind with the most bitter lamentations. <lb/>
            But when the reiterated movement* of his wings had borne <lb/>
            her husband through the immensity of space till she saw him <lb/>
            no more, she threw herself headlong from the bank of the <lb/>
            adjacent river into its stream. But the gentle river, honouring <lb/>
            the God, who is in the habit of imparting his warmth to the <lb/>
            waters t themselves, and fearing his power, bore her on the <lb/>
            surface of a harmless wave to the bank, and laid her safe on <lb/>
            its flowery turf.</p>
          <p>" It chanced that just then the rural god Pan was seated <lb/>
            on the margin of the river, embracing the goddess Canna,J and <lb/>
            teaching her to sing all kinds of pleasant ditties. Close by, <note type="footnote"> * Reiterated movement.]—In the original, ‘remigio.' ‘Remigium ala. <lb/>

             <pb n="106"/>
            some she-goats gambolled as they browsed along the grassy <lb/>
            bank. The goat-legged god, aware of Pysche's misfortune, <lb/>
            kindly called the fainting, heart-stricken girl to him, and thus <lb/>
            comforted her in soothing language:—‘ Pretty damsel, though <lb/>
            I am a countryman and a shepherd, still, through the benefit <lb/>
            of a prolonged old age, I have acquired considerable experience; <lb/>
            wherefore, if I rightly conjecture-a thing that wise men no <lb/>
            doubt consider as good as the power of divination-if I rightly <lb/>
            conjecture, from those tottering and repeatedly faltering steps, <lb/>
            from the excessive paleness of your countenance, from your <lb/>
            frequent sighs, and from the sad expression of your eyes, you <lb/>
            are desperately in love. Listen, then, to me; attempt no more <lb/>
            to put an end to yourself by leaping from a precipice, or by <lb/>
            any kind of self-inflicted death; cease to grieve, lay aside your <lb/>
            sorrow, and rather in your prayers worship Cupid, the greatest <lb/>
            of the Gods, and as he is a delicate and spoilt stripling, use your <lb/>
            best endeavours to please him by soothing attentions.'</p>
          <p>" The shepherd God having thus said, Psyche made him no <lb/>
            reply, but simply paying her homage to the propitious divinity, <lb/>
            departed from the spot. After she had toiled some little way <lb/>
            along the road, she came at last to an unknown byepath, <lb/>
            and following it, she arrived at a certain city, of which the <lb/>
            husband of one of her sisters was king. On learning this cir­ <lb/>
            cumstance, Psyche requested that her arrival might be an­ <lb/>
            nounced to her sister. Being immediately conducted to her, <lb/>
            when they had mutually embraced, and the forms of salutation <lb/>
            were over, on her sister inquiring the cause of her visit, she <lb/>
            replied:</p>
          <p>" ' Of course you remember the advice you gave me, when <lb/>
            you persuaded me to destroy with a sharp razor the beast that <lb/>
            lay with me under the assumed name of a husband, before he <lb/>
            should swallow me, poor creature, in his voracious maw. I <lb/>
            proceeded to do as we had arranged; but as soon as ever I dis­ <lb/>
            cerned his features by the light of the lamp, I beheld a sight <lb/>
            truly wonderful and divine, the very son himself of the goddess <lb/>
            Venus, Cupid I say, sunk in tranquil repose. Just, however, <lb/>
            as, struck with astonishment at the sight of such a boundless <lb/>
            blessing, and in utter ecstasy through an over-abundance of <lb/>
            pleasure, I was at a loss how sufficiently to enjoy my fortune, <lb/>
            by a most shocking accident, the lamp spirted out some scald­ <lb/>
            ing oil upon his right shoulder. Instantly awakened by the <pb n="107"/>
            <note type="margin"> BOOK V. </note> <lb/>
            pain, and seeing me armed with the weapon and the light, <lb/>
            , For this shameful conduct,' said he, 'quit my bed this instant, <lb/>
            I divorce you for ever.* I will at once marry your sister,’— <lb/>
            mentioning you expressly by name,- and then he ordered <lb/>
            Zephyr to waft me beyond the precincts of the palace.'</p>
          <p>“ Scarcely had Psyche ended her narrative, when the other, <lb/>
            goaded by maddening lust and baneful envy, deceived her hus­ <lb/>
            band by a story which she had ready invented, as though she <lb/>
            had heard something about the death of her parents, and im­ <lb/>
            mediately embarking, proceeded to the same rock. When she <lb/>
            arrived there, though another wind was blowing, yet, elated <lb/>
            with blind hope, she exclaimed, ‘ Receive me, Cupid, a wife <lb/>
            worthy of thee, and thou, Zephyr, acknowledge thy mis­ <lb/>
            tress.' Then with a great bound, she threw herself headlong <lb/>
            from the mountain; but neither alive nor dead was she <lb/>
            able to reach the spot she sought. For her limbs were <lb/>
            torn in pieces by the crags, and scattered here and there as she <lb/>
            fell, her entrails were rent asunder, just as she deserved; and <lb/>
            so, furnishing a banquet for birds and beasts of prey, she <lb/>
            perished.</p>
          <p>" Nor was the other sister's punishment long delayed; for <lb/>
            Psyche's wandering steps led her to another city, in which <lb/>
            that sister dwelt; and she also, deceived by the same tale, and <lb/>
            impiously desirous of supplanting Pysche as a wife, hastened <lb/>
            to the rock, and there met with her death in a similar manner.</p>
          <p>" In the meantime, while Psyche wandered through various <lb/>
            nations, anxiously searching for Cupid, he himself, with the <lb/>
            wound from the lamp, lay in his mother's chamber groaning. <lb/>
            A snow-white sea-gull, the bird which skims along the waves <lb/>
            of the sea, flapping them with its wings, dived down into the <lb/>
            bosom of the ocean. There, approaching Venus, as she bathed <lb/>
            and swam, he informed her that her son was confined to his <lb/>
            bed by a severe burn, was in great pain, and his cure was <lb/>
            doubtful: that all sorts of scandalous reports were flying about <lb/>
            concerning the whole family of Venus ; and it was in every­ <lb/>
            body's mouth that mother and son had gone off, the one to a <lb/>
            mountain, to carry on an intrigue with a girl; the other to <note type="footnote"> * I divorce youfor ever.]—‘ Tibi tuas res habeto.' Literally,‘ take your <lb/>

            Romans in cases of divorce, when the husband returned to the wife her <lb/>
            separate property. </note> <lb/>

            amuse herself with swimming in the sea. In consequence <lb/>
            of all this, Pleasure, Grace, and Elegance are no longer to be <lb/>
            found, but everything is rude, rustic, and slovenly; nuptial <lb/>
            ties, social friendships, and love of children, exist no more; but <lb/>
            unbounded disorder, and a bitter loathing of sordid alliances. <lb/>
            Thus did this talkative and very meddling bird chatter in the <lb/>
            ear of Venus, to lower her son in her estimation.</p>
          <p>“ Venus, exceedingly enraged, instantly exclaimed, ‘ So then <lb/>
            this hopeful son of mine has already got some mistress or <lb/>
            other. Come, now, you who are the only one to serve me <lb/>
            with true affection, what is the name of her who has thus de­ <lb/>
            coyed the ingenuous and beardless boy? is she one of the tribe <lb/>
            of Nymphs, or of the number of the Hours, or of the choir of <lb/>
            the Muses, or belonging to my own train of Graces ?'</p>
          <p>" The talkative bird was only too ready to reply, ' I am not <lb/>
            quite sure, mistress. I think, though, if I remember right, he <lb/>
            is said to have fallen desperately in love with a girl, whose <lb/>
            name is Psyche.'</p>
          <p>" ' What!' exclaimed Venus, in a burst of indignation, ‘of <lb/>
            all wenches in the world, is he in love with Psyche, the <lb/>
            usurper of my beauty, and the rival of my fame ? And by <lb/>
            way of additional insult, he takes me for a go-between, through <lb/>
            whose instrumentality he made acquaintance with the girl.'</p>
          <p>" Thus exclaiming, she forthwith emerged from the sea, and <lb/>
            hastened to her golden chamber, where finding her son lying <lb/>
            ill, as she had been informed, she bawled out* as loud as ever <lb/>
            she could before she entered the door-‘This is pretty conduct, <lb/>
            indeed! and very becoming our dignified birth, and your so­ <lb/>
            briety of character. In the first place, to trample under foot <lb/>
            the commands of your mother, your sovereign mistress, and <lb/>
            refrain from tormenting my enemy with an ignoble love, and <lb/>
            then at your age, a mere boy, to take her to your profligate and <lb/>

            But doubtless you suppose, you scamp, you seducer, you unlove- <lb/>
            able boy, that you are my only high-born son, and that I am <lb/>

            will have another son, a much better one than you; nay, what'a <lb/>
            more, that you may be fully sensible of the disgrace, I will <lb/>
            adopt one of the sons of my slaves, and to him will I give <lb/>
            those wings and that torch, that bow and those arrows, and all <lb/>
            that equipment which I bestowed on you, for purposes very <lb/>
            different from these; for no part whatever of this apparatus <lb/>
            was supplied at your father's expense. But from your very <lb/>
            childhood, you have been badly inclined, and have always had <lb/>
            pugnacious hands. Many a time, too, have you most dis­ <lb/>
            respectfully struck your elders : and even myself, your mother, <lb/>
            myself, I say, you parricide, you are everyday exposing before <lb/>
            the world. Many a time you have struck me, and you pay <lb/>
            no more attention to me than if I were a widow; you do not <lb/>
            even fear your step-father, that most brave and mighty warrior; <lb/>
            quite the contrary, indeed, for you are evermore setting him <lb/>
            after wenches, to my torment. But I will make you repent of <lb/>
            these tricks of yours, and that you shall find this match a <lb/>
            sour and bitter one.'</p>
          <p>" 'But now, made a laughing-stock of, what shall I do ? <lb/>
            Whither betake myself ? How shall I coerce this slippery little <lb/>
            lizard? Shall I solicit the assistance of my old foe Sobriety, <lb/>
            whom I have so often affronted for sake of this spoiled boy ? <lb/>
            Must I have intercourse with that coarse, vulgar being ? I <lb/>
            shudder at the thought; and yet the comfort of revenge is not <lb/>
            to be despised, come whence it may. I must have recourse <lb/>
            then to her, and to her alone; that she may most soundly chas­ <lb/>
            tise this scamp. She shall rifle his quiver, blunt his arrows, <lb/>
            unstring his bow, extinguish his torch, aye, and keep his body <lb/>
            in order by the sharpest remedies. When I shall have shorn <lb/>
            off those golden locks, which these hands have so often sorted, <lb/>
            and have clipped off those pinions, which I have dyed in my <lb/>
            bosom's nectareous fountain, then, and not till then, I shall <lb/>
            believe that atonement has been made for the injury I have <lb/>
            received.</p>
          <p>"Having thus vented her wrath, she rushed impetuously <lb/>
            out of doors, and was immediately accosted by Ceres and <lb/>
            Juno, who, observing her angry countenance, asked her why <lb/>
            she marred the beauty of her sparkling eyes by such a sullen <lb/>
            frown. ' Most opportunely are you come,' she replied, ' to <lb/>
            appease* that violence which has taken possession of my <note type="footnote"> * To appease.]—' Perplacatura' seems to be a preferable reading here <lb/>

            who does not deserve to be named, cannot be unknown to you.'</p>
          <p>" The two Goddesses, knowing what had happened, thus <lb/>
            endeavoured to mitigate the rage of Venus. ' What mighty <lb/>
            offence, good mistress, has your son committed, that you should <lb/>
            thwart his pleasures with such stubborn resolution, and be <lb/>
            impatient to destroy her with whom he is in love ? Is it a <lb/>
            crime, if he has freely indulged his liking for a pretty girl ? <lb/>
            Are you ignorant of his sex, and his youth ? Surely, you have <lb/>
            forgotten how many years old he is, or is it because he carries <lb/>
            his years so prettily, that you would for ever fancy him a boy? <lb/>
            Is it possible, that you, who are his mother, and a woman of <lb/>
            understanding, can persist in prying inquisitively into the <lb/>
            gaieties of your handsome son, finding fault with his indis­ <lb/>
            cretions, taking him to task for his amours, and reproving in <lb/>
            him your own arts and voluptuous suggestions? But what <lb/>
            God or what man will bear with you, when you are everywhere <lb/>
            scattering amorous desires among people, and at the same time <lb/>
            would restrain the gallantries of your own house, and shut up <lb/>
            the universal magazine of female frailties?'</p>
          <p>" Thus did they, through fear of his darts, flatter, and gra­ <lb/>
            ciously defend Cupid in his absence. But Venus, indignant <lb/>
            that her injuries were thus treated with ridicule, turned her <lb/>
            back upon them, and with hasty steps again betook herself to <lb/>
            the ocean."</p>

          <p>it IN the meantime Psyche wandered about, day and night, <lb/>
            restlessly seeking her husband, and the more anxious to find <pb n="111"/>
            <note type="margin"> BOOK YI. </note> <lb/>
            him, because, though she had incurred his anger, she hoped to <lb/>
            appease him, if not by the tender endearments of a wife, at <lb/>
            least by entreaties as humble as a slave could urge. Perceiving <lb/>
            a temple on the summit of a lofty mountain, ' How can I tell,' <lb/>
            said she, ' but yonder may be the residence of my lord ?' and <lb/>
            immediately she hastened thither, while, wayworn and ex­ <lb/>
            hausted as she was, hope and affection quickened her steps, <lb/>
            and gave her vigour to climb the highest ridges of the moun­ <lb/>
            tain, and enter the temple. There she saw blades of wheat, <lb/>
            some in sheaves, some twisted into chaplets, and ears of barley <lb/>
            also. There were scythes likewise, and all the implements of <lb/>
            harvest, but all lying scattered about in confusion, just as such <lb/>
            things are usually thrown down, in the heat of summer, from <lb/>
            the careless hands of the reapers.</p>
          <p>" Psyche began carefully to sort all these things, and arrange <lb/>
            them properly in their several places, deeming it her duty not <lb/>
            to fail in respect for the temples and ceremonies of any deity, <lb/>
            but to implore the benevolent sympathy of all the Gods. <lb/>
            Bounteous Ceres found her thus diligently employed in her <lb/>
            temple, and cried to her, from a distance: ' Ah, poor unfor­ <lb/>
            tunate Psyche! Venus, full of rage, is eagerly tracking your <lb/>
            footsteps, craving to inflict upon you the deadly penalties, <lb/>
            and the whole force of her divine vengeance. And can you <lb/>
            then busy yourself with my concerns, and think of anything <lb/>
            else but your own safety ?'</p>
          <p>" Psyche, prostrating herself before the goddess, moistening <lb/>
            her feet with abundant tears, and sweeping the ground with <lb/>
            her locks, besought her protection with manifold prayers. ' I <lb/>
            implore thee,' said she, ' by thy fruit-bearing right hand, by <lb/>
            the joyful ceremonies of harvest, by the mysterious rites of thy <lb/>

            bodily powers, weakened by long-continued labour, be renewed <lb/>

          <p>"' I am touched by your tears and entreaties,' Ceres re­ <lb/>
            plied, ' and fain would render you assistance; but I cannot <lb/>

          <p>"Psyche, thus repulsed, contrary to her expectations, an I <lb/>
            afflicted with twofold grief, retraced the way she came, and <lb/>
            presently espied in a gloomy grove of the valley below the <lb/>
            mountain, a temple of exquisite structure. Unwilling to omit <lb/>
            any chance of better fortune, though ever so remote, but re­ <lb/>
            solving rather to implore the protection of the god, whoever <lb/>
            he might be, she approached the sacred doors. There she be­ <lb/>
            held splendid offerings, and garments embroidered with golden <lb/>
            letters, fastened to the branches of trees and to the door-posts <lb/>
            of the temple; upon which was recorded the name of the god­ <lb/>
            dess to whom they had been dedicated, and also the particulars <lb/>
            of the favour received.</p>
          <p>" Then Psyche fell upon her knees, and with her hands <lb/>
            embracing the yet warm artar, having first wiped away her <lb/>
            tears, she thus offered up a prayer: 1 0 sister and consort of <lb/>
            mighty Jove! whether thou dost inhabit the ancient temples <lb/>
            of Samos,* which glories in thy birth, thy complaining infancy, <lb/>

          <p>"While Psyche thus prayed, Juno appeared before her, in <lb/>
            all the august majesty of her divinity, and said, 'How readily <lb/>
            would I lend an ear to your entreaties; but propriety will not <lb/>

            being no longer able to make search for her volatile husband, <lb/>
            Psyche gave up all hopes of safety, and thus communed with <lb/>
            herself. 'What other relief for my sorrows can now be looked <lb/>
            for or procured, since even goddesses cannot, though willing, <lb/>
            afford me any assistance ? In what direction shall I once more <lb/>
            bend my wandering steps, entangled, as I am, in snares so <lb/>
            inextricable ? Concealed in what habitations, in what dark­ <lb/>
            ness even, can I escape the ever-vigilant eyes of the mighty <lb/>
            Venus ? Assume, then, a masculine courage, my soul, boldly <lb/>
            renounce vain hopes, voluntarily surrender yourself into the <lb/>
            hands of your mistress, and try, though late, to soften her rage <lb/>
            by submissive behaviour. Besides, who knows whether you <lb/>
            may not perhaps find in his mother's house him whom you <lb/>
            have been so long seeking in vain! Thus prepared for this <lb/>
            doubtful experiment of duty, or rather for certain destruction, <lb/>
            she considered with herself how she was to preface her en­ <lb/>
            treaties.</p>
          <p>" Venus, meanwhile, declining to employ earthly means in <lb/>
            pursuing her inquiries after Psyche, returned to heaven. She <lb/>
            ordered the chariot to be got ready, which Vulcan had con­ <lb/>

            celebration of her marriage. The nuptial gift was of burnished <lb/>

            with joyous flutterings, and bending their painted necks to <lb/>
            the jewelled yoke, flew forward with the chariot that contained <lb/>
            the goddess. Around it wantoned chattering sparrows, and <lb/>
            other birds of sweet note, which announced the approach of <lb/>
            Venus in melodious strains.</p>
          <p>"And now the clouds dispersed, heaven unfolded itself be­ <lb/>
            fore its daughter, and the lofty æther received the goddess <lb/>
            with joy; nor did the tuneful retinue of Venus dread the <lb/>
            attack of eagles, or rapacious hawks. She went straightway <lb/>
            to the royal citadel of Jove, and with a haughty air demanded, <lb/>
            as especially necessary, the services of the crier god ; nor did <lb/>
            the azure brow of Jupiter refuse its assent. Exulting Venus, <lb/>
            accompanied by Mercury, immediately descended from heaven, <lb/>
            and thus anxiously addressed him: ' My Arcadian brother, you <lb/>
            well know that your sister, Venus, never did anything without <lb/>
            the presence of Mercury, nor are you ignorant how long I <lb/>
            have been unable to find my absconded female slave. Nothing <lb/>
            remains, therefore, to be done, but for you to proclaim her in <lb/>
            public, and announce a reward to him who shall find her. <lb/>
            Take care, therefore, that my commands are speedily executed, <lb/>
            and clearly describe the marks by which she may be recog­ <lb/>
            nized; that no one may excuse himself on the plea of ignorance, <lb/>
            if he incurs the crime of unlawfully concealing her.'</p>
          <p>" So saying, she gave him a little book, in which were <lb/>
            written Psyche's name, and sundry particulars. This done, she <lb/>
            immediately returned home. Nor did Mercury neglect her <lb/>
            commands; for going about among all nations, he thus per­ <lb/>
            formed his duties as crier : ' If any one can seize in her flight, <lb/>
            and bring back, a fugitive daughter of a king, a handmaid of <lb/>
            Venus, and by name Psyche, or discover where she has con­ <lb/>
            cealed herself, let such person repair to Mercury, the crier, <lb/>

            back of the temple of Venus Murtia, or guardian of the myrtle, which <lb/>
            was built on Mount Aventine, at Rome. In the first idyl of Moschus, <lb/>
            Venus thus proclaims the reward for her fugitive child ; <lb/>
            ' On him who the haunts of my Cupid can show, <lb/>
            A kiss of the tenderest stamp I'll bestow; <lb/>
            But he who can bring me the wanderer here, <lb/>
            Shall have something more rapturous, something more dear.' <lb/>
            This ' something more' is the quicquid post oscula duke of Secundus </note> <pb n="115"/>
            <note type="margin"> BOOK VI. </note> <lb/>
            ward, for the discovery, seven sweet kisses from Venus herself, <lb/>
            and one exquisitely delicious touch of her charming tongue.'</p>
          <p>"Mercury having thus made proclamation, the desire of ob­ <lb/>
            taining such a reward excited the emulous endeavours of all <lb/>
            mankind, and this circumstance it was that quite put an end <lb/>
            to all Psyche's hesitation. She was already near her mistress's <lb/>
            gates, when she was met by one of the retinue of Venus, whose <lb/>
            name was HABIT, and who immediately cried out, as loud as <lb/>
            she could bawl, ' So, you most good-for-nothing wench, have <lb/>
            you at last begun to discover that you have a mistress? And <lb/>
            do you pretend, too, in your abundant assurance, that you don't <lb/>
            know what immense trouble we have had in endeavouring to <lb/>
            find you out ? But it is well that you have fallen into my <lb/>
            hands, of all others, and have got within the very jaws of <lb/>
            Orcus, to receive, without delay, the penalty of such obstinate <lb/>
            contumacy!</p>
          <p>" So saying, she instantly twisted her hands in Psyche's hair, <lb/>
            and dragged the unresisting captive along. But Venus, the <lb/>
            moment she was dragged into her presence, burst into a loud <lb/>
            laugh, such as people laugh who are furiously angry; and <lb/>
            shaking her head and scratching her right ear.* 'At length,' <lb/>
            said she, 'have you deigned to pay your respects to your <lb/>
            mother-in-law? Or rather, are you come to see your sick <lb/>
            husband, who is yet dangerously ill from the wound you gave <lb/>
            him ? But make yourself easy; for I shall at once give you <lb/>
            a reception such as a good mother-in-law ought to give. <lb/>
            "Where,' she cried, ' are those servants of mine, ANXIETY and <lb/>
            SORROW ?' These attending, at her call, she delivered her to <lb/>
            them to be tormented! Thereupon, in obedience to the com­ <lb/>
            mands of their mistress, they scourged and inflicted other tor­ <lb/>
            ments on the wretched Psyche, and after they had tortured <lb/>
            her, brought her back again into the presence of Venus.</p>
          <p>" ' Just look at her,' said Venus, again setting up a laugh ; <lb/>
            ' her interesting state quite moves my compassion, since it is <lb/>
            through that, forsooth, that she is to make me a happy grand­ <lb/>
            mother. Fortunate, indeed, am I, who, in the very flower of <lb/>
            my age, am to be called a grandmother! And the son of a <lb/>
            vile handmaid is to hear himself called the grandson of Venus! <lb/>
            And yet I talk nonsense in calling him my grandson; for ill- <lb/>
            assorted marriages, contracted, too, in a country place, without <note type="footnote"> * Scratching her right car.]—According to Pliny, the throne of Nemesis, <lb/>
            the goddess of revenge, is behind the right ear. </note> <lb/>

            any witnesses, and without the father's consent, cannot pos­ <lb/>
            sibly be deemed legitimate; consequently this child will be a <lb/>
            bastard, even if I do suffer you to bring it into the light at all.'</p>
          <p>" Having thus said, she flew upon her, tore her clothes in a <lb/>
            great many places, pulled out her hair, shook her by the head, <lb/>
            and grievously maltreated her. Then, taking wheat, barley, <lb/>
            millet, poppy, vetches, lentils, and beans, and, mixing them all <lb/>
            together in one heap, she said to her: ' You seem to me, such <lb/>
            an ugly slave as you now are, to be likely to gain lovers in <lb/>
            no other way than by diligent drudgery. I will, therefore, <lb/>
            myself, for once, make trial of your industrious habits. Take <lb/>
            and separate this promiscuous mass of seeds, and having pro­ <lb/>
            perly placed each grain in its place, and so sorted the whole, <lb/>
            give me a proof of your expedition, by finishing the task before <lb/>
            evening.' Then having delivered over to her the vast heap of <lb/>
            seeds, she at once took her departure for a nuptial banquet.</p>
          <p>" But Psyche astounded at the stupendous task, sat silent and <lb/>
            stupified, and did not move a hand to the confused and inex­ <lb/>
            tricable mass. Just then, a tiny little ant, one of the inhabi­ <lb/>
            tants of the fields, became aware of this prodigious difficulty; <lb/>
            and pitying the distress of the partner of the mighty god, and <lb/>
            execrating the mother-in-law's cruelty, it ran busily about, <lb/>
            and summoned together the whole tribe of ants in the neigh­ <lb/>
            bourhood, crying to them, 'Take pity on her, ye active children <lb/>
            of the all-producing earth ! Take pity, and make haste to help <lb/>
            the wife of Love, a pretty damsel, who is now in a perilous <lb/>
            situation.'</p>
          <p>" Immediately the six-footed people came rushing in whole <lb/>
            waves one upon another, and with the greatest diligence sepa­ <lb/>
            rated the whole heap, grain by grain ; then, having assorted <lb/>
            the various kinds into different heaps, they vanished forthwith.</p>
          <p>" At nightfall, Venus returned home from the nuptial ban­ <lb/>
            quet, exhilarated with wine, fragrant with balsams, and having <lb/>
            her waist encircled with blooming roses. As soon as she saw <lb/>
            with what marvellous expedition the task had been executed, <lb/>
            ' This is no work of your hands, wicked creature,' she said, <lb/>
            ' but his whom you have charmed, to your own sorrow and <lb/>
            his;' and throwing her a piece of coarse bread, she went to bed.</p>
          <p>" Meanwhile, Cupid was closely confined in his chamber, <lb/>
            partly that he might not inflame his wound by froward indul­ <lb/>
            gence, and partly lest he should associate with his beloved. <lb/>
            The lovers, thus separated from each other under one roof, <pb n="117"/>
            <note type="margin"> BOOK VI. </note> <lb/>
            passed a miserable night. But as soon as Aurora had ushered <lb/>
            in the morning, Venus called Psyche, and thus addressed her: <lb/>
            ' Do you see yonder grove, stretching along the margin of a <lb/>
            river, whose deep eddies receive the waters of a neighbouring <lb/>
            fountain? There shining sheep of a golden colour wander <lb/>
            about, feeding without a shepherd. I desire that you bring <lb/>
            me immediately a flock of that precious wool, get it how you <lb/>
            may.'</p>
          <p>" Psyche willingly set out, not with any intention of exe­ <lb/>
            cuting this command, but to procure rest from her misfortunes, <lb/>
            by hurling herself headlong from the rock into the river. But <lb/>
            when she came to the brink, a green reed, the nurse of sweet <lb/>
            music,* divinely inspired by a gentle breath of air, thus pro­ <lb/>
            phetically murmured : ' Psyche ! exercised in mighty sorrows, <lb/>
            neither pollute my sacred waters by your most miserable death, <lb/>
            nor venture yet to approach the formidable sheep on the oppo­ <lb/>
            site bank. While heated by the burning radiance of the sun, <lb/>
            they are transported with savage rage, and are the destruction <lb/>
            of mortals, either by their sharp horns, their stony foreheads, <lb/>
            or their venomous bites. Therefore until the sun has declined <lb/>
            from the meridian, and the serene spirit of the flood has <lb/>
            lulled the animals to rest, you may hide yourself under yonder <lb/>
            lofty plane tree, which drinks of the same river with myself; <lb/>
            and as soon as the sheep have mitigated their fury, if you shake <lb/>
            the branches of the neighbouring grove, you will find the woolly <lb/>
            gold every where sticking to them.' Thus the artless and <lb/>
            humane reed taught the wretched Psyche how to accomplish <lb/>
            this dangerous enterprise with safety.</p>
          <p>" Psyche, therefore, observing all the directions, found her <lb/>
            obedience was not in vain, but returned to Venus with her <lb/>
            I bosom fullt of the delicate golden fleece. Yet she was not able <lb/>
            to win the approbation of her mistress by this her second peri­ <lb/>
            lous labour. But Venus, smiling bitterly with knitted brows, <lb/>
            thus addressed her: 1 I do not fail to perceive another's hand <lb/>
            in the performance of this task also; but I will now try whe­ <lb/>
            ther you are endowed with a courageous mind and singular <lb/>
            prudence. Do you see the summit of yonder lofty mountain ? <lb/>
            From that peak fall the dusky waters of a black fountain, which. <note type="footnote"> * Nurse of sweet music.]—So called because the pipe of Pan was <lb/>
            formed of reeds joined together. </note><note type="footnote"> t Her bosom full.]—The ancients used the part of the robe that <lb/>
            covered the bosom. as a pocket. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="118"/>
            after being confined in the neighbouring valley, irrigate the <lb/>
            Stygian marshes, and supply the hoarse streams of Cocytus ? <lb/>
            Bring me immediately in this little urn, ice-cold water drawn <lb/>
            from the very midst of the lofty fountain.' Thus speaking, <lb/>
            she gave her a vessel of polished crystal, and at the same time <lb/>
            threatened her more severely than before.</p>
          <p>" But Psyche started off with the utmost celerity to reach <lb/>
            the very summit of the mountain, presuming that there, at <lb/>
            least, she would find the period of her most miserable life. <lb/>
            However, when she arrived at its confines, she saw the <lb/>
            deadly difficulty of the stupendous undertaking. For a rock, <lb/>
            enormously lofty, and inaccessibly rugged, vomits from its <lb/>
            middle the horrid waters of the fountain, which, immediately <lb/>
            falling headlong, are carried unseen through a deep, narrow, <lb/>
            and covered channel into the neighbouring valley. On the <lb/>
            right and left hand they creep through hollow rocks, over <lb/>
            which fierce dragons stretch out their long necks, and keep a <lb/>
            perpetual watch with unwinking vigilance. And the vocal <lb/>
            waters exclaim ever and anon as they roll along, ' Begone; <lb/>
            what are you about ? Mind what you do; take care; By, <lb/>
            you will perish.'</p>
          <p>" Psyche, therefore, petrified through the impossibility of <lb/>
            accomplishing the task, though she was present in body was <lb/>
            absent in mind, and being perfectly overwhelmed by the in­ <lb/>
            extricable danger, was even deprived of the benefit of tears, <lb/>
            the last solace of the wretched. But the sorrow of the inno­ <lb/>
            cent soul is not concealed from the penetrating eyes of Provi­ <lb/>
            dence. The rapacious eagle, Jove's royal bird, on a sudden <lb/>
            flew to her with expanded wings, remembering his ancient <lb/>
            obligations to Cupid, who enabled him to carry the Phrygian <lb/>
            cup-bearer up to Jove; therefore, in gratitude to the young <lb/>
            god, the eagle deserted the lofty paths of Jupiter, and bringing <lb/>
            seasonable assistance to Cupid's wife in her distress, ho thus <lb/>
            addressed her: ' Can you, simple as you are, and inexperienced <lb/>
            in attempts of this kind, ever hope to steal one drop of this <lb/>
            most holy and no less terrible fountain ? Have you not heard, <lb/>
            at least, that these Stygian waters are formidable even to <lb/>
            Jupiter himself, and that as you swear by the divinity of the <lb/>
            gods, so they are accustomed to swear by the majesty of Styx ? <lb/>
            But give me that little urn.' Snatching it in haste, he sailed <lb/>
            away on his strong wings, steering his course to the right and <lb/>
            to the left, between the rows of raging teeth, and the three- <pb n="119"/>
            <note type="margin"> BOOK VI. </note> <lb/>
            forked vibrating tongues of the dragons until he reached and <lb/>
            drew the reluctant waters, which warned him to begone while he <lb/>
            might in safety. But he pretended that Venus herself wanted <lb/>
            some of the water, and had ordered him to procure it; and on <lb/>
            this account his access to the fountain was somewhat facilitated.</p>
          <p>" Psyche, therefore, joyfully receiving the full um, returned <lb/>
            with all speed to Venus. Yet not even by the accomplishment of <lb/>
            this dangerous enterprise, could she appease the anger of the <lb/>
            raging goddess. For designing to expose her to still more outra­ <lb/>
            geous trials, Venus thus addressed her, a smile, the harbinger of <lb/>
            ruin, accompanying her words: 'You appear to me to be a pro­ <lb/>
            found and malevolent sorceress, or you never could with so <lb/>
            much dexterity have performed my commands : but there is <lb/>
            one task more, my dear, which you must perform. Take this <lb/>
            box,' she said, delivering it to her, ' and direct your course to <lb/>
            the infernal regions and the deadly palace of Pluto. Then pre­ <lb/>
            senting the box to Proserpine, say, Venus requests you to send <lb/>
            her a small portion of your beauty, at least as much as may be <lb/>
            sufficient for one short day; for she has consumed all the <lb/>
            beauty she possessed, through the attention which she pays to <lb/>
            her sick son. But return with the utmost expedition ; for I <lb/>
            must adorn myself with this beauty of Proserpine, before I go <lb/>
            . to the theatre of the gods.'</p>
          <p>" Psyche was now truly sensible that she was arrived at the <lb/>
            extremity of her evil fortune; and clearly perceived that she <lb/>
            was openly and undisguisedly impelled to immediate destruc­ <lb/>
            tion, since she was forced to direct her steps to Tartarus and <lb/>
            the shades below. Without any further delay, therefore, she <lb/>
            proceeded towards a lofty tower, that she might thence hurl <lb/>
            herself headlong; for she considered that she should thus <lb/>
            descend by a straight and easy road to the infernal regions. <lb/>
            But she was no sooner arrived there, than the tower suddenly <lb/>
            addressed her in the following words:</p>
          <p>" ' Why, 0 miserable creature, dost thou seek to destroy thy­ <lb/>
            self by falling headlong hence ? And why dost thou" rashly <lb/>
            sink under this thy last danger and endurance ? For as soon <lb/>
            as thy breath shall thus be separated from thy body, thou wilt <lb/>
            indeed descend to profound Tartarus, but canst not by any <lb/>
            means return thence. Listen, therefore, to me. Lacedæmon, <lb/>
            a noble city of Achaia, is not far from hence. Near this city, <lb/>
            concealed in devious places, is Tenarus, which you must seek; <lb/>
            for there you will find a cavity, which is Pluto's breathing <lb/>
             <pb n="120"/>
            hole, and an untraversed road presents itself to the view through <lb/>
            the yawning gap. As soon as you have passed the threshold <lb/>
            of this cavity, you will proceed in a direct path to the palace <lb/>
            of Pluto. You ought not, however, to pass through those <lb/>
            shades with empty hands, but should take a sop of barley <lb/>
            bread, soaked in hydromel, in each hand, and in your mouth <lb/>
            two pieces of money. And when you have accomplished <lb/>
            a good part of your deadly journey, you will meet a lame <lb/>
            ass laden with wood, with a driver as lame as himself, who <lb/>
            will ask you to reach him certain cords to fasten the bur­ <lb/>
            den which has fallen from the ass: but be careful that you <lb/>
            pass by him in silence. Then, without any delay, proceed till <lb/>
            you arrive at the dead river, where Charon, immediately de­ <lb/>
            manding his fee, ferries the passengers over in his patched <lb/>
            boat to the farthest shore.</p>
          <p>" , Avarice, it appears, lives among the dead ; nor does Charon <lb/>
            himself, nor the father Pluto, though so great a god, do any <lb/>
            thing gratuitously. The poor man dying, ought to prepare his <lb/>
            viaticum; but if he has no money at hand, will no one suffer <lb/>
            him to expire ? To this squalid old man give one of the pieces <lb/>
            of money which you carry with you; yet in such a manner, <lb/>
            that he may take it with his own hand from your mouth. <lb/>
            While you are passing over the sluggish river, a certain dead <lb/>
            old man, floating on its surface, and raising his putrid hand, <lb/>
            will entreat you to take him into the boat. Beware, however, <lb/>
            of yielding to any impulse of unlawful pity. Having passed <lb/>
            over the river, and proceeded to a little distance beyond it, <lb/>
            you will see certain old women, weaving a web, who will re­ <lb/>
            quest you to lend them a helping hand; but it is not lawful <lb/>
            for you to touch the web. For all these, and many other par- <lb/>
            ticularis, are snares prepared for you by Venus, that you may <lb/>
            drop one of the sops out of your hands. But do not suppose <lb/>
            that this would be a trifling loss ; since the want of only one <lb/>
            of these sops, would prevent your return to light. For a huge <lb/>
            dog, with three large, fierce, and formidable necks and heads, <lb/>
            barking with his thundering jaws, terrifies in vain the dead, <lb/>
            whom he cannot injure; and always watching before the <lb/>
            threshold and black palace of Proserpine, guards the void Plu­ <lb/>
            tonian mansion. Having appeased this do- with one of your <lb/>
            sops, you may easily pass by him, and then you will imme­ <lb/>
            diately enter the presence of Proserpine herself, who will re­ <lb/>
            ceive you in a very courteous and benignant manner, desire <pb n="121"/>
            <note type="margin"> BOOK VI. </note> <lb/>
            you to repose on a soft seat, and persuade you to partake of a <lb/>
            sumptuous banquet. But seat yourself on the ground, ask for <lb/>
            a piece of common bread, and eat it; then deliver your mes­ <lb/>
            sage, and having received what you came for, bribe the cruel <lb/>
            do- with the remaining sop. Afterwards, having given to the <lb/>
            avaricious ferryman the piece of money which you have re­ <lb/>
            served, and having passed his river, you will return by the <lb/>
            way you came to the choir of the celestial stars. But, above <lb/>
            all things, I warn you, be particularly cautious not to open or <lb/>
            look on the box which you carry, or explore that concealed <lb/>
            treasury of divine beauty.' In this manner, the propitious <lb/>
            tower delivered its prophetic admonitions.</p>
          <p>" Psyche, therefore, without delay, proceeded to Tenarus, <lb/>
            and duly taking her pieces of money and her sops, ran down <lb/>
            the infernal avenue. Here, having passed by the lame ass in <lb/>
            silence, given the ferryman his fee, neglected the entreaties of <lb/>
            the floating corpse, despised the fraudulent prayers of the <lb/>
            spinsters, and lulled the rage of the horrid do- with a sop, she <lb/>
            entered the palace of Proserpine. Nor did she accept the deli­ <lb/>
            cate seat, or delicious banquet; but humbly sat at the feet of <lb/>
            Proserpine, and contented with a piece of common bread, deli­ <lb/>
            vered her embassy from Venus. Immediately after this, she <lb/>
            received the box secretly filled and shut; and having stopped <lb/>
            the barking mouth of the dog with the remaining sop, and <lb/>
            given the ferryman the other piece of money, she returned from <lb/>
            the infernal regions much more vigorous than before.</p>
          <p>" Having again beheld and adored the fair light of day, <lb/>
            though she was in haste to finish her errand, she was seized <lb/>
            with a rash curiosity: ' Behold,' said she, ' what a foolish <lb/>
            bearer am I of divine beauty, who do not even take the least <lb/>
            portion of it, that I may by this means appear pleasing in the <lb/>
            eyes of my beautiful lover.' As she ended this soliloquy, she <lb/>
            opened the box; but it contained no beauty, nor indeed any­ <lb/>
            thing but an infernal and truly Stygian sleep, which being freed <lb/>
            from its confinement, immediately seizes her, suffuses all her <lb/>
            members with a dense cloud of somnolence, and holds her <lb/>
            prostrate on the very spot where she opened the box; so that <lb/>
            she lay motionless, and nothing else than a sleeping corpse.</p>
          <p>" But Cupid, being now recovered of his wound, and unable <lb/>
            to endure the long absence of his Psyche, glided through the <lb/>
            narrow window of the bedchamber in which he was confined. <lb/>
             <pb n="122"/>
            His wings, invigorated by repose, flew far more swiftly than <lb/>
            before; he hastened to his Psyche, and carefully brushing off <lb/>
            the cloud of sleep, and shutting it up again in its old recep­ <lb/>
            tacle, the box, he roused Psyche with an innoxious touch of <lb/>
            one of his arrows. ' Behold,' said he, ' unhappy girl, again <lb/>
            you have all but perished, a victim to curiosity. Now, how­ <lb/>
            ever, strenuously perform the task imposed upon you by my <lb/>
            mother, and I myself will take care of the rest.' Having thus <lb/>
            spoken, the lover soared aloft on his wings, and Psyche imme­ <lb/>
            diately carried the present of Proserpine to Venus.</p>
          <p>" In the meantime, Cupid, wasting away through excess of <lb/>
            love, and dreading his mother's sudden prudery, betakes him­ <lb/>
            self to his usual weapons of craft, and having with rapid wings <lb/>
            penetrated the summit of heaven, supplicates the mighty Ju­ <lb/>
            piter, and defends his cause. Then Jupiter, stroking the little <lb/>
            cheeks of Cupid, and kissing his hand, thus addressed him :— <lb/>
            ' Though you, my masterful son, never pay me that reverence <lb/>
            which has been decreed me by the synod of the Gods, but per.. <lb/>
            petually wound this breast of mine, by which the laws of the <lb/>
            elements and the revolutions of the stars are governed, and <lb/>
            frequently defile it with earthly intrigues, contrary to the laws, <lb/>
            the Julian edict,* and public discipline, injuring my reputa­ <lb/>
            tion and fame by base adulteries, and sordidly changing my <lb/>
            serene countenance into serpents, fire, wild beasts, birds, and <lb/>
            cattle; nevertheless, remembering my own moderation, and <lb/>
            that you have been nursed in these hands of mine, I will ac­ <lb/>
            complish all that you desire. At the same time you must <lb/>
            be sensible that you ought to guard against rivals, and to re­ <lb/>
            compense me for this service, by presenting me with any girl <lb/>
            of transcendent beauty that may now happen to be upon the <lb/>
            earth.'</p>
          <p>" Having thus spoken, he ordered Mercury immediately <lb/>
            to summon an assembly of all the Gods; and at the same <lb/>
            time to proclaim, that if any one of the celestials absented <lb/>
            himself, he should be fined ten thousand pieces of money. <lb/>
            The fear of such a penalty caused the celestial theatre to be <lb/>
            filled immediately; whereupon lofty Jupiter, sitting on his <lb/>
            sublime throne, thus addressed the assembly of Gods:—' Ye <lb/>
            conscript Gods, whose names are registered in the white roll of <note type="footnote"> * The Julian edict.]—Alluding to the law against adultery, instituted <lb/>
            by Augustus Cæsar. </note> <pb n="123"/>
            <note type="margin"> BOOK VI. </note> <lb/>
            the Muses, you are all well acquainted with that youth whom <lb/>
            I have reared with my own hands, and the impetuous fire of <lb/>
            whose juvenile years I deem it necessary to restrain by some <lb/>
            bridle or other. It is sufficient that he is every day defamed in <lb/>
            conversation, for the adulteries and all manner of corruption <lb/>
            of which he is the cause. Every occasion of this must be taken <lb/>
            away, and his youthful libertinism must be bound in nuptial <lb/>
            fetters. He has made choice of a girl, and deprived her of her <lb/>
            virginity. Let him, therefore, hold her, let him possess her, and <lb/>
            embracing Psyche, always enjoy the object of his love.' Then <lb/>
            turning his face to Venus, 'Nor do you, my daughter,' said <lb/>
            he, ' be sorrowful on this occasion, nor fearful that your pedi­ <lb/>
            gree and rank will be disgraced by a mortal marriage; for I <lb/>
            will now cause the nuptials not to be unequal, but legitimate, <lb/>
            and agreeable to the civil law.' Immediately after this, he <lb/>
            ordered Mercury to bring Psyche to heaven; and as soon as <lb/>
            she arrived, extending to her a cup of ambrosia, ' Take this,' <lb/>
            said he, ' Psyche, and be immortal; nor shall Cupid ever <lb/>
            depart from your embrace, but these nuptials of yours shall <lb/>
            be perpetual.'</p>
          <p>" Then, without delay, a sumptuous wedding supper was <lb/>
            served up. The husband, reclining at the upper end of the <lb/>
            table, embraced Psyche in his bosom ; in like manner, Jupiter <lb/>
            was seated with Juno, and after them, the other gods and <lb/>
            goddesses in their proper order. Then Jupiter was presented <lb/>
            with a bowl of nectar, the wine of the Gods, by the rustic <lb/>
            youth Ganymede, his cup-bearer; but Bacchus supplied the <lb/>
            rest. Vulcan dressed the supper; the Hours empurpled every­ <lb/>
            thing with roses and other fragrant flowers; the Graces <lb/>
            scattered balsam; the Muses sang melodiously; Apollo accom­ <lb/>
            panied the lyre with his voice; and beautiful Venus danced <lb/>
            with steps in unison with the delightful music. The order, <lb/>
            too, of the entertainment was, that the Muses should sing <lb/>
            the chorus, Satyrus play on the flute, and Peniscus* on the <lb/>
            pipe. Thus Psyche came lawfully into the hands of Cupid; <lb/>
            and at length, from a mature pregnancy, a daughter was born <lb/>
            to them, whom we denominate PLEASURE." †</p>
          <p>END OF THE FIFTH EPISODE. <note type="footnote"> * Peniscus.]-One of the satyrs of the wood. </note><note type="footnote"> t The following explanation of this beautiful fable is, for the most part, </note> <pb n="124"/>
            </p>
          <p>Such was the tale told to the captive damsel by that delirious <lb/>
            and tipsy old woman; but I, who stood not far from her, <note type="footnote"> extracted from the Introduction to a translation of it, formerly made by <lb/>
            me, and published in the year 1795. </note><note type="footnote"> This fable, which was designed to represent the lapse of the soul from <lb/>
            the intelligible world to the earth, was certainly not invented by Apuleius; <lb/>
            for, as it will appear in the course of this note, it is evidently alluded to by <lb/>
            Synesius, in his book on Dreams, and obscurely by Plato and Plotinus. It <lb/>
            is clear, therefore, that Plato could not derive his allusion from Apuleius; <lb/>
            and as to Plotinus and Synesius, those who are at all acquainted with the <lb/>
            writings of the Greek philosophers, well know that they never borrowed <lb/>
            from Latin authors, from a just conviction that they had the sources of <lb/>
            perfection among themselves. </note><note type="footnote"> I have said, that this fable represented the lapse of the human soul; of <lb/>
            the truth of which, the philosophical reader will be convinced by the fol­ <lb/>
            lowing observations. In the first place, the Gods, as I have elsewhere <lb/>
            shown, are super-essential natures, from their profound union with the <lb/>
            first cause, who is super-essential without any addition. But though the <lb/>
            Gods, through their summits or unities, transcend essence, yet their unities <lb/>
            are participated either by intellect alone, or by intellect and soul, or by <lb/>
            intellect, soul, and body; from which participations the various orders of <lb/>
            the Gods are deduced. When. therefore, intellect, soul, and body, are in <lb/>
            conjunction, suspended from the super-essential unity, which is the centre, <lb/>
            flower, or blossom, of a divine nature, then the God from whom they are <lb/>
            suspended is called a mundane God. In the next place, the common pa­ <lb/>
            rents of the human soul are the intellect and soul of the world : but its <lb/>
            proximate parents are the intellect and soul of the particular star about <lb/>
            which it was originally distributed, and from which it first descends. In <lb/>
            the third place, those powers of every mundane God, which are partici­ <lb/>
            pated by the body suspended from his nature, are called mundane; but <lb/>
            those who are participated by his intellect, are called super-mundane ; and <lb/>
            the soul, while subsisting in union with these super-mundane powers, is - <lb/>
            said to be in the intelligible world ; but when she wholly directs her at­ <lb/>
            tention to the mundane powers of her God, she is said to descend from <lb/>
            the intelligible world, even while subsisting in the heavens. </note><note type="footnote"> Thus much being premised, let us proceed to the explanation of the <lb/>
            fable. Psyche, then, or soul, is described as transcendently beautiful, and <lb/>
            this is indeed true of every human soul, before it profoundly merges itself <lb/>
            in the defiling folds of dark matter. In the next place, when Psyche is <lb/>
            represented as descending from the summit of a lofty mountain, into a <lb/>
            beautiful valley, this signifies the descent of the soul from the intelligible <lb/>
            world into a mundane condition of being, but yet without abandoning its <lb/>
            establishment in the heavens. Hence, the palace which Psyche beholds <lb/>
            in the valley, is, with great propriety, said to be 'a royal house, which <lb/>
            was not raised by human, but by divine hands and art.' The gems, too, <lb/>
            on which Psyche is said to have trod in every part of this palace, are <lb/>
            evidently symbolical of the stars. Of this mundane, yet celestial condi. </note> <pb n="125"/>
            <note type="margin"> BOOK VI. </note> <lb/>
            lamented, by Hercules, that I had not the means of committing <lb/>
            to writing such a beautiful fable.</p>
          <p>And now the robbers returned laden with booty, having <note type="footnote"> tion of being, the incorporeal voices which attended upon Psyche, are <lb/>
            likewise symbolical: for outward discourse is the last image of intellectual <lb/>
            energy, according to which the soul alone operates in the intelligible world. <lb/>
            As voices, therefore, they signify an establishment subordinate-to that <lb/>
            which is intelligible, but so far as denuded of body, they also signify a <lb/>
            condition of being superior to a terrene allotment. </note><note type="footnote"> Psyche, in this delightful situation, is married to an invisible being, <lb/>
            whom she alone recognises by her ears and hands. This invisible hus­ <lb/>
            band proves afterwards to be Cupid, or Love; that is to say, the soul, <lb/>
            while established in the heavens, is united to love of the purest kind, i e. <lb/>
            to intellectual love, or, in other words, is not fascinated with outward <lb/>
            form. But in this beautiful palace she is attacked by the machinations of <lb/>
            her two sisters, who endeavour to persuade her to explore the form of her <lb/>
            unknown husband. The sisters, therefore, signify those two powers of <lb/>
            the irrational part of the soul, anger and desire, the latter of which powers <lb/>
            is well defined by the Pythagoreans to be a certain tendency, impulse, and <lb/>
            appetite of the soul, in order to be filled with something, or to enjoy <lb/>
            something present, or to be disposed according to some sensitive energy ; <lb/>
            just as reason or the rational, soul is signified by Psyche. The stratagems <lb/>
            of these sisters at length take effect, and Psyche beholds and falls in love <lb/>
            with Love; that is to say, the rational part, through the incentives of <lb/>
            anger and desire, becomes enamoured of, and captivated with, outward <lb/>
            form ; in consequence of which Cupid, or intellectual love, flies away, and <lb/>
            Psyche, or the rational soul, is precipitated to earth. It is remarkable <lb/>
            that Psyche, after falling to the ground, is represented as having ' a stum­ <lb/>
            bling and often reeling gait;' for Plato, in the Phædo, says, that the soul <lb/>
            is drawn into body with a staggering motion. </note><note type="footnote"> After this, commence the wanderings of Psyche in search of Cupid, <lb/>
            or intellectual love, from whose embraces she is unhappily torn away. <lb/>
            In the course of her journey, she arrives at the temples of Ceres and <lb/>
            Juno, whose aid she suppliantly implores. Her conduct, indeed, in this <lb/>
            respect, is highly becoming. For Ceres comprehends in her essence <lb/>
            Juno, who is the fountain of souls ; and the safety of the soul arises from <lb/>
            converting herself to the divine sources of her being. </note><note type="footnote"> In the next place, Venus is represented desiring Mercury to proclaim <lb/>
            Psyche through all lands, as one of her female slaves, that had fled from <lb/>
            her service. It is likewise said that she gave him a small volume, in <lb/>
            which the name of Psyche was written, and every other particular re­ <lb/>
            specting her. Now, I think, it cannot be doubted that Synesius alludes <lb/>
            to this part of the fable, in the following passage from his treatise on <lb/>
            Dreams: ' When the soul descends spontaneously to its former life, with <lb/>
            mercenary views, it receives servitude as the reward of its mercenary <lb/>
            labours. But this is the intention of descent, that the soul may accom­ <lb/>
            plish a certain servitude to the nature of the universe, prescribed by the </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="126"/>
            apparently fought a severe battle. Nevertheless, some of the <lb/>
            more active spirits among them leaving the wounded at home <note type="footnote"> laws of Adrastia, or inevitable fate. Hence, when the soul is fascinated <lb/>
            with material endowments, she is affected in a manner similar to those <lb/>
            who, though born free, are, for a certain time, hired to employments, <lb/>
            and, in this condition, captivated by the beauty of seme female servant, <lb/>
            determine to act in a menial capacity, under the master of their beloved <lb/>
            object. Thus, in a similar manner, when we are profoundly delighted <lb/>
            with external and corporeal good, we confess that the nature of matter <lb/>
            is beautiful, who marks our assent in her secret book ; and if, considering <lb/>
            ourselves as free, we at any time determine to depart, sAe proclaims us <lb/>
            deserters, and endeavours to bring us back, and, openly presenting her <lb/>
            mystic volume to the view, apprehends us, as fugitives from our mistress. <lb/>
            Then, indeed, the soul particularly requires fortitude and divine assistance, <lb/>
            as it is no trifling contest to abrogate the confession and compact which <lb/>
            she has made. Besides, in this case force will be employed; for the <lb/>
            material inflicters of punishments will then be roused to revenge, by the <lb/>
            decrees of fate, against the rebels to her laws.' </note><note type="footnote"> Venus, however, must not be considered here as the nature of matter; <lb/>
            for though she is not the celestial Venus, but the offspring of Dione, yet, <lb/>
            according to Proclus in Cratylum, she is that divine power which governs <lb/>
            all the co-ordinations in the celestial world and in the earth, binds them <lb/>
            to each other, and perfects their generative progressions, through a <lb/>
            kindred conjunction. As the celestial Venus, therefore, separates the <lb/>
            pure soul from generation, or the regions of sense, so she that proceeds <lb/>
            from Dione binds the impure soul, as her legitimate slave, to a corporeal <lb/>
            life. </note><note type="footnote"> After this, follows an account of the difficult tasks which Psyche is <lb/>
            obliged to execute, by the commands of Venus ; all which are images of <lb/>
            the mighty toils and anxious cares which the soul must necessarily endure <lb/>
            after her lapse, in order to atone for her guilt, and recover her ancient <lb/>
            residence in the intelligible world. In accomplishing the last of these <lb/>
            labours, she is represented as forced to descend even to the dark regions <lb/>
            of Hades, which indicates that the soul, through being enslaved to a cor. <lb/>
            poreal life, becomes situated in obscurity, and is deprived of the light of <lb/>

            bundles of plunder, which, as they said, they had concealed in <lb/>
            a certain cave. So having hastily devoured their dinner, they <lb/>
            turned me and my horse into the road, intending to load us with <lb/>
            those bundles; and striking us with staves, they marched us <lb/>
            over many ups and downs, and through many windings, until <lb/>
            we arrived, towards evening, very weary, at a certain cavern, <lb/>
            from whence they quickly brought us back, heavily loaded, <lb/>
            without having allowed us a moment's rest. Such was their <lb/>
            haste and trepidation, that they drove me by their blows <lb/>
            against a stone which lay in the road, and caused me to fall <lb/>
            down; and then the blows fell thicker and faster to compel <lb/>
            me to rise, which I could hardly do being severely hurt in <lb/>
            my off leg and near hoof. " How long," cried one of them, <lb/>
            " shall we waste food on this worn-out ass, and who is now <lb/>
            gone lame too r" " He has brought us ill-luck," said another ; <lb/>

            on the Elcusinian and Bacchic Mysteries. In the first place, then Plato <lb/>
            in book vii. of his Republic observes, ' that he who is not able, by the <lb/>
            exercise of his reason, to define the idea of the good, separating it from <lb/>
            all others, and piercing, as in a battle, through every kind of argument; <lb/>
            eagerly striving to confute, not according to opinion, but according to <lb/>
            essence, and in all these, marching forward with undeviating reason,- <lb/>
            such a one knows nothing of the good itself, nor of any good whatever; <lb/>
            but if he has attained to any image of the good, we must say he has at­ <lb/>
            tained to it by opinion, not by science; that in the present life he is <lb/>
            sleeping, and conversant with dreams, and that, before he is roused, lie <lb/>
            will descend to Hades, and there be profoundly and perfectly laid asleep. <lb/>
            And Plotinus, in Ennead. I. lib. viii. p. 80, says, ' The death of the soul <lb/>
            is for it, while merged, as it were, in the present body, to descend into <lb/>
            matter, and be filled with its impurity, and, after departing from this body, <lb/>
            to lie absorbed in its filth, till it returns to a superior condition, and ele­ <lb/>
            vates its eye from the overwhelming mire. For to be plunged into matter, <lb/>
            is to descend to Hades, and fall asleep.' </note><note type="footnote"> Cupid, however, or intellectual love, at length recovering his pristine <lb/>
            vigour, rouses Psyche, or the rational part of the soul, from her deadly <lb/>

            toils, she ascends to her native heaven, becomes lawfully united to Cupid, <lb/>
            (for, while descending, her union with him might be called illegitimate), <lb/>
            lives the life of the immortals, and the natural result of this union is <lb/>
            pleasure or delight. And thus much for an explanation of the fable ot <lb/>

            said a third, " as soon as he has brought home this burden, <lb/>
            which he carries so unwillingly, I will immediately hurl him <lb/>
            down a precipice as dainty food for vultures."</p>
          <p>While those mildest of men were debating with each other <lb/>
            about the death I was to die, we had now reached our home ; <lb/>
            for fear had made wings of my hoofs. Then having hastily <lb/>
            removed our burdens, and paying no attention to our wants, <lb/>
            nor even thinking of my death, they took their wounded com­ <lb/>
            rades with them and started off again, to make up, as they said, <lb/>
            for the time lost through my sluggishness.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile, I was made not a little uneasy by thoughts of <lb/>
            the death with which I was threatened; and I said to myself: <lb/>
            " Why do you stand still, Lucius ? Why do you tamely await <lb/>
            the last calamity that can befall you ? Death, and that of the <lb/>
            most cruel kind, is decreed for you by the robbers, nor is the <lb/>
            execution of the sentence a thing to cause them any great diffi­ <lb/>
            culty. You see those neighbouring precipices, and those sharp <lb/>
            rocks projecting from their sides, which, fall wherever you <lb/>
            may, will penetrate your body and tear you limb from limb. <lb/>
            For that illustrious magic you were so fond of has given <lb/>
            you only the form and the labours of an ass, but has invested <lb/>
            you not with the thick hide of that animal, but with the deli­ <lb/>
            cate skin of a horse-leech. Why do you not, therefore, assume <lb/>
            a masculine spirit, and consult your safety while yet you <lb/>
            may ? You have an excellent opportunity for flight while the <lb/>
            robbers are away. Are you afraid of a half-dead old woman, <lb/>
            whom you may finish with one blow of your lame foot ? But <lb/>
            whither on earth shall I fly, or who will receive me under his <lb/>
            roof? Nay, that is a stupid, and perfectly asinine reflection; <lb/>
            for where is the traveller who would not gladly ride off upon <lb/>
            a beast that fell in his way ?" And with that I made a strong <lb/>
            effort, broke the thong by which I was tied, and was off as <lb/>
            fast as my four legs could carry me.</p>
          <p>Yet I could not escape the hawk's eyes of the crafty old <lb/>
            woman; for, as soon as she saw me free, she laid hold of the <lb/>
            thong, with a boldness above her sex and age, and strove to <lb/>
            lead me back again. I, however, bearing in mind the deadly <lb/>
            purpose of the robbers, was moved by no pity, but immedi­ <lb/>
            ately knocked her down with a stroke of my hind feet. But <lb/>
            even when sprawling on the ground, she held on to the thong <lb/>
            with a tenacious gripe, so that for a while I dragged her along, <pb n="129"/>
            <note type="margin"> BOOK TI. </note> <lb/>
            in my gallop. She immediately began, too, with clamorous howl- <lb/>
            ings, to implore the assistance of a stronger hand; but all the <lb/>
            noise she made was of no use ; for there was no one but the <lb/>
            captive virgin that could afford her aid; and she, startled by <lb/>
            the uproar, ran out of the cave, and saw, by Hercules, a most <lb/>
            remarkable scene, the old woman, like another Dirce, only <lb/>
            hanging not to a bull, but to an ass.* Then did the virgin, <lb/>
            with virile daring, perform an admirable exploit. For, wrest­ <lb/>
            ing the thong from the hands of the old woman, she checked <lb/>
            my speed with bland words, mounted cleverly on my back, <lb/>
            and again incited me to hasten away. Besides my own spon­ <lb/>
            taneous desire to escape, I was now impelled by a wish to <lb/>
            liberate the virgin, and further urged by the blows with which <lb/>
            she frequently admonished me; so that my four feet beat the <lb/>
            ground at the rate of a courser's gallop; and all the while I <lb/>
            endeavoured to reply by my braying to the sweet words of the <lb/>
            virgin. Sometimes, also, turning my neck, and pretending to <lb/>
            scratch my back, I kissed her beautiful feet.</p>
          <p>At last, sighing deeply, and looking anxiously to heaven, <lb/>
            "0 ye Gods," she said, " give me your aid, now or never, <lb/>
            in my extreme danger; and thou, 0 cruel Fortune, now <lb/>
            cease thy rage. Thou hast surely been sufficiently appeased <lb/>
            by these my miserable torments. And you (addressing her­ <lb/>
            self to me), in whom I rely for liberty and life, if you <lb/>
            bring me home safe, and restore me to my parents and my <lb/>
            beautiful lover, what thanks shall I not give you, what honours <lb/>
            shall I not bestow upon you, and what food shall I not afford <lb/>
            you? In the first place, I will comb that mane of yours <lb/>
            nicely, and adorn it with my virgin hands; next, I will grace­ <lb/>
            fully part and curl the hairs that hang over your forehead; <lb/>
            and then I will, with all diligence, comb out and disentangle <lb/>
            the rough and matted bristles of your long-neglected tail. I <lb/>
            will stud you all over, my preserver, with many golden or­ <lb/>
            naments, which will make you as resplendent as the stars of <lb/>
            heaven ; I will lead you along in triumph, while the people <lb/>
            joyfully follow; and I will daily fatten you, bringing to you <lb/>

            You shall likewise be numbered among the miracles of anti­ <lb/>
            quity. For, from the example of your true history, we shall <lb/>
            believe that Phryxus crossed the sea on the back of a ram, that <lb/>
            Arion piloted a dolphin, and that Europa sat on a bull. And, <lb/>
            truly, if Jupiter lowed under the form of a bull, something <lb/>
            human or divine may be concealed in my ass."</p>
          <p>While the virgin ran on in this way, mingling frequent sighs <lb/>
            with her ebullitions of hope, we came to a certain place where <lb/>
            three roads met; and there, seizing me by the headstall, she <lb/>
            strove hard to turn me into the road on the right-hand, because <lb/>
            it led to the abode of her parents. But I, who knew that <lb/>
            the robbers had taken that path, in order to bring away the <lb/>
            remainder of their spoil, strenuously resisted, and thus silently, <lb/>
            in my own mind, expostulated with her: " What are you do­ <lb/>
            ing, 0 unhappy virgin ? What are you about ? Why will you <lb/>
            hasten to Hades ? What sort of use is this you want to make <lb/>
            of my feet ? You will be the cause not only of your own de­ <lb/>
            struction, but of mine likewise."</p>
          <p>While we were thus at variance about the road we should <lb/>
            take, and were contending like coheirs in a law-suit about the <lb/>
            lordship of the ground and the division of the path, the robbers, <lb/>
            laden with their plunder, perceived us, and recognizing us at <lb/>
            a considerable distance, by the light of the moon, saluted us <lb/>
            with a malignant laugh; and one of their number thus addressed <lb/>
            us : " Whither away so fast by moonlight ? Do you not fear <lb/>
            the shades and ghosts that roam by night ? Are you hasten­ <lb/>
            ing, most dutiful maiden, to pay a clandestine visit to your <lb/>
            parents ? Well, you shall not travel all alone, we will escort <lb/>
            you, and show you a shorter way to your friends." And with <lb/>
            that, he laid hold on my rein, and turned me round, at the <lb/>
            same time beating me unmercifully with the knotted staff he <lb/>
            sarried in his hand. Then I, returning full loth to prompt de- <pb n="131"/>
            <note type="margin"> BOOK VI. </note> <lb/>
            struction, recollected the pain of my hoof, and began to walk <lb/>
            lame, with my head bobbing up and down; upon which, said <lb/>
            the robber who had turned me back : ISo, then, you stumble <lb/>
            and stagger again. Your rotten feet are able to gallop away, <lb/>
            but cannot walk. Yet, just now, you surpassed the winged <lb/>
            speed of Pegasus."</p>
          <p>While my kind conductor thus jeered me, whacking me at <lb/>
            the same time with his staff, we had now arrived at the out­ <lb/>
            ward enclosure of the robbers' abode. And there, behold, we <lb/>
            found the old woman, with a rope tied about her neck, sus­ <lb/>
            pended from a branch of a lofty cypress tree. The robbers took <lb/>
            her down, and dragging her along by her own rope, pitched <lb/>
            her over the brink of a precipice. Then, having put the virgin <lb/>
            in chains, they fell savagely upon the supper which the un­ <lb/>
            happy old woman had prepared for them, with posthumous <lb/>
            diligence, as it were. And now, while they were devouring <lb/>
            everything with greedy voracity, they began to discuss the <lb/>
            question of our punishment, and their own revenge, and the <lb/>
            opinions expressed on the subject were various, as is usually <lb/>
            the case in a turbulent crowd. One proposed that the virgin <lb/>
            should be burnt alive; a second was for exposing her to wild <lb/>
            beasts; a third was of opinion that she should be crucified; <lb/>
            and a fourth, that she should be mangled by various torments. <lb/>
            At all events, she was condemned to die, in one way or other, <lb/>
            by the suffrage of all.</p>
          <p>At last one of them, having prevailed on the rest to cease <lb/>
            the tumult, addressed them thus, in a mild and placid tone : <lb/>
            " It does not accord with the ordinances of our association, <lb/>
            nor with the clemency of each of us, nor indeed with my <lb/>
            own moderation, to suffer you to inflict punishment which <lb/>
            exceeds the magnitude of the crime; nor that you should <lb/>
            employ for this purpose wild beasts, or the cross, or fire, or <lb/>
            torments, or invoke the hasty darkness of a rapid death. <lb/>
            Hearken, then, to my counsel, and grant life to the maiden, <lb/>
            but such life as she deserves. You have not, of course, forgotten <lb/>
            what you some time ago decreed respecting that ass, who was <lb/>
            always sluggish, indeed, but a prodigious eater, and who now <lb/>
            also has counterfeited lameness, and has made himself the in­ <lb/>
            strument and servant of the virgin's flight. It will be well, <lb/>
            therefore, to cut his throat to-morrow, and, having taken out <lb/>
            all his intestines, to sew up the virgin, naked, in the belly <note type="footnote"> K2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="132"/>
            of the ass, who has preferred her to us; so that, her face <lb/>
            alone may project and be visible, and the rest of her body <lb/>
            may be confined in the beastly embrace of his belly. Then <lb/>
            let the ass, with the virgin thus sewn up in him, be exposed, on <lb/>
            some stony cliff, to the heat of the burning sun. Thus both of <lb/>
            them will suffer everything which you have rightly decreed. <lb/>
            For the ass will be put to death, as he has long ago deserved; while <lb/>
            she will endure the bites of creatures of prey, when her limbs <lb/>
            are gnawed by worms; the scorching heat of fire, when the <lb/>
            blazing sun shall have burnt up the belly of the ass; and the <lb/>
            torment of the cross, when dogs and vultures tear out her en­ <lb/>
            trails. Reckon up, too, her other, miseries and torments. In <lb/>
            the first place, she will remain alive in the belly of a dead <lb/>
            beast; in the next place, her nostrils will be filled with a <lb/>
            most fetid vapour; and, in the third place, she will waste <lb/>
            away with protracted hunger, and will not have her hands at <lb/>
            liberty to end her agonies by death."</p>
          <p>After he had spoken to this effect, the robbers agreed to his <lb/>
            proposal, which they relished to their very heart's content. <lb/>
            On hearing their decision with my long cars, what could I do <lb/>
            but bewail my poor body that was to be a dead carcase next <lb/>
            morning ?</p>

            crowd of the citizens, and assuming the appearance of one who <lb/>
            was grieved and indignant at what had happened, observed <lb/>
            what course was taken for an investigation of the affair, and <lb/>
            whether, and to what extent, they would inquire after the <lb/>
            robbers; in order that I might relate to you every particular, <lb/>
            conformably to your injunctions. Now one Lucius, whoever <lb/>
            he may be, was accused, by the unanimous voice of all the mul­ <lb/>
            titude, as the manifest author of the robbery, and this not upon <lb/>
            dubious surmises, but upon convincing evidence. This Lucius, <lb/>
            not long before, by false commendatory letters, passing himself <lb/>
            off for a respectable man, strongly ingratiated himself with <lb/>
            Milo, so that he was hospitably received by him, and ranked <lb/>
            among his intimate friends. And when he had remained there <lb/>
            not a few days, having ensnared the mind of a maid servant of <lb/>
            Milo with false love, he diligently explored the bolts and bars <lb/>
            of the house, and curiously surveyed those parts of it in which <lb/>
            all the property was usually deposited. This, also, was con­ <lb/>
            sidered as no small indication of his guilt, that he fled on the <lb/>
            very same night, and at the very moment the robbery was <lb/>
            committed, and has not been heard of since. He had ready <lb/>
            means of flight too, whereby he could rapidly elude his pur­ <lb/>
            suers, and get farther and farther away from their search; for he <lb/>
            rode away on his own white horse. Moreover, his servant was <lb/>
            found in the same house, and, being accused as accessary to the <lb/>
            felony and escape of his master, was, by order of the magis­ <lb/>
            trates, committed to the common gaol, and subjected on the fol­ <lb/>
            lowing day to many torments. But though tortured till he <lb/>
             <pb n="134"/>
            was almost dead, he confessed, after all, nothing of the kind. <lb/>
            Nevertheless, many persons were sent to the country of tha' <lb/>
            Lucius in search of him, in order that he might undergo the <lb/>
            punishment of his crime."</p>
          <p>While he was narrating these things, my vitals were wrung <lb/>
            with grief at the comparison they suggested between my an­ <lb/>
            cient fortune and my present calamity, between that once <lb/>
            happy Lucius and a miserable jackass. It also occurred to me, <lb/>
            that not without reason had ancient sages pronounced Fortune <lb/>
            to be blind, and entirely deprived of eyes; since she always <lb/>
            bestows her riches on the unworthy and the wicked, and never <lb/>
            judiciously makes any mortal the object of her regard; but <lb/>
            indeed attaches herself for the most part to men from whom, <lb/>
            if she could see, she ought to By far away. And what is worst <lb/>
            of all, she causes opinions to be entertained of us that are at <lb/>
            variance with our real character, or even contrary to it; so as <lb/>
            to enable the bad man to exult in the renown of the good man, <lb/>
            and, on the other hand, to cause the most innocent to suffer <lb/>
            such punishment as befits the most guilty. Here, methought, <lb/>
            am I, to whom she has done her worst in changing me into a <lb/>
            beast, and a quadruped of the vilest condition, I, whose mis­ <lb/>
            fortune would strike the most hardened reprobate as worthy to <lb/>
            be lamented and commiserated, I am here accused of the crime of <lb/>
            burglary, committed upon my most dear host; a crime for which <lb/>
            burglary is too mild a name, and which one may more rightly <lb/>
            denominate parricide. Yet I was not permitted to defend <lb/>
            myself, or to utter so much as one word in denial of the charge. <lb/>
            Now, however, when it was made in my presence, lest my <lb/>
            silence should be mistaken for the acquiescence of a guilty <lb/>
            conscience, I was racked with impatience to speak, were it <lb/>
            only to say, Non feci, I did not do that deed. The former <lb/>
            word, indeed, [non] I roared out again and again, but the <lb/>
            other [feci] I could by no means pronounce, but I continued <lb/>
            to vociferate non non ; and no more could I get out, though I <lb/>
            made my pendulous lips vibrate with excessive rotundity.</p>
          <p>Why, however, do I prolixly complain of the spitefulness of <lb/>
            Fortune, since she was not ashamed to make me a fellow- <lb/>
            servant and yoke-mate with my own horse. While these <lb/>
            thoughts were floating through my mind, a concern of a more <lb/>
            important nature engaged my attention, viz., the recollection <lb/>
            that I was destined by the decree of the robbers to be a victim <pb n="135"/>
            <note type="margin"> BOOK VII. </note> <lb/>
            to the manes of the virgin; and frequently casting a look at <lb/>
            my belly, I seemed to myself to have the unhappy damsel <lb/>
            enclosed within it.</p>
          <p>The robber who had just brought t he news of that false <lb/>
            accusation against me, having drawn out a thousand pieces of <lb/>
            gold coin, which he had sewn up and concealed in his garment, <lb/>
            and which he had taken, as he said, from different travellers, <lb/>
            and had conscientiously brought to the common treasury, began <lb/>
            to inquire anxiously concerning the welfare of his comrades. <lb/>
            Finding that some of them, and indeed all the bravest, had <lb/>
            perished by various deaths, but all with great gallantry, he <lb/>
            advised them to leave the highways at peace for some time, <lb/>
            and rather apply themselves to searching after other associates, <lb/>
            and to supplying the deficiency of their warlike band by the <lb/>
            election of new hands from among the youths of the country. <lb/>
            For, he observed, those that were unwilling might be com­ <lb/>
            pelled by fear, and the willing be incited by reward; and not <lb/>
            a few would gladly abandon an abject and servile life, and <lb/>
            unite themselves to an association which possessed a power <lb/>
            like that of royalty. For his own part, he had some time <lb/>
            since met with a certain man of a lofty stature, young, of vast <lb/>
            bodily dimensions, and of great strength; and after much ar­ <lb/>
            gument had at length persuaded him to make better use of his <lb/>
            hands, which had become torpid through long idleness; to enjoy <lb/>
            while he might the advantages of a prosperous condition of <lb/>
            body; and instead of holding out his powerful hand for alms, <lb/>
            to exert it rather in helping himself to gold. All present <lb/>
            assented to what he said, and decreed to receive the man he had <lb/>
            spoken of, as he Appeared to be a tried man, and also to search <lb/>
            after others who might supply the places of those they had lost.</p>
          <p>He went out, and returning shortly after, brought with him, <lb/>
            as he had promised, a certain tall young man, with whom I do <lb/>
            not think any one present could have stood a comparison; for, <lb/>
            besides the great bulk of his body, he surpassed all the rest in <lb/>
            height by a whole head, and yet the down had but just begun <lb/>
            to overspread'his cheeks. He was only half clothed, with odds <lb/>
            and ends of cloth, cobbled together, through the joinings of <lb/>
            which his brawny breast and belly seemed ready to burst <lb/>
            forth. Thus entering, " All hail," said he, " ye, who are under <lb/>
            the protection of the most powerful God Mars, and who are <lb/>
            now become my trusty comrades; receive willingly a willing <lb/>
             <pb n="136"/>
            recruit, a man of magnanimous spirit, who more cheerfully <lb/>
            receives wounds in his body than gold in his hand, and who <lb/>
            despises death, which others dread. And think not that I am <lb/>
            a needy or abject man, nor judge of my merits from these <lb/>
            rags; for I have been the leader of a most powerful band, and <lb/>
            have, in fact, plundered all Macedonia. I am that famous <lb/>
            robber Hæmus the Thracian, whose name whole provinces <lb/>
            dread; and am the offspring of There, who was an equally <lb/>
            illustrious robber; nourished in human blood; educated among <lb/>
            bands of men of this description, and the heir and imitator of <lb/>
            my father's valour. But I lost in a short space of time all <lb/>
            my old band, all my brave comrades, and, all the great wealth <lb/>
            we had amassed. For passing by Oratum,* I attacked one of <lb/>
            Caesar's commissaries, who had been high in office, but was <lb/>
            afterwards deprived of his employment through the malignity <lb/>
            of fortune. I will, however, relate the whole affair in order <lb/>
            that you may understand it the better.</p>

          <p>" There was a certain person honourably distinguished by <lb/>
            the many offices he held in the palace of Caesar, and who was <lb/>
            also well esteemed by Cæsar himself. Malignant envy, and <lb/>
            the crafty accusations of certain persons, hurled him into exile. <lb/>
            But his wife, Plotina, a woman of rare fidelity and singular <lb/>
            chastity, who had given stability to the family of her husband <lb/>
            by the birth of ten children, spurned and despised the plea­ <lb/>
            sures of city luxury, and became the companion of her <lb/>
            husband's flight, and a partaker of his misfortune. For this <lb/>
            purpose she cut off her hair, changed her dress, so that she <lb/>
            might appear like a man; and begirt with necklaces of the <lb/>
            greatest value and with zones of gold coin, she moved intre­ <lb/>
            pidly amidst the drawn swords of the soldiers that guarded her <lb/>
            husband, a partaker of all his dangers, maintaining an ever- <lb/>
            wakeful care for his safety, and enduring continual labours <lb/>
            with the fortitude of a man. And now having vanquished the <lb/>
            greater part of the difficulties of the journey, and the dangers <lb/>
            of the sea, she went with her husband to Zacynthus, † which <note type="footnote"> * Oratum.]—The precise situation of Oratum has not been determined. </note><note type="footnote"> t Zacynthus.]—Now the island of Zante. </note> <pb n="137"/>
            <note type="margin"> BOOK VII. </note> <lb/>
            their fatal destiny had decreed to be their temporary habita­ <lb/>
            tion. As soon, however, as they had arrived on the shores of <lb/>
            Actium, where we were then roving about on our return <lb/>
            from Macedonia, they went late at night to a certain cottage <lb/>
            which was near the shore and their ship, and there they slept <lb/>
            in order to avoid the tossing of the sea. In this cottage we <lb/>
            attacked and plundered them of every thing. Yet we did not <lb/>
            depart without great danger. For as soon as the mistress of <lb/>
            the house heard the first noise of the gate, she ran into the <lb/>
            bedchamber, and disturbed all that were in the house by her <lb/>
            tumultuous clamours. She likewise called on her servants by <lb/>
            name, and on all her neighbours; but it so happened that we <lb/>
            escaped with impunity through the general fear, each conceal­ <lb/>
            ing himself out of regard to his own safety.</p>
          <p>" This excellent woman, however, (for the truth must be <lb/>
            spoken), who was a pattern of fidelity and was beloved for her <lb/>
            virtues, immediately pouring forth her prayers to the majesty <lb/>
            of Cæsar, obtained both a speedy return for her husband, and <lb/>
            a complete revenge of the assault. In short, Cæsar was un­ <lb/>
            willing that the band of the robber Hæmus should any longer <lb/>
            exist, and it was forthwith immediately destroyed. So much <lb/>
            can the mere wish of a great prince effect. At length, when, <lb/>
            by the pertinacious pursuit of the emperor's army, all our <lb/>
            band was destroyed, I scarcely saved myself, and escaped from <lb/>
            the midst of the jaws of hell, after the following manner. <lb/>
            I clothed myself in the florid vestment of a woman, with nume­ <lb/>
            rous flowing folds, covered my head with a small woven <lb/>
            mitre, and put on my feet those white and thin shoes which are <lb/>
            worn by women; and thus, as it were, implanted and concealed <lb/>
            in the other sex, I passed through the midst of the troops of <lb/>
            hostile soldiers, riding on an ass laden with sheaves of barley. <lb/>
            For, believing me to be a female ass-driver, they let me pass <lb/>
            free; because at that time my beardless cheeks were still soft <lb/>
            and smooth as a boy's. Yet I have not degenerated from my <lb/>
            paternal glory, or forgotten my fortitude, though somewhat <lb/>
            fearful in consequence of being placed in the midst of martial <lb/>
            blades ; but protected by the disguise of a dress foreign to my <lb/>
            sex, and attacking villas or towns, single handed, I have pro- <lb/>
            sured for myself this small viaticum by plunder."</p>
          <p>END OF THE SIXTH EPISODE.</p><pb n="138"/>
            
          <p>Ripping open his rags as he spoke, he poured forth into the <lb/>
            midst of them two thousand pieces of gold coin. "There," <lb/>
            said he, "I willingly offer to your band this contribution, <lb/>
            and myself also (if you do not reject my offer), as a most <lb/>
            faithful leader, who, in a short space of time, will make this <lb/>
            your habitation to be no longer rocky, but golden." The rob­ <lb/>
            bers, without hesitation, unanimously elected him their leader. <lb/>
            They also brought forth a tolerably fair garment, which he put <lb/>
            on, throwing away his rich rags. And having thus changed <lb/>
            his attire, and embraced each of them, he was placed on the <lb/>
            couch at the head of the table, and his leadership was inaugu­ <lb/>
            rated by a supper, and copious bowls.</p>
          <p>In the conversation that ensued, the robber was made aware <lb/>
            of the flight of the damsel, of my carrying her, and of the <lb/>
            monstrous death to which each of us was destined. He asked <lb/>
            where the virgin was, and being taken to her, and seeing her <lb/>
            laden with chains, he turned away from her, with a contemp­ <lb/>
            tuous curl of his nose, and said : "I am not indeed so stupid, <lb/>
            or at least so rash, as to oppose your decree; but I should have <lb/>
            to endure the reproaches of my own conscience, if I dissembled <lb/>
            what appears to me to be for your benefit. But, in the first <lb/>
            place, suffer me, who am solicitous for your sake, to speak <lb/>
            boldly, especially since, if my views are not acceptable to you, <lb/>
            you may fall back on what you have decreed concerning the <lb/>
            virgin and the ass. Now, I think that those robbers who are <lb/>
            truly wise ought to prefer nothing to their own gain, not even <lb/>
            vengeance itself, which is often detrimental to those who inflict <lb/>
            it as well as to others. If, then, you destroy the virgin in the <lb/>
            body of the ass, you will gratify nothing but your indig­ <lb/>
            nation, without any profit to yourselves. It is my opinion <lb/>
            that she should rather be taken to some city, and there sold; for <lb/>
            a virgin of her age may be sold for no small price. I myself, <lb/>
            some time ago, knew certain bawds, one of whom might, as I <lb/>
            think, give a great sum of money for this virgin, and place her <lb/>
            in a brothel, suitable to her birth, and from which she will not <lb/>
            be likely to run away again. She will also have afforded you <lb/>
            some revenge, when she has passed into bondage at a brothel. <lb/>
            I have sincerely offered this counsel to you, as conducive to <lb/>
            your advantage ; but you are the masters of your own judg­ <lb/>
            ments and acts." Thus it was that this advocate of the rob­ <lb/>
            bers' exchequer, and no less excellent saviour of the virgin and <lb/>
            ass, pleaded our cause.</p><pb n="139"/>
            
          <p><note type="margin">BOOK VII. </note> The rest of the robbers, after tormenting my entrails and my <lb/>
            miserable spirit by their tedious deliberations, at length cor­ <lb/>
            dially acceded to the opinion of the new robber, and immedi­ <lb/>
            ately freed the virgin from her bonds. But as for her, from <lb/>
            the moment she beheld that young man, and heard him men­ <lb/>
            tion a brothel and a bawd, she began to be elated, and to smile <lb/>
            most joyfully, so that I felt inclined, with good reason, to vitu­ <lb/>
            perate the whole sex, when I saw a virgin, who pretended that <lb/>
            she was enamoured of a young lover, and was desirous of a <lb/>
            chaste marriage, now suddenly delighted with the name of a <lb/>
            vile and filthy brothel. It was a case in which the character of <lb/>
            the whole female sex was in question, and the verdict de­ <lb/>
            pended on the judgment of an ass. The young man, how­ <lb/>
            ever, resuming his discourse, said : " Why do we not proceed <lb/>
            to supplicate Mars to be propitious to us in selling the virgin, <lb/>
            and searching for other associates ? But, as far as I see, we <lb/>
            have not any beast for sacrifice, nor sufficient wine for drink­ <lb/>
            ing largely. Send with me, therefore, ten of our comrades, <lb/>
            with whom I may go to the next town, and bring you thence <lb/>
            meat and drink fit for priests." Accordingly, he departed, <lb/>
            attended by ten of the robbers, and the rest prepared a great <lb/>
            fire, and raised an altar of green turf to the god Mars.</p>
          <p>The foragers soon returned, bringing with them skins full <lb/>
            of wine, and driving before them a great number of cattle; from <lb/>
            among which they selected a large he-goat, old and shaggy, <lb/>
            and sacrificed it to Mars the Secutor* and Associate. A <lb/>
            sumptuous supper was immediately prepared. Then the stran­ <lb/>
            ger said: "You must consider me as a strenuous leader not <lb/>
            only of your plundering expeditions, but also of your pleasures." <lb/>
            And with that he went cleverly to work, and performed every <lb/>
            thing that was requisite with admirable dexterity. He swept <lb/>
            the floor, made the couches smooth, cooked the meat, seasoned <lb/>
            the dishes, and served them up handsomely; but especially <lb/>
            he plied each of them, and that frequently, with large bowls <lb/>
            of wine. Nevertheless, under pretence of fetching what <lb/>
            he wanted from time to time, he often went to the virgin, <lb/>
            and gaily presented her with fragments which he had se­ <lb/>
            cretly taken away, and cups of wine, of which he had pre­ <lb/>
            viously tasted. And she most willingly received what he <lb/>
            brought her, and sometimes, when he wished to kiss her, she <lb/>
            readily responded to his wish, and kissed him. quite lovingly <note type="footnote"> * 3. The gladiator, or sword-player. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="140"/>
            These things greatly displeased me; and I said to myself: <lb/>
            Shame upon you, girl, do you forget your faithful lover and <lb/>
            your nuptials ? Do you prefer this foreign and cruel homicide <lb/>
            to that young man, whoever he be, to whom your parents have <lb/>
            betrothed you ? Does not your conscience prick you, that you <lb/>
            thus trample on affection, and are pleased to act libidinously <lb/>
            among gleaming spears and swords ? What if the other rob­ <lb/>
            bers, likewise, should, by some means or other, perceive what <lb/>
            you are doing, would you not again return to the ass, and again <lb/>
            procure my destruction? Really you are playing your game <lb/>
            at the risk of another's skin.</p>
          <p>Whilst I was thus cogitating in great indignation, and falsely <lb/>
            accusing the virgin in my own mind, I gathered from certain <lb/>
            words of theirs, which though dubious, were not obscure to an <lb/>
            intelligent ass, that the young man was not the famous robber <lb/>
            Hsemus, but Tlepolemus, the bridegroom of the virgin. For, <lb/>
            in the course of their conference, caring nothing for my pre­ <lb/>
            sence, he said somewhat more distinctly: " Be of good cheer, <lb/>
            dearost Charite; for you shall presently have all these your <lb/>
            enemies in captivity." And I observed that while he himself <lb/>
            refrained from drinking immoderately, he never ceased to ply <lb/>
            the robbers more and more with wine, now unmingled with <lb/>
            water, and moderately heated, so that they began to be over­ <lb/>
            come with intoxication. And, by Hercules, I suspect that <lb/>
            he had mingled in their cups a certain soporiferous drug. At <lb/>
            last, when they all, without a single exception, lay dead drunk <lb/>
            on the floor, then Tlepolemus, having without any difficulty <lb/>
            bound them strongly with ropes, and tied them together as he <lb/>
            thought proper, placed the damsel on my back, and directed <lb/>
            his steps to his own home.</p>
          <p>As soon as we arrived there, the whole city turned out at <lb/>
            the wished-for sight. Parents, kindred, retainers, bondmen, <lb/>
            and servants, joyfully ran out to meet us. You might see a <lb/>
            procession of every age and sex, and, by Hercules, a new and <lb/>
            memorable spectacle, a virgin riding in triumph on an ass.* As <lb/>
            for myself, rejoicing with all my might, and not choosing to <lb/>
            be at variance with the present display, as if I had no concern <lb/>
            in it, I brayed strenuously, with erect ears and expanded nos­ <lb/>
            trils, or rather, I trumpeted with a noise like thunder. <note type="footnote"> * Riding in triumph on an ass.]—It has been conjectured that the <lb/>

          <p><note type="margin"> BOOK VII. </note> The damsel having now retired to her chamber, where her <lb/>
            parents cherished and caressed her, Tlepolemus immediately <lb/>
            took me back to the cave, accompanied by a great number of <lb/>
            beasts of burden, and a multitude of his fellow-citizens. Nor <lb/>
            did I return unwillingly; for, curious at all times, I was then <lb/>
            particularly desirous to be a spectator of the captivity of the <lb/>
            robbers, whom we found still fast bound, with wine even more <lb/>
            than with ropes. Having, therefore, ransacked the cave, and <lb/>
            brought out every thing that was in it, and we, and all the <lb/>
            rest being loaded with gold and silver, Tlepolemus and his at­ <lb/>
            tendants rolled some of the robbers, bound as they were, over <lb/>
            the neighbouring cliffs, and others they beheaded with their <lb/>
            own swords. Then we returned to the city, exulting and re­ <lb/>
            joicing in so complete a revenge. The robbers' wealth was <lb/>
            deposited in the public treasury; but the damsel, who had been <lb/>
            recovered by Tlepolemus, was given to him according to law.</p>
          <p>Then that noble woman paid the greatest attention to me, <lb/>
            whom she called her saviour; and, on the very day of her <lb/>
            nuptials, ordered my manger to be completely filled with bar­ <lb/>
            ley, and as much hay to be given me as would be enough for <lb/>
            a Bactrian eamel. But what sufficiently dire execrations could <lb/>
            I imprecate on Fotis, who had transformed me not into a dog, <lb/>
            but an ass, when I saw all the dogs stuffed and crammed with <lb/>
            the relics of the most abundant supper, and with the food they <lb/>
            had pillaged ? After the first night, the bride did not cease <lb/>
            to tell her parents and her husband how greatly she was in­ <lb/>
            debted to me, till they promised that they would confer on me <lb/>
            the- highest honours. Convoking, therefore, their most inti­ <lb/>
            mate friends, they held a consultation as to how I might most <lb/>
            worthily be rewarded. One was of opinion that I should be <lb/>
            shut up in the house, and there, leading an idle life, be fattened <lb/>
            with choice barley, beans, and vetches. But the opinion of <lb/>
            another prevailed, who regarded my liberty, and persuaded <lb/>
            them rather to give me the run of the plains and meadows, <lb/>
            where I might take ray pleasure among the herds of horses, <lb/>
            and procreate many mules, for the masters of the mares. <lb/>
            The keeper of the horses was accordingly summoned, and <lb/>
            I was delivered over to him, with many injunctions that <lb/>
            he should take care of me. And right gaily did I trot <lb/>
            along by his side, rejoicing at the thought that I was now <lb/>
            to have nothing more to do with packs and bags, and so <lb/>
            forth, and that having obtained my liberty, I should doubtless <lb/>
             <pb n="142"/>
            find some roses in the meadows, when they began to blossom <lb/>
            in spring. Frequently, too, it occurred to me, that since such <lb/>
            great marks of gratitude and so many honours were conferred <lb/>
            on me when but an ass, so much the greater would be the re­ <lb/>
            spect and favour shown me when I had recovered the human <lb/>
            form.</p>
          <p>But when the keeper of the horses had taken me to the <lb/>
            country, I found there none of the pleasure or the liberty I ex­ <lb/>
            pected. For his wife, an avaricious, bad woman, immediately <lb/>
            yoked me to the mill, and frequently striking me with a green <lb/>
            stick, prepared bread for herself and her family at the expense <lb/>
            of my hide. And not content to make me drudge for her own <lb/>
            food only, she also ground corn for her neighbours, and so made <lb/>
            money by my toil. Nor, after all my weary labours, did she <lb/>
            even afford me the food which had been ordered for me; for <lb/>
            she sold my barley to the neighouring husbandmen, after it had <lb/>
            been bruised and ground in that very mill, by ray own round­ <lb/>
            about drudgery; but to me, who had worked during the whole <lb/>
            of the day at that laborious machine, she only gave, towards <lb/>
            evening, some dirty, unsifted, and very gritty bran. I was <lb/>
            brought low enough by these miseries ; but cruel Fortune ex­ <lb/>
            posed me to fresh torments, in order, I suppose, that I might <lb/>
            boast of my brave deeds, both in peace and war, as the saying <lb/>
            is. For that excellent equerry, complying, rather late, indeed, <lb/>
            with his master's orders, for a short time permitted me to as­ <lb/>
            sociate with the herds of horses.</p>
          <p>At length a free ass, I capered for joy, and softly ambling <lb/>
            up to the mares, chose out such as I thought would be the <lb/>
            fittest for my concubines. But here my joyful hopes gave <lb/>
            place to extreme danger. For the stallions, who had been fed <lb/>
            high for the sake of copulating with the mares, and who, <lb/>
            independently of this, were terribly strong creatures, more <lb/>
            than a match for any ass, regarding me with suspicion, and <lb/>
            anxious to preserve the purity of their race, furiously pursued <lb/>
            me as their rival, without respect for the laws of hospitable <lb/>
            Jupiter. One of them, with his head and neck and ample <lb/>
            chest aloft, struck at me like a pugilist with his forefeet; <lb/>
            another, turning his brawny back, let fly at me with his <lb/>
            hind feet; and another, with a vicious neigh, his ears thrown <lb/>
            back, and showing his white teeth, sharp as spears, bit me all <lb/>
            over. It was like what I have read in history of the King of <pb n="143"/>
            <note type="margin"> BOOK VII. </note> <lb/>
            Thrace,* who exposed his unhappy guests to be lacerated and <lb/>
            devoured by wild horses. For so sparing was that power­ <lb/>
            ful tyrant of his barley, that he appeased the hunger of his <lb/>
            voracious horses by casting human bodies to them for food. <lb/>
            In fact, I was so worried and distracted by the continual <lb/>
            attacks of the horses, that I wished myself bark again at the <lb/>
            mill round.</p>
          <p>Fortune, however, who could not be satiated with my tor­ <lb/>
            ments, 'soon after visited me with another calamity. For I <lb/>
            was employed to bring home wood from a mountain, and a <lb/>
            boy, the most villanous of all boys, was appointed to drive <lb/>
            me. It was not only that I was wearied by toiling up and <lb/>
            down the steep and lofty mountain, nor that I wore away my <lb/>
            hoofs by running on sharp stones, but I was cudgelled without <lb/>
            end, so that all my bones ached to the very marrow. More­ <lb/>
            over, by continually striking me on the off-haunch, and <lb/>
            always in the same place, till the skin was broken, he occa­ <lb/>
            sioned a great ulcerous cavity, gaping like a trench or a <lb/>
            window; yet he never ceased to hit me on the raw. He <lb/>
            likewise laid such a load of wood on my back, that you <lb/>
            might have thought it was a burden prepared for an elephant, <lb/>
            and not for a jackass. And whenever the ill-balanced load <lb/>
            inclined to one side, instead of taking away some of the <lb/>
            faggots from the heavier side, and thus easing me by somewhat <lb/>
            lightening, or at least equalizing the pressure, he always <lb/>
            remedied the inequality of the weight by the addition of stones. <lb/>
            Nor yet, after so many miseries which I had endured, was he <lb/>
            content with the immoderate weight of my burden; but when <lb/>
            it happened that we had to pass over a river, he would leap on <lb/>
            my back in order to keep his feet dry, as if his weight was <lb/>
            but a trifling addition to the heavy mass. And if by any acci­ <lb/>
            dent I happened to fall, through the weight of my burden, and <lb/>
            the slipperiness of the muddy bank, instead of giving me a <lb/>
            helping hand as he ought to have done, and pulling me up by <lb/>
            the headstall, or by my tail, or removing a part of my load, <lb/>
            till at least I had got up again; this paragon of ass-drivers <lb/>
            gave me no help at all, however weary I might be, but begin­ <lb/>
            ning from my head, or rather from my ears, he thrashed all the <lb/>
            hair off my hide with a huge stick, till the blows stirred me <lb/>
            up and served me instead of a stimulating medicament. <note type="footnote"> * Diomede, Vid. Hygin, Fab. 30, et Ovid. in lbin. v. 381. </note> <pb n="144"/>
            </p>
          <p>Another piece of cruelty he practised on me, was this. He <lb/>
            twisted together a bundle of the sharpest and most venomous <lb/>
            thorns, and tied them to my tail as a pendulous torment; so <lb/>
            that, jerking against me when I walked, they pricked and <lb/>
            stabbed me intolerably. Hence, I was in a sore dilemma. <lb/>
            For when I ran away from him, to escape his unmerciful <lb/>
            drubbings, I was hurt by the more vehement pricking of the <lb/>
            thorns; and if I stood still for a short time, in order to avoid <lb/>
            that pain, I was compelled by blows to go on. In fact, the <lb/>
            rascally boy seemed to think of nothing else than how he <lb/>
            might be the death of me by some means or other; and that he <lb/>
            sometimes threatened with oaths to accomplish. And, indeed, <lb/>
            there happened a thing by which his detestable malice was <lb/>
            stimulated to more baneful efforts ; for on a certain day, when <lb/>
            his excessive insolence had overcome my patience, I lifted <lb/>
            up my powerful heels against him ; and for this he retaliated <lb/>
            by the following atrocity. He brought me into the road <lb/>
            heavily laden with a bundle of coarse flax, securely bound <lb/>
            together with cords, and placed in the middle of the burden a <lb/>
            burning coal, which he had stolen from the neighbouring <lb/>
            village. Presently the fire spread through the slender fibres, <lb/>
            flames burst forth, and I was all over in a blaze. There <lb/>
            appeared no refuge from immediate destruction, no hope of <lb/>
            safety, and such a conflagration did not admit of delay, or <lb/>
            afford time for deliberation. Fortune, however, shone upon <lb/>
            me in these cruel circumstances ; perhaps for the purpose of <lb/>
            reserving me for future dangers, but, at all events, liberating <lb/>
            me from present and decreed death.</p>
          <p>For by chance perceiving a neighbouring pool muddy with <lb/>
            the rain of the preceding day, I threw myself headlong into <lb/>
            it; and the flame being immediately extinguished, I came out, <lb/>
            lightened of my burden, and liberated from destruction. But <lb/>
            that audacious young rascal threw the blame of this most <lb/>
            wicked deed of his on me, and affirmed to all the shepherds, <lb/>
            that as I was passing near the neighbours' fires, I stumbled on <lb/>
            purpose, and set my load in a blaze ; and he added, laughing <lb/>
            at me, "How long shall we waste food on this fiery monster?"</p>
          <p>A few days after this, he had recourse to still worse artifices <lb/>
            against me. After having sold my load of wood at the nearest <lb/>
            cabin, he led me home unladen, declaring that he could not <lb/>
            mar age so vicious a brute, and that he renounced the miserable <pb n="145"/>
            <note type="margin"> BOOK VII. </note> <lb/>
            office of being my driver. " Look at that lazy, crawling, <lb/>
            out-and-out jackass," said he. " Besides all his other miss- <lb/>
            deeds, he is now worrying me with new ones that put me in <lb/>
            mortal fear. For whenever he sees a traveller, be it a comely <lb/>
            woman, or a marriageable girl, or a tender youth, he imme­ <lb/>
            diately makes at them as if he was mad, upsetting his burden, <lb/>
            and sometimes pitching off his very pack-saddle, and throws <lb/>
            them down with abominable intentions, makes up his great <lb/>
            ugly mouth as if to kiss them, and bites and tramples them <lb/>
            most indecently. All this occasions us no small strife and <lb/>
            quarrels, and will perhaps bring us into trouble with the ma­ <lb/>
            gistrates. Just now, espying a decent young woman, this <lb/>
            frolicksome gallant ran at her, scattering all his wood, threw <lb/>
            her down in the mud, and wanted to have his wicked will of <lb/>
            her there and then. Had not her shrieks brought some people <lb/>
            to her help, who were passing that way, and who snatched her <lb/>
            half dead from under his hoofs, she must have died a horrible <lb/>
            death, and left us to suffer the last penalty of the law."</p>
          <p>With these and other such lies, which hurt my modesty the <lb/>
            more because I could not reply to them, he desperately incensed <lb/>
            the herdsmen against me. At last said one of them, " Why <lb/>
            do we not immolate as he deserves this public paramour, this <lb/>
            universal adulterer ? Hark ye, boy ; cut off his head, throw <lb/>
            his entrails to the dogs, and keep his flesh to feed the work­ <lb/>
            people ; then we will carry his skin, well rubbed with ashes <lb/>
            and dried, to our master, and easily make up a story of his <lb/>
            having been killed by a wolf.</p>
          <p>Without delay my villanous accuser prepared joyfully to <lb/>
            execute the herdsman's sentence with his own hand, and began <lb/>
            to sharpen his knife on a whetstone, mocking, my woe, and <lb/>
            maliciously calling to mind the kick I had given him, and which, <lb/>
            by Hercules ! I wished had finished him. But one of the <lb/>
            rustics exclaimed that it was a shame to slaughter so fine an <lb/>
            ass. " Why lose the services of so useful a beast," he said, <lb/>
            " merely because he is too lustful ? Only geld him, and he <lb/>
            can no how play his pranks any more ; we shall be safe from <lb/>
            danger on his account, and besides, he will grow stouter and <lb/>
            fatter than ever. I have known many an animal, not asses <lb/>
            merely, but even high-spirited horses, that were so hot after <lb/>
            mares, as to be quite furious and unmanageable, and which, <lb/>
            after being cut, became quiet and fit to carry loads or do any- <note type="footnote"> L </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="146"/>
            thing else that was required of them. So if you have no ob­ <lb/>
            jection to what I say, after I have been to the market, which <lb/>
            will not detain me long, I will fetch the implements from home, <lb/>
            and immediately come back and geld this terrible rude gallant, <lb/>
            and make him gentler than any wether."</p>
          <p>Snatched by this proposal from the very clutches of death, <lb/>
            but reserved for a most cruel punishment, I grieved as though <lb/>
            I were about to perish wholly in losing an appendage to my <lb/>
            body, and thought of destroying myself by continual fasting, <lb/>
            or by leaping down a precipice: in that way I should die <lb/>
            none the less, but I should die entire. Whilst I was pondering <lb/>
            my choice of deaths, morning came again, and that boy, who <lb/>
            was my tormentor, led me as usual up the mountain, where <lb/>
            fastening me to a branch of great oak, he went a little way off, <lb/>
            and began to cut down a load of wood with his axe. Just <lb/>
            then, I saw a horrid bear lift up its great head, and creep out <lb/>
            of a cave close by. Appalled at the sudden sight, I started <lb/>
            back, sinking down with all my might upon my haunches, <lb/>
            while my head and neck were held up by the thong, until it <lb/>
            broke ; whereupon I dashed down the mountains, not on my feet <lb/>
            only, but projecting myself bodily, reached the plains beneath, <lb/>
            and scoured across them, running with all my might from the <lb/>
            dreadful bear, and the boy that was worse than the bear.</p>
          <p>A man who was passing that way, seeing me roam at large, <lb/>
            caught me, got on my back, and thumping me with a stick, <lb/>
            turned me into a side road unknown to me. I carried him <lb/>
            along with good will, thinking I was running away from that <lb/>
            cruel operation, and caring little about the blows I received, <lb/>
            for I was used to that sort of thing. But Fortune, with her <lb/>
            inveterate malice, anticipated so opportune a chance of escape, <lb/>
            and gave me over to fresh sufferings. For my master's herds­ <lb/>
            men having gone out in all directions to look for a stray heifer, <lb/>
            Happened to fall in with us, and seizing me by the head stall, <lb/>
            which they readily identified, they began to lead me away. <lb/>
            My rider, however, making a bold resistance, called gods and <lb/>
            men to witness against them. " Why do you pull me about in <lb/>
            this violent way ?" he said, " Why do you lay hands on me ?"</p>
          <p>"Do we behave unjustly to you," said- the herdsmen, <lb/>
            " when we find you making off with our ass ? Tell us where <lb/>
            you have hid the body of his driver, whom you have killed, no <lb/>
            doubt." So saying, they knocked him to the ground, and <pb n="147"/>
            <note type="margin"> BOOK VII. </note> <lb/>
            kicked and pummelled him with their fists, he swearing all <lb/>
            the while that he had seen no one with the ass, but had found <lb/>
            it running away, alone, and had caught it, that he might restore <lb/>
            it to its owner, and be rewarded for his trouble.</p>
          <p>" Would to heaven!" he cried, " that I had never seen this <lb/>
            ass, or that he could speak with a human voice, and bear testi­ <lb/>
            mony to my innocence. You would surely be ashamed of the <lb/>
            way in which you treat me."</p>
          <p>But all his protestations were of no avail, for the angry <lb/>
            herdsmen marched him along, with a rope round his neck, to <lb/>
            the forest on the mountain, where the boy used to fetch wood. <lb/>
            He was no where to be found; but at last they discovered what <lb/>
            were plainly the remains of his body, torn to pieces and strewed <lb/>
            here and there. I knew well it was the bear's teeth had done <lb/>
            this, and I would certainly have said so, had I possessed the fa­ <lb/>
            culty of speech. All I could do was to rejoice silently at seeing <lb/>
            myself revenged at last.</p>
          <p>After they had with much pains collected the scattered frag­ <lb/>
            ments of the body, they buried them on the spot, and marched <lb/>
            my Belerophon* to their cottages, there to remain tied fast, as <lb/>
            a thief taken in the fact, and a bloody assassin, until they de­ <lb/>
            livered him up next morning, for condign punishment, into the <lb/>
            hands of the magistrates. Meanwhile, in the midst of the <lb/>
            lamentations raised by the parents of the dead boy, up came <lb/>
            that rustic who had promised to perform the operation upon me, <lb/>
            and who now proposed to keep his word. " Our present loss is <lb/>
            not of his causing," said one of the byestanders; " nevertheless <lb/>
            you may cut what you please to-morrow from this villanous <lb/>
            jackass—his head if you have a mind, and you shall not want <lb/>
            for help."</p>
          <p>Thus it came to pass that my calamity was postponed for <lb/>
            another day, and I gave thanks to that kind boy, whose death, <lb/>
            at all events, procured me one little day's respite from the knife. <lb/>
            But I was not allowed even that short space of time to be <lb/>
            grateful to him or to enjoy repose ; for his mother rushed into <lb/>
            my stable, weeping and bewailing her son's premature death, <lb/>
            dressed in a black robe, tearing out her white hair, bestrewed <lb/>
            with ashes, and vehemently beating her breasts. <note type="footnote"> *My Belerophon.]—Lucius jocularly compares his rider to Belerophon, <lb/>
            and himself, by implication, to the winged steed Pegasus, which that here <lb/>

            </p>
          <p>" Look at him," she screamed, " how easily he takes it, that <lb/>
            cursed ass, with his head stuck in the manger, indulging his <lb/>
            gluttony, and for ever stuffing his insatiable belly. He has <lb/>
            no pity for my affliction, nor does he bestow a thought upon the <lb/>
            horrible fate of his deceased driver; no, he despises my age and <lb/>
            weakness, and thinks that he shall get off with impunity after <lb/>
            his enormous crime; perhaps he has the audacity to suppose <lb/>
            he shall be thought innocent; for it is the nature of the worst <lb/>
            criminals to expect impunity, even in spite of the reproaches of <lb/>
            their own guilty conscience. Now, in the name of all the Gods, <lb/>
            most infamous of quadrupeds, though you could borrow the <lb/>
            use of speech for a while, do you think you could persuade any <lb/>
            one, aye the veriest fool, that you were without fault in that <lb/>
            horrid disaster, when you could have fought for my poor boy, <lb/>
            and defended him with heels and teeth ? You could often lift <lb/>
            your heels against himself; why could you not use them with <lb/>
            the same alacrity in his defence ? You should have galloped off <lb/>
            with him on your back, and saved him from the bloody hands <lb/>
            of the robber; above all, you should not have fled alone, after <lb/>
            throwing and deserting your fellow-servant, your conductor, <lb/>
            your comrade, the friend who fed you. Do you not know that <lb/>
            those who refuse help to persons in mortal peril are punished, . <lb/>
            because therein they offend against all good principles ? But you <lb/>
            shall no longer rejoice over my calamities, murderer that you <lb/>
            are; I will let you know what strength there is in violent <lb/>
            grief."</p>
          <p>So saying, she took off her girdle, and tied my feet separately, <lb/>
            and as tightly as she could, so as to deprive me of the means <lb/>
            of revenging myself. Then snatching up a great stake, which <lb/>
            was used to bar the stable door, she never ceased whacking me <lb/>
            with it until her strength was quite spent, and it fell from her <lb/>
            wearied hands. Then complaining of the too speedy ex­ <lb/>
            haustion of her arms, she ran back into the house, fetched a <lb/>
            live coal from the hearth, and thrust it between my thighs; <lb/>
            until, employing the only means of defence left me, I squirted <lb/>
            a volley of liquid ordure into her face and eyes, and thus put­ <lb/>
            ting her to the rout, blinded and stinking, I saved myself from <lb/>
            destruction; otherwise the ass would have perished like another <lb/>

          <p>AT that time of the night when the cocks crow, a young man <lb/>
            came from the next city, who, as I perceived, was one of the <lb/>
            servants of that virgin Charite, who had endured equal sorrows <lb/>
            with myself among the robbers. Sitting near the fire, in the <lb/>

            wonderful and execrable particulars of her death, and the de­ <lb/>

            by a most grievous catastrophe. Yet she did not depart to the <lb/>

          </ab>
          <p>" There was a young man in the next city, whose name was <lb/>
            Thrasyllus, of noble birth, of knightly rank, and very rich ; <lb/>
            but he was a man addicted to the luxury of taverns, and to <lb/>
            harlots, and potations by day. On this account he iniquitously <note type="footnote"> will live as long as this brand lasts." As soon as they were gone, Althea <lb/>
            rose, took the brand off the fire, extinguished it, and put it carefully <lb/>
            away. When Meleager was grown up, he slew the famous boar that ra <lb/>
            vaged all the country of Calydonia, and presented its head to Atalanta <lb/>
            Althea's two brothers wanted the head, and quarrelled for it with Meleager, <lb/>
            who killed them both. To revenge their death, Althea slowly burned the <lb/>
            fatal brand, and so caused her son to die in lingering torture. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="150"/>
            associated with a factious band of robbers, and his hands were <lb/>
            dyed with human blood. Such was the man, and such was <lb/>
            the report concerning him. Now, as soon as Charite was mar­ <lb/>
            riageable, he was among her principal suitors, and most ar­ <lb/>
            dently endeavoured to obtain her in wedlock. And, though <lb/>
            he surpassed in nobility all the rest of her lovers, and solicited <lb/>
            her parents with splendid gifts, yet he was rejected by them, <lb/>
            on account of his morals, and suffered the disgrace of a repulse. <lb/>
            When, therefore, Charite, my master's daughter, came into the <lb/>
            hands of the worthy Tlepolemus, Thrasyllus, though disap­ <lb/>
            pointed in his hopes, yet firmly cherishing his love, and adding <lb/>
            to his passion the rage he felt on account of his rejected suit, <lb/>
            sought for an opportunity of perpetrating a bloody deed. At <lb/>
            length, a seasonable occasion presenting itself, he prepared to <lb/>
            execute the wickedness which had for a long time been the <lb/>
            subjects of his thoughts. On the day on which the virgin had <lb/>
            been liberated, by the cunning and fortitude of her spouse, <lb/>
            from the deadly swords of the robbers, he mingled with the <lb/>
            crowd of those that congratulated her, and made himself re­ <lb/>
            markable by the exulting joy he professed in the present safety <lb/>
            of the new married pair, and in the hopes of their future off­ <lb/>
            spring. Hence, being received into our house, among the <lb/>
            principal guests, as the nobility of his race demanded, and con­ <lb/>
            cealing his wicked designs, he falsely personated the character <lb/>
            of a most faithful friend.</p>
          <p>" And now, gradually ingratiating himself more and more <lb/>
            by his assiduity, by frequent conversation, and sometimes also <lb/>
            by sitting as a guest at the young couple's table, he fell, by <lb/>
            imperceptible degrees, into deeper love than ever. Nor is this <lb/>
            wonderful, since the flame of love, small at first, delights with <lb/>
            a gentle glow ; but, when fanned by continued familiar inter­ <lb/>
            course, it waxes fierce, and burns a man up wholly. Thra­ <lb/>
            syllus for a long time pondered how he might find an oppor­ <lb/>
            tune place for clandestine conference. He perceived that he <lb/>
            was more and more excluded from the avenues to an adulterous <lb/>
            intercourse by the multitude of observers, and that the strong <lb/>
            bonds of a new and increasing affection could not be severed; <lb/>
            and, further, that even if Charite were willing to comply with <lb/>
            his desires, which she never would be, her ignorance of the <lb/>
            art of deceiving a husband would hinder such a purpose. Yet, <lb/>
            in spite of all these obstacles, ho was bent with desperate ob- <pb n="151"/>
            <note type="margin"> BOOK VIII. </note> <lb/>
            stinacy on the accomplishment of what was impossible, as <lb/>
            though it had not been so. Things which seem difficult in the <lb/>
            beginning of love, appear easy when it has been strengthened <lb/>
            by time. Hear now, and carefully note, I pray you, to what <lb/>
            deed he was driven by the violence of his furious lust.</p>
          <p>" One day Tlepolemus, accompanied by Thrasyllus, went to <lb/>
            hunt wild beasts, if, indeed, the roe comes under that denomi­ <lb/>
            nation ; for Charite would not allow her husband to pursue <lb/>
            beasts armed with tusk or horn. The toils were spread round <lb/>
            a hill thickly covered with trees, and the high-bred hounds <lb/>
            were turned in to rouse the beasts from their lairs. Their good <lb/>
            training was immediately seen, for they spread abroad so as to <lb/>
            enclose every avenue. For a while they followed the scent in <lb/>
            silence, till at last one gave tongue, and then they all burst out <lb/>
            with impetuous, dissonant yells, that made everything ring <lb/>
            again. But it was not a roebuck, nor a timid doe, nor a hind, <lb/>
            the gentlest of all wild creatures, that was started, but an enor­ <lb/>
            mous boar, the like of which was never seen-a brawny, thick- <lb/>
            hided, filthy brute, with bristles standing upright on his back, <lb/>
            foaming and gnashing his teeth, with eyes that darted fire, and <lb/>
            rushing along like a thunderbolt. The keenest of the hounds <lb/>
            that pressed upon his flanks were ripped up by his tusks, and <lb/>
            flung here and there; then he broke through the toils at the <lb/>
            first charge, and got clear off. We, meanwhile, were terror- <lb/>
            stricken, having been used only to such hunting as was without <lb/>
            danger, and being, besides, without weapons or means of de­ <lb/>
            fence ; so we hid ourselves the best way we could under thick <lb/>
            foliage and behind trees.</p>
          <p>" Thrasyllus now seeing a favourable opportunity for accom­ <lb/>
            plishing his intended treachery, said insidiously to Tlepolemus: <lb/>
            ' Why do we remain stupified with surprise, or even dismayed, <lb/>
            like these low-souled slaves, and trembling like women, whilst <lb/>
            we suffer such a fine prey to escape us ? Why not mount and <lb/>
            pursue ? You take a javelin, and I will take a lance.'</p>
          <p>" Without more said, they jumped at once on their horses, <lb/>
            and made after the brute with all speed. But the boar, conn- <lb/>
            dent in its strength, wheeled round, and looking horribly fero­ <lb/>
            cious as it gnashed its teeth, stood glaring at them uncertain <lb/>
            which to attack first. Tlepolemus hurled his javelin, and <lb/>
            lodged it in the animal's back; but Thrasyllus, leaving the boar <lb/>
            alone, charged the horse Tlepolemus rode with his lance, and <lb/>
             <pb n="152"/>
            cut its hamstrings. The quadruped, sinking down in a poo* <lb/>
            of its own blood, rolled over on its back, and involuntarily <lb/>
            threw its master, whom the boar immediately rushed at in <lb/>
            fury, and after tearing his clothes, rent his body in many <lb/>
            places as he was endeavouring to rise. Meanwhile, his good <lb/>
            friend felt no remorse for the infamous deed he had begun, nor <lb/>
            was his cruelty yet satisfied; for whilst Tlepolemus was striv­ <lb/>
            ing to defend his gored legs, and was piteously calling to him <lb/>
            for help, he pierced him through the middle of the right thigh <lb/>
            with his lance; which he did the more boldly, because he <lb/>
            judged that the wound would resemble those made by the brute's <lb/>
            tusks. Afterwards he ran the boar through and through with­ <lb/>
            out difficulty.</p>
          <p>" After the young man was thus slain, we were all called <lb/>
            out from our hiding-places, and ran to him in great grief. But <lb/>
            Thrasyllus, though he had accomplished his purpose, and re­ <lb/>
            joiced in having slain him whom he looked on as his enemy, <lb/>
            yet concealed his joy under a countenance that simulated <lb/>
            sorrow; and ardently embracing the corpse that he himself had <lb/>
            made, he cleverly counterfeited all the signs of mourning, only <lb/>
            his tears refused to flow. Thus imitating us who lamented <lb/>
            truly, he falsely cast upon the boar the odium of the deed his <lb/>
            own hand had done.</p>
          <p>"The news of this crime spread quickly, and first of all <lb/>
            reached the family of Tlepolemus, and smote the ears of his <lb/>
            unhappy wife. The moment she heard it—she will never hear <lb/>
            news more-she lost her senses, and ran like a frantic bacchanal <lb/>
            through the crowded streets, and away over the fields, scream­ <lb/>
            ing out her husband's name, and bewailing his fate. The com­ <lb/>
            passionate citizens flocked after her; all who met her followed <lb/>
            Jier, sympathizing in her grief; and the whole city was emptied <lb/>
            to see the sad spectacle. At last, she reached the spot where <lb/>
            lay the body of her husband; there, swooning away, she fell <lb/>
            prostrate on his corpse, and all but yielded up on the spot the <lb/>
            soul that was devoted to him; but her friends with difficulty <lb/>
            forced her away, and she remained unwillingly alive.</p>
          <p>"At last, the body was carried to the tomb, the whole city <lb/>
            joining in the funeral procession. Then did Thrasyllus cry, <lb/>
            and roar, and beat his breast, and even weep, for the tears <lb/>
            which lie had been unable to shed in his first feigned sorrow, <lb/>
            were now supplied him by his augmented joy. He concealed <pb n="153"/>
            <note type="margin"> BOOK VIII. </note> <lb/>
            his real feelings with all sorts of affectionate words, calling <lb/>
            piteously to the deceased by name, as his friend, his playmate <lb/>
            in boyhood, his comrade, his brother. And every now and <lb/>
            then he would take hold of Charite's hands to hinder her from <lb/>
            beating her bosom; would try to mitigate her grief and wail­ <lb/>
            ing with words expressive of the liveliest sympathy, and with <lb/>
            various examples of the uncertainty of life. And amidst all <lb/>
            these false shows of humanity and friendship, he took every <lb/>
            opportunity of touching the person of the bereaved woman, <lb/>
            and nourishing his own odious passion by that stolen pleasure.</p>
          <p>" The funeral being ended, the widow was now impatient to <lb/>
            join her husband, and thought over all means to that end. <lb/>
            At last, she chose one that was gentle, cost no effort, needed <lb/>
            no weapon, and was like quietly falling asleep. She abstained <lb/>
            from food, neglected her person, and would have passed away <lb/>
            from daylight to the darkness of the grave, but for the urgent <lb/>
            pertinacity of Thrasyllus, who, partly by his own efforts, <lb/>
            partly through those of her friends and her parents, prevailed <lb/>
            on her to refresh her disfigured and almost perishing body with <lb/>
            the bath and with food.</p>
          <p>" Charite, who revered her parents, yielded against her will <lb/>
            to a religious sense of duty, and with a somewhat more serene <lb/>
            countenance did what was necessary for the preservation of her <lb/>
            life; but still her inmost soul was consumed with grief. She <lb/>
            spent all her days and nights in pining remembrance, and in <lb/>
            paying divine honours to an image of the deceased, which she <lb/>
            had caused to be made in the costume of the god Bacchus, so <lb/>
            that she tortured herself, even by that kind of consolation. <lb/>
            Meanwhile, the reckless, headlong Thrasyllus, without waiting <lb/>
            until the tears she shed had satisfied her grief, nor till the <lb/>
            commotion of her spirits had partly subsided, and time had <lb/>
            gradually blunted the keenness of her sorrow, did not forbear <lb/>
            to speak to her of marriage while she was still weeping for her <lb/>
            husband, rending her garments, and tearing her hair, and to <lb/>
            reveal to her by his indecent importunity the secret of his <lb/>
            breast and his ineffable treachery.</p>
          <p>" Charite was seized with horror and loathing at the abo­ <lb/>
            minable proposal, which came upon her like a clap of thunder, <lb/>
            or a blast from some malignant star, and she fell senseless as <lb/>
            if smitten by lightning. Recovering after a while, with wild <lb/>
            shrieks, she called to mind what had passed between her and <lb/>
             <pb n="154"/>
            the villain Thrasyllus, and postponed her reply to his suit until <lb/>
            she should have maturely considered it.</p>
          <p>"During that delay, the shade of the cruelly-slam Tlepo­ <lb/>
            lemus, lifting up its ghastly, gory face, thus addressed her as <lb/>
            she slept: ' My own wife, a name which none else shall call <lb/>
            you, if my memory dwells in your heart-if my cruel death <lb/>
            has broken the bonds of affection that united us, contract a <lb/>
            happier marriage with whom you will, only give yourself not <lb/>
            into the sacrilegious hands of Thrasyllus: neither talk with <lb/>
            him, nor sit at the same board, nor share the same bed with <lb/>
            him. Shun the blood-stained hand of my murderer; begin <lb/>
            not your marriage with parricide.* Those gory wounds which <lb/>
            you have washed with your tears were not all inflicted by the <lb/>
            tusks of the boar; but the lance of the wicked Thrasyllus has <lb/>
            parted me from you.' And then he told her all the circum­ <lb/>
            stances, and set before her the whole scene of the crime.</p>
          <p>" When Charite had first laid her head upon her pillow, her <lb/>
            tears flowed over her beautiful cheeks even while she slept; <lb/>
            but roused by the vision of her restless sleep as by the wrench <lb/>
            of the rack, she broke out again into loud and long wailing, <lb/>
            tore her night-dress, and beat her lovely arms with merciless <lb/>
            hands. Yet she imparted to no one the story of the appari­ <lb/>
            tion she had seen; but concealing altogether the knowledge <lb/>
            she had obtained of the crime, she secretly resolved to punish <lb/>
            the nefarious murderer, and to deliver herself from the intoler­ <lb/>
            able burthen of life.</p>
          <p>"Again the odious and importunate suitor assailed her obdu­ <lb/>
            rate ears with proposals of marriage; but she gently declined <lb/>
            them, and dissembling her purpose with admirable artifice, she <lb/>
            thus replied to his urgent supplications : ' The sweet face of <lb/>
            your brother, my beloved husband, is still before my eyes; the <lb/>
            cinnamon odour of his ambrosial body is still in my nostrils; <lb/>
            the beautiful Tlepolemus still lives in my bosom. You will do <lb/>
            best then if you allow a most wretched woman the necessary <lb/>
            time for mourning, and let the remaining months of the year <lb/>
            be spent in that legitimate duty. What I ask concerns not <lb/>
            only my own reputation, but your safety also, lest by a prema­ <lb/>
            ture marriage we provoke the just indignation of my husband's <lb/>
            ghost to your destruction ' <note type="footnote"> was a sort of parricide, <lb/>
            and <lb/>
            * With parricide.]—The murdered his crime of Thrasyllus Chante would have been in a <lb/>
            since he had friend; <lb/>

            </p>
          <p><note type="margin">BOOK vIi. </note> "Unchecked in his importunity by these arguments, and even <lb/>
            by the promise that accompanied them, Thrasyllus persisted <lb/>
            in molesting her ears with his vile addresses, until, apparently <lb/>
            overcome, Charite said to him: ' One thing at least, Thra­ <lb/>
            syllus, you must grant to my earnest entreaties, and that is <lb/>
            that our cohabitation be quite secret and unknown to any of my <lb/>
            family until the year is out.' Thrasyllus was completely duped <lb/>
            by her feigned compliance with his suit; he consented with <lb/>
            'alacrity to the clandestine intercourse, and passionately longed <lb/>
            for the return of night and darkness, caring for nothing in <lb/>
            comparison with the possession of Charite. ' But mind,' <lb/>
            said Charite, ' come well muffled up, without any attendant,- <lb/>
            and approach my door in silence at the first watch. Only <lb/>
            whistle once, and wait for my nurse, who will be on the <lb/>
            watch behind the door, and will instantly open it for you, and <lb/>
            conduct you in the dark to my chamber.'</p>
          <p>" Thrasyllus, suspecting nothing, was delighted with the <lb/>
            scheme of those funereal nuptials, and was only troubled with <lb/>
            impatience at the length of the day and the slow approach of <lb/>
            evening. At last, when daylight had disappeared, dressed as <lb/>
            Charite had directed, he was admitted by the watchful nurse, <lb/>
            and stole full of hope to the nuptial chamber. There the old <lb/>
            woman, treating him with obsequious attention by her mis­ <lb/>
            tress's orders, noiselessly produced cups and a flagon con­ <lb/>
            taining wine mixed with a soporiferous drug. Then excusing <lb/>
            her mistress's delay on the pretext that she was with her father, <lb/>
            who was ill, she plied him with the beverage, which he drank <lb/>
            freely, and without suspicion, until he fell fast asleep.</p>
          <p>" As soon as he lay stretched on his back in that helpless <lb/>
            state, Charite was summoned, and rushing in with dire deter­ <lb/>
            mination, stood quivering with rage over the murderer, ' Be­ <lb/>
            hold,' she cried, ' this faithful companion of my husband! <lb/>
            Behold this gallant hunter! Behold this dear bride-room! <lb/>
            This is the hand that shed my blood; this is the breast that <lb/>
            conceived treacherous plots for my undoing : those are the <lb/>
            eyes that to my sorrow I delighted, but that now anticipate <lb/>
            their coming punishment, wrapped in the darkness that will <lb/>
            cover them perpetually. Sleep securely; dream of delight; <lb/>
            I will not smite you with sword or spear. Far be it from <lb/>
            me to put you on an equality with my husband in the manner <lb/>
            of your death. Your eyes shall die in your living head, and <lb/>
             <pb n="156"/>
            you shall never see more but in dreams. I will make you <lb/>
            think your enemy's death happier than your own life. Never <lb/>
            shall you see the light; you shall need to be led by the hand; <lb/>
            you shall not clasp Charite; you shall not enjoy your pro­ <lb/>
            mised nuptials; you shall know neither the repose of death <lb/>
            nor the pleasure of life ; but you shall wander like an erring <lb/>
            phantom between the infernal regions and the sun; and you <lb/>
            shall long seek the hand that has blinded you, and, what is <lb/>
            the most miserable thing in calamity, you shall not know <lb/>
            whom to complain of. I will make a libation of the blood of <lb/>
            your eyes at the tomb of my Tlepolemus, and sacrifice those <lb/>
            eyes to his sacred shade. But why do I suffer you to have <lb/>
            a respite from your deserved torture, while you are dreaming <lb/>
            perhaps of embracing me, who am your bane ? Wake from <lb/>
            the darkness of sleep to a worse darkness; lift up your sightless <lb/>
            face; recognize my vengeance; comprehend your misfortune; <lb/>
            compute the sum of your miseries. Thus have your eyes <lb/>
            charmed your modest bride; thus have the nuptial torches <lb/>
            lighted your chamber; you shall have the Furies for brides­ <lb/>
            maids, and blindness and the perpetual stings of conscience for <lb/>
            companions.'</p>
          <p>" Having poured out these words like one inspired, Charite <lb/>
            drew out the pin from her hair, and plunged it over and ovei <lb/>
            again into the eyes of Thrasyllus; then leaving him to awake <lb/>
            in pain and blindness from his lethargic sleep, she caught up <lb/>
            the naked sword which Tlepolemus used to wear, and rushed <lb/>
            frantically through the city towards her husband's tomb, mani­ <lb/>
            festly bent on some desperate deed. All of us, servants, and <lb/>
            the whole population, anxiously pursued her, crying out to <lb/>
            each other to wrest the weapon from her insane hands. But <lb/>
            Charite standing by the coffin of Tlepolemus, kept everybody <lb/>
            off with the glittering blade ; and when all around her were <lb/>
            weeping and lamenting, she cried: ' Away with these impor­ <lb/>
            tunate tears! Away with this wailing, which ill accords <lb/>
            with my fortitude. I have taken vengeance upon the bloody <lb/>
            murderer of my husband. I have punished the accursed de. <lb/>
            stroyer of my nuptials; it is now time that with this sword l <lb/>
            make my way straight to my Tlepolemus.'</p>
          <p>" Then having related all that her husband had told her in <lb/>
            the dream, and the artifice by which she had inveigled Thra­ <lb/>
            syllus, she plunged the sword beneath her right breast, fell <pb n="157"/>
            <note type="margin"> LOOK VIII. </note> <lb/>
            bathed in blood, murmured a few broken' words, and breathed <lb/>
            out her magnanimous spirit. The friends of the unfortunate <lb/>
            Charite immediately washed her body with care, and depositing <lb/>
            it by the side of Tlepolemus, re-united her for ever to the <lb/>
            husband she loved.</p>
          <p>" When Thrasyllus was aware of all this, he thought he could <lb/>
            not inflict on himself a death commensurate with the cala­ <lb/>
            mities he had caused, and that the sword could not suffice to <lb/>
            expiate his guilt; therefore he had himself carried to the tomb <lb/>
            of Tlepolemus and Charite, where, crying out repeatedly, ' Be­ <lb/>
            hold, 0 ye injured manes, here is your voluntary victim,' he <lb/>
            caused the doors to be firmly closed upon him; and there he <lb/>
            suffered the doom pronounced by himself, and perished by <lb/>
            starvation."</p>
          <p>END OF THE SEVENTH EPISODE.</p>
          <p>Such was the story, interrupted with many sighs and tears, <lb/>
            which the servant told to the sorrowing rustics, who fearing a <lb/>
            change of master, and deeply commiserating the misfortune of <lb/>
            the house to which they had belonged, determined to run away. <lb/>
            The master of the stud, the same to whom I had been given <lb/>
            in charge with such impressive orders to be kind to me, plun­ <lb/>
            dered the cottage of everything valuable in it, and loading me <lb/>
            and other beasts of burden with the spoil, deserted his old <lb/>
            abode. We carried women and children, cocks and hens, <lb/>
            geese, kids, whelps ; in short, whatever was unable to keep up <lb/>
            with our pace, was made to walk with our feet. But enormous <lb/>
            as my load was, I did not care for it, so glad was I of the <lb/>
            flight that saved me from the knife of that abominable -elder.</p>
          <p>Having crossed a steep mountain covered with a forest, and <lb/>
            descended to the plain on the other side, we arrived, just as <lb/>
            evening was throwing its shadows on our road, at a certain <lb/>
            populous and thriving town, whence the inhabitants would not <lb/>
            allow us to proceed by night, nor even in the morning. The <lb/>
            reason of this was, that the whole district was infested by mul­ <lb/>
            titudes of fierce wolves of enormous bulk and strength, that <lb/>
            even beset the roads and fell like highway robbers on those <lb/>
            who travelled by them. Nay, sometimes impelled by the rage <lb/>
            of hunger, they stormed the neighbouring farms, and the men <lb/>
            were no more safe from their fury than their defenceless flocks. <lb/>
            They told us too, that the road we should have to travel was <lb/>
            strewn with half-eaten human bodies, and whitened with flesh­ <lb/>
             <pb n="158"/>
            less bones; and therefore, that we ought to proceed with ex­ <lb/>
            treme caution, and be especially careful to travel only in broad <lb/>
            day-light, while the sun was high in the heavens, since its <lb/>
            light checks the fury of those dreadful creatures; 'and that we <lb/>
            should move, not stragglingly, but in close compact order, <lb/>
            through those dangerous places.</p>
          <p>But our rascally fugitive conductors, in blind haste to escape <lb/>
            the risk of pursuit, despised these salutary warnings, and with­ <lb/>
            out waiting for day-light, loaded and drove us forward. Then <lb/>
            I, aware of the danger, took all possible care to keep between <lb/>
            the other beasts in the very middle of the throng, so as to save <lb/>
            my buttocks from the fangs of the wolves; and all our con­ <lb/>
            ductors were much surprised to see me beat the horses in speed. <lb/>
            But this was not the result of my natural quickness of limb, <lb/>
            but of my fear; and I thought within myself that it was <lb/>
            nothing else than fright which had given such agility to the <lb/>
            renowned Pegasus, and that the reason why he had been styled <lb/>
            winged, was, doubtless, because he had skipped and bounded up <lb/>
            to the very sky, in his dread of being bitten by the fire-breath­ <lb/>
            ing Chimæra.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile the herdsmen who drove us had armed themselves <lb/>
            as if for battle. This one carried a lance, that one a hunting <lb/>
            spear, another a bundle of javelins, another a club ; and some <lb/>
            had provided themselves with stones, which the rough road <lb/>
            supplied in abundance. A few carried sharpened stakes, and <lb/>
            a great number waved blazing torches to frighten the beasts; <lb/>
            and nothing but the trumpet was wanting to give our troop <lb/>
            the appearance of an army in battle array. But after having <lb/>
            terribly frightened ourselves, we escaped the threatened danger <lb/>
            only to fall into a worse one. For, whether scared by the <lb/>
            shouting of solargeabody of men, and by the glare of the torches, <lb/>
            or being engaged elsewhere, the wolves never approached us, <lb/>
            nor did one of them come in sight even at a distance. But <lb/>
            the labourers on the farm which we were then passing, taking <lb/>
            us for a gang of robbers, and letting slip enormous dogs, which <lb/>
            had been carefully trained for their masters' defence, and were <lb/>
            fiercer than any wolves or bears, urged them against us with <lb/>
            all sorts of shouts and cries. With their natural ferocity <lb/>
            thus encouraged and exasperated, the dogs rushed at us, at­ <lb/>
            tacked ns on all sides, men and cattle w ithout distinction, and <lb/>
            after mauling them a long time, laid many of them low. It <pb n="159"/>
            <note type="margin"> BOOK VIII. </note> <lb/>
            was certainly a remarkable, and still more a pitiable spectacle, <lb/>
            to see all those dogs seizing those that. fled, ravening at those <lb/>
            who stood their ground, mounting upon the bodies of those <lb/>
            who were down, and overrunning our whole troop, biting all <lb/>
            that came before them.</p>
          <p>This was terrible indeed, but worse was added to it; for the <lb/>
            peasants poured down showers of stones upon us from the <lb/>
            roofs of their cottages and from an adjacent hill, so that we <lb/>
            were quite at a loss to know which we should most avoid, the <lb/>
            dogs that attacked us at close quarters, or the stones that were <lb/>
            launched at us from a distance. One of the latter fell upon <lb/>
            the head of a woman who was seated on my back, and who, <lb/>
            smarting from the blow, immediately began to scream and roar <lb/>
            for her husband to come to her aid. Wiping the blood from <lb/>
            her wound, the herdsman cried out, " In the name of all the <lb/>
            gods, why do you so cruelly assault and maltreat poor hard­ <lb/>
            working travellers ? Have we offered to rob you ? What harm <lb/>
            have we ever done you ? You do not live in dens like wild <lb/>
            beasts, or in caves like savages, that you should take delight <lb/>
            in shedding human blood."</p>
          <p>As soon as he had said this, the shower of stones ceased, <lb/>
            the ferocious dogs were called off, and one of the peasants <lb/>
            cried out from the top of a cypress tree- on which he was <lb/>
            perched: "And we too, are no robbers, and do not want to <lb/>
            plunder you; we only fight to protect ourselves from suffering <lb/>
            the like at your hands, so now you may go your ways in peace <lb/>
            and safety." Therefore we continued our journey, but wounded <lb/>
            in all manner of ways, some with stones, others by the teeth <lb/>
            of the dogs, but all more or less hurt.</p>
          <p>Having gone a little way further, we reached a grove of tall <lb/>
            trees, with pleasant green glades, where our leaders thought <lb/>
            good to rest and take some refreshment, and dress the wounds <lb/>
            of their bruised and mangled bodies. So they threw them­ <lb/>
            selves on the ground in all directions, and after lying awhile <lb/>
            to recover from their fatigue, they began to apply various re­ <lb/>
            medies to their wounds, washing the blood from them in the <lb/>
            running stream ; applying wet sponges to their contusions, and <lb/>
            tying up their gaping wounds with bandages. In this way each <lb/>
            did the best he could for himself. Meanwhile, an old man was <lb/>
            descried on the top of a hill, with goats feeding round him, and <lb/>
            plainly showing that he was a goat-herd. One of our people <lb/>
             <pb n="160"/>
            called out, and asked him had he any milk or new cheese to <lb/>
            sell. But he, shaking his head a long while, replied : "And <lb/>
            are you thinking of food or drink, or of any refreshment at all ? <lb/>
            Do you not know what sort of a place you are in ?" So saying, <lb/>
            he turned his back upon us, and went off with his flock.</p>
          <p>His words, and the manner of his departure, struck our <lb/>
            people with no small fear; and while they were all anxious <lb/>
            to ascertain the nature of the spot where they lay, but could <lb/>
            find no one to tell them, another old man made his appearance. <lb/>
            He was a tall man, bent with age, and dragged his feet slowly <lb/>
            and wearily along, leaning heavily on his staff, and weeping <lb/>
            profusely. When he came up with our men, he threw himself <lb/>
            on his knees before them, and embracing them one after the <lb/>
            other, thus besought in most piteous accents: " By your for­ <lb/>
            tunes, by your genii,* and as you hope to live strong and <lb/>
            hearty till you reach my age, help an unfortunate old man, <lb/>
            who has lost his only hope, and save my little boy from the <lb/>
            jaws of death. My grandson, the sweet companion of my <lb/>
            journey, tried to catch a sparrow chirping on a hedge, and he <lb/>
            fell into a ditch close by here, that was hidden with low shrubs, <lb/>
            and there he lies in extreme peril of his life. I know indeed, <lb/>
            by his cries to me for help, that he is still alive. But being so <lb/>
            weak in body, as you see, I cannot succour him. But you, who <lb/>
            enjoy youth and strength, can easily aid an unhappy old man, <lb/>
            and save for him this'child, the last and only scion of my stock."</p>
          <p>As the old man made these entreaties and tore his white <lb/>
            hair, we were all moved with pity; and one of the party, the <lb/>
            youngest, boldest and strongest of them all, who besides, was <lb/>
            the only one that had come off unwounded from the late con­ <lb/>
            flict, sprang to his feet, and enquiring where it was the boy <lb/>
            had fallen, went with the old man towards some rough bushes <lb/>
            which the latter pointed out a little way off. Meanwhile, <lb/>
            after the cattle had done feeding, and their drivers had finished <lb/>
            their meal and the dressing of their wounds, each of them <lb/>
            packed up his baggage again, and. made ready for another start. <lb/>
            They called loudly to the young man who had gone away with <lb/>
            the old stranger, and afterwards, surprised by his long delay, <lb/>
            they sent one of their number to look for him, and tell him it <note type="footnote"> * Your genii.]—The Romans believed that to every human being be­ <lb/>
            longed a special protecting deity, who lived and died with his protégé, as <lb/>
            the hamadryad did with her oak. These personal gods were called the <lb/>
            Genius, or the Juno, according as they belonged to a man or a woman. </note> <pb n="161"/>

            was time to be off. The messenger came back soon, trembling, <lb/>
            and ghastly pale, and brought strange news of his fellow-ser­ <lb/>
            vant. He had seen him, he said, lying on his back, half eaten, <lb/>
            and a monstrous dragon squatting over him; whilst the un­ <lb/>
            fortunate old man was not to be seen at all.</p>
          <p>Considering this matter, and comparing it with the words <lb/>
            of the shepherd on the hill, which had doubtless been intended <lb/>
            to warn them against that terrible inhabitant of the neighbour­ <lb/>
            hood, our men hurried away as fast as they could from the <lb/>
            deadly spot, drubbing us briskly with their sticks. After <lb/>
            getting over a long stage at a very quick rate, we arrived at a <lb/>
            village where we halted for the night, and there I learned a <lb/>
            very extraordinary occurrence which I will relate.</p>

            <title type="sub">SINGULAR PUNISHMENT OF A CRIMINAL.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>THERE was a servant to whom his master had committed the <lb/>
            management of all his affairs, and who was bailiff of that large <lb/>
            farm where we had taken up our quarters. He had married <lb/>
            one of his fellow-servants, but fell in love with a free woman <lb/>
            who was not of the household. Enraged by his adultery, his <lb/>
            wife burned all his account books, and all the contents of his <lb/>
            store-room. And not content with having thus avenged the <lb/>
            wrongs of her bed, but turning her fury against her own flesh <lb/>
            and blood, she put a rope round her neck, fastened to it also an <lb/>
            infant she had borne to her husband, and threw herself into a <lb/>
            deep well along with her little one. Her master was exceed­ <lb/>
            ingly incensed at her loss, and seizing the servant who had pro­ <lb/>
            voked his own wife to the commission of such a dreadful deed, <lb/>
            had him stripped naked, smeared all over with honey, and bound <lb/>
            fast to a fig-tree, the rotten trunk of which was filled with the <lb/>
            nests of a prodigious multitude of ants, that were continually <lb/>
            running to and from all directions. As soon as these ants smelt <lb/>
            the honey with which the bailiffs body was smeared, they <lb/>
            fastened upon him, and with minute, but innumerable and in­ <lb/>
            cessant bites, gradually consumed his flesh and his entrails; <lb/>
            and after the miserable man had been thus tortured a long <lb/>
            while, his bones were at last picked clean; and so they were <lb/>
            still to be seen, quite dry and white, attached to the fatal tree.</p>

            </p>
          <p>Quitting this detestable dwelling, and leaving the rustics in <lb/>
            great sorrow, we proceeded on our journey. After travelling <lb/>
            all day over a level country, we came much fatigued to a hand­ <lb/>
            some populous town. There our men resolved to stop and <lb/>
            take up their permanent abode, both because the place offered <lb/>
            them every convenience for hiding from those who might come <lb/>
            from a distance in pursuit of them, and because the town was <lb/>
            abundantly blessed with provisions. Myself and the other <lb/>
            beasts were allowed three days' rest to improve our condition, <lb/>
            and then we were led out for sale. The crier proclaimed the <lb/>
            price of each of us with a loud voice, and all were bought by <lb/>
            wealthy persons, except myself, whom all the purchasers passed <lb/>
            by with contempt. I lost patience at the manner in which I <lb/>
            was handled, and my teeth examined to ascertain my age; <lb/>
            there was one man especially, who was always poking his nasty <lb/>
            dirty fingers against my gums; but at last, I caught his hand <lb/>
            between my teeth, and nearly crushed it. That deterred every <lb/>
            one from buying me, as a ferociously vicious brute. Then the <lb/>
            crier, bawling till his throat was almost split, cracked all sorts <lb/>
            of ridiculous jokes upon me. " What is the use," said he, “of <lb/>
            offering for sale this old screw of a jackass, with his foundered <lb/>
            hoofs, his ugly colour, his sluggishness in everything but vice, <lb/>
            and a hide that is nothing but a ready-made sieve ? Let us <lb/>
            even make a present of him, if we can find any one who will <lb/>
            not be loth to throw away hay upon the brute." In this way <lb/>
            the crier kept the byestanders in roars of laughter.</p>
          <p>But my merciless fortune, which I had been unable to leave <lb/>
            behind me, far as I had fled, or to appease by all my past suf­ <lb/>
            ferings, again cast its evil eye upon me, and for a wonder, pro­ <lb/>
            duced a purchaser, the fittest of all men to prolong my hard <lb/>
            sufferings. He was an old eunuch, partly bald, with what <lb/>
            grizzled hair he had left hanging in long curls, one of those <lb/>
            lowest dregs of the rabble who compel the Syrian goddess <lb/>
            to beg, hawking her about the highways and the towns, <lb/>
            and playing on cymbals and castanets. This man having a <lb/>
            great mind to buy me, asked the crier of what country I was. <lb/>
            The latter replied that I was Cappadocian,* and a fine strong <note type="footnote"> * Cappadocian.]—Part of the crier's fun consists in talking of the ass as <lb/>
            if he was a human slave. Hence his mention of Cappadocia, which had <lb/>
            no particular reputation for its breed of asses, but which surpassed all the <lb/>
            other provinces of the empire in the number and value of the slaves it <lb/>
            supplied to Rome. </note> <pb n="163"/>
            <note type="margin"> BOOK VIII. </note> <lb/>
            animal. Again, the other asked my age. “The mathema­ <lb/>
            tician who cast his nativity," replied the joking crier, " cal­ <lb/>
            culated that he was fire years old; but no doubt he is better <lb/>
            informed on this point than any one else, from the register of <lb/>
            his birth. Now though I make myself liable to the penalties of <lb/>
            the Cornelian law if I knowingly sell you a Roman citizen for <lb/>
            a slave, what should hinder you from buying a good and useful <lb/>
            servant, who will do your pleasure at home and abroad?"</p>
          <p>The odious purchaser went on asking questions without end, <lb/>
            and at last came to the important point, was I gentle ? " Gen­ <lb/>
            tle?" said the crier; "it is not an ass, but a wether you see <lb/>
            before you, such a quiet thing you may do what you will with <lb/>
            himj none of your biters or kickers; but altogether such an <lb/>
            animal that you might suppose there was a decent, honest man <lb/>
            under his ass's hide. You may convince yourself of the fact <lb/>
            without difficulty; only stick your face between his thighs, and <lb/>
            you will see how patient he will be."</p>
          <p>Thus did the crier make fun of the old vagabond; but the <lb/>
            latter perceived that the other was mocking, and cried out in <lb/>
            a passion: “What, you deaf and dumb carcase, you crazy <lb/>
            crier, may the omnipotent and all-procreant Syrian goddess, <lb/>
            and blessed Sabazius, and Bellona, and the Idœan mother, and <lb/>
            our mistress Venus, with her Adonis, strike you blind, you <lb/>
            that have been flinging your scurrilous jokes at me this evei <lb/>
            so long. Do you think me such a fool as to put the goddesf <lb/>
            on the back of a vicious brute, that he might pitch the divine <lb/>
            image to the ground, and that I should have to run about with <lb/>
            my hair streaming, to look for some one to lift my goddess <lb/>
            from the ground, and repair her hurts ?"</p>
          <p>When I heard him talk in this strain, I thought of prancing <lb/>
            suddenly, like mad, that seeing how very wild I was, he <lb/>
            might give up the thought of buying me. But the anxious <lb/>
            purchaser anticipated my intention by at once paying down <lb/>
            the price, seventeen denars, which my master promptly took <lb/>
            up, to his own satisfaction and my vexation, and immediately <lb/>
            delivered me to my new owner, Philebus, with a rush halter <lb/>
            round my neck. Philebus took me home with him, and cried <lb/>
            out the moment he reached the door: " Hallo, girls! here is a <lb/>
            handsome servant I have bought for you." Now these girls <lb/>
            were a set of eunuchs, who immediately broke out into screams <lb/>
            of joy, with broken, hoarse, effeminate voices, thinking it was <note type="footnote"> h 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="164"/>
            a slave fit to render them good service. But when they per­ <lb/>
            ceived the substitution, not of a stag for a virgin,* but of a <lb/>
            jackass for a man, they turned up their noses, and jeered at <lb/>
            their leader, saying he had not brought a servant for them, <lb/>
            but a husband for himself. " Mind," said they, " you don't <lb/>
            keep this pretty dear all to yourself, but let us too, your doves, <lb/>
            have the use of him sometimes." Thus babbling, they took <lb/>
            and tied me to the manger.</p>
          <p>There was among them a strapping young fellow, who played <lb/>
            extremely well on the horn, and whom they had bought at <lb/>
            the slave mart, with the money they had collected here and <lb/>
            there. Abroad he used to play before them when they led the <lb/>
            goddess in procession, and at home they employed him in other <lb/>
            ways. As soon as he witnessed my arrival, he was greatly <lb/>
            delighted, and gave me plenty of fodder, joyfully exclaiming: <lb/>
            " You are come at last to relieve me in my terrible labours ; <lb/>
            long may you live, and be a pleasure to your masters, and give <lb/>
            me a chance to recruit my exhausted strength.” Hearing him <lb/>
            talk thus, I pondered on the new troubles that were before me.</p>
          <p>Next day they went out, all dressed in various colours, <lb/>
            hideously bedizened, their faces and eyelids daubed with paint, <lb/>
            with small mitres on their heads, and wearing saffron-coloured <lb/>
            linen and silk vestments. Some of them had white tunics, <lb/>
            covered with narrow purple stripes in all directions; and they <lb/>
            all wore girdles and yellow shoes. They laid the goddess, <lb/>
            covered with a silk mantle, on my back; and brandishing <lb/>
            enormous swords and axes, with their arms bared to the shoul­ <lb/>
            der, they danced and bounded like maniacs to the sound of the <lb/>
            flute. After going about a good many cottages, they came to <lb/>
            a rich man's villa, and setting up their yells at the very gate, <lb/>
            they rushed frantically in. Bending down their heads, they <lb/>
            rolled their necks about, making their long hair stand out in a <lb/>
            circle; from time to time they bit their flesh with their teeth, <lb/>
            and lastly, they cut their arms with the sharp weapon which <lb/>
            each of them carried. There was one of them who was trans­ <lb/>
            ported with a more ecstatic fury than the rest, and heaving his <lb/>
            breath rapidly from the bottom of his chest, as if filled with <lb/>
            the divine spirit, he pretended to be stark mad; as if the pre­ <lb/>
            sence of the gods did not do men good, but weakened or disor­ <lb/>
            dered them. But you shall see how by divine providence tney <note type="footnote"> * The substitution, not of a stag for a virgin.]—As happened when <lb/>
            Iphigenia, the daughter of Agamemnon, was about to be sacrificed at Aulis. </note> <pb n="165"/>
            <note type="margin"> BOOK vIlI. </note> <lb/>
            received their due reward. The fellow began by delivering a <lb/>
            trumped-up story of his own guilt, and crying out aloud, in <lb/>
            the tone of a prophet, that he had committed some offence <lb/>
            against the holy laws of religion; and then he called upon his <lb/>
            hands to inflict on. him the chastisement due to his crime. At <lb/>
            the same time he took up one of the whips usually carried by <lb/>
            those half men, with several long lashes of twisted wool, strung <lb/>
            with knuckle-bones of sheep, and gave himself a severe flog­ <lb/>
            ging, the pain of which he endured with astonishing firmness. <lb/>
            You might see the ground wet with the blood that flowed from <lb/>
            the gashes of the sword and the strokes of the whip. Now <lb/>
            the sight of all this blood and wounds caused me no slight <lb/>
            uneasiness, lest perchance the stomach of the foreign goddess <lb/>
            might crave for ass's blood, as some men's for ass's milk.</p>
          <p>When at last they were tired, or thought they had scarified <lb/>
            themselves sufficiently, they left off their butchery. Then the <lb/>
            byestanders vied with each other in dropping money, not only <lb/>
            brass, but silver too, into the open bosom of their robes. They <lb/>
            received, besides, a barrel of wine, milk, cheese, barley, and <lb/>
            wheaten meal, besides barley for myself, the bearer of the god­ <lb/>
            dess. All these things they stuffed into bags provided for the <lb/>
            receipt of such doles, and laid them on my back; so that being <lb/>
            doubly laden, I was at once a walking temple and a walking <lb/>
            granary. Roaming about in that manner, they plundered the <lb/>
            whole region.</p>
          <p>One day, being highly pleased with an unusually large col­ <lb/>
            lection they made in a certain town, they resolved to regale <lb/>
            themselves and be merry. They begged a very fat ram from <lb/>
            a farmer, whom they cajoled with a lying prophecy, and told <lb/>
            him they would sacrifice it to appease the hunger of the Syrian <lb/>
            goddess. Having made all their preparations for the banquet, <lb/>
            they went to the baths, and on their return they brought a <lb/>
            remarkably vigorous peasant home with them to supper. They <lb/>
            had only tasted a few morsels of the first course, when they <lb/>
            started up from table, and gathering round the young man, <lb/>
            began to assail him with execrable solicitations.</p>
          <p>Unable to endure the abominable spectacle, I tried to shout. <lb/>
            0 CITIZENS ! but could not get beyond the 0, which I uttered <lb/>
            in a fine sonorous tone, well becoming a jackass, but very un­ <lb/>
            luckily timed. For several young men, who were looking for <lb/>
            an ass that had been stolen the night before, and who were <lb/>
            closely examining all the inns to see if the animal was not in <lb/>
             <pb n="166"/>
            one of them, happening to hear me bray, and thinking it might <lb/>
            be their own ass that was hidden in the house, rushed in un­ <lb/>
            expectedly, and caught these miscreants in the very midst of <lb/>
            their detestable turpitudes. Instantly calling in the neigh­ <lb/>
            bours from all quarters, they made them aware of the horrible <lb/>
            discovery, bestowing at the same time sarcastic compliments <lb/>
            on the sanctimonious purity of those priests. Struck with <lb/>
            consternation at this disclosure of their infamy, which spread <lb/>
            rapidly among the people, and made them objects of universal <lb/>
            abhorrence, my masters packed up every thing, and secretly <lb/>
            quitted the town about midnight.</p>
          <p>After getting over a good deal of ground before dawn, and <lb/>
            arrived by daylight in an unfrequented spot, they held a long <lb/>
            consultation, which ended in their proceeding to punish me <lb/>
            unmercifully. They lifted the goddess off my back, and laid <lb/>
            her on the ground, stripped off all my trappings, tied me to <lb/>
            a tree, and flogged me with their whip strung with sheep's <lb/>
            bones until I was all but dead. There was one who proposed <lb/>
            to hamstring me with an axe, because I had so foully scan­ <lb/>
            dalised his modesty; but the others voted for leaving me alone, <lb/>
            not from any good will to me, but in consideration of the image <lb/>
            that lay on the ground.</p>
          <p>They replaced my load therefore on my back, and drove me <lb/>
            before them with blows of the flat of their swords, till we are <lb/>
            rived at a great town. One of its principal inhabitants, a very <lb/>
            religious man, who had a great reverence for the gods, hearing <lb/>
            the tinkling of the cymbals, the beating of the timbrels, and <lb/>
            the soft Phrygian music, came to meet us, and offer his devout <lb/>
            hospitality to the goddess. He lodged us all within his fine <lb/>
            spacious mansion, and sought to win the divine favour by the <lb/>
            most profound veneration and the finest victims</p>
          <p>Here it was that my life was exposed to the greatest danger <lb/>
            I ever remember to have incurred. A certain person in the <lb/>
            country had sent as a present to our host, who was his land­ <lb/>
            lord, the haunch of a very large and fat stag he had killed in <lb/>
            the chase. It had been carelessly hung rather low behind the <lb/>
            kitchen door, where a hound seized it, and carried it off. When <lb/>
            the cook discovered his loss, which he imputed to his own <lb/>
            negligence, his lamentation was extreme, and for a long time <lb/>
            he shed unavailing tears, thinking that his master would pre­ <lb/>
            sently call for hIs supper. Terrified at last at the punishment <pb n="167"/>
            <note type="margin"> BOOK IX. </note> <lb/>
            that awaited him, he tenderly kissed his little son, snatched <lb/>
            up a rope, and set about hanging himself. But his affectionate <lb/>
            wife became opportunely aware of his desperate case, and seizing <lb/>
            the fatal noose in both hands with all her might, “What,” she <lb/>
            cried, "has this accident frightened you. out of your senses? <lb/>
            Do you not see the remedy which the providence of the gods <lb/>
            has offered to your hands ? If you have any sense left in this <lb/>
            whirlwind of disaster, rouse it up and listen to me. Take that <lb/>
            ass, that was brought here to-day, to some out-of-the-way place, <lb/>
            and cut his throat; then take from the carcase a haunch just <lb/>
            like that which is lost, cook it nicely, dress it with the most <lb/>
            savoury sauce you can make, and serve it up before your mas­ <lb/>
            ter, instead of the venison."</p>
          <p>The rascally cook was delighted at the thought of saving his <lb/>
            own life at the cost of mine ; and highly extolling his wife's <lb/>
            sagacity, he set about sharpening his knives, to execute the <lb/>
            butchery she had recommended.</p>

            me. There was no time to be lost; the danger was too urgent <lb/>
            to allow of long cogitation; I resolved to escape by flight from <lb/>
            the knife that was so near my throat, and instantly breaking <lb/>
            the halter with which I was tied, I galloped away as fast as <lb/>
            my legs could carry me, flinging out my heels as I ran for the <lb/>
            greater safety. Having quickly shot across the first portico, I <lb/>
            dashed without hesitation into the dining-room, where the <lb/>
            master of the house was feasting with the priests of the god­ <lb/>
            dess on the sacrificial meats ; and I upset and smashed great <lb/>
            part of the supper things, and even the tables. The master of <lb/>
            the house, greatly annoyed by such unseemly havoc, ordered <lb/>
            one of his servants to take away “the troublesome, frisky <lb/>
            brute," as he called me, and gave the man strict injunctions <lb/>
            to shut me up in some safe place, that I might not again dis­ <lb/>
            turb the quiet of his guests by such pranks. For my part, <lb/>
            having saved myself from the knife by this clever feat, I was <lb/>
            very glad to enjoy the security of my prison.</p>
          <p>But certainly it is not for mortal man to prosper against the <lb/>
            will of fortune, nor can all the contrivances of human wisdom <lb/>
            overthrow or alter the fatal disposition of divine providence.* <lb/>
            That very device of mine, which seemed to have afforded me <lb/>
            a momentary deliverance, brought upon me another peril, <lb/>
            which went near to cause my instant destruction; for one of <lb/>
            the servants, as I afterwards learned from what passed between <lb/>
            his fellows, rushed in great agitation into the supper-room, <lb/>
            and told his master that a mad dog had just before run into <lb/>
            the house through a back door, opening on a lane; that he had <lb/>
            fallen furiously on the hounds; then made for the stables, <lb/>
            where he had wreaked his rage on the horses; and lastly, that <lb/>
            he had not spared the men either, for he had bitten Myrtilus, <lb/>

            providentiœ fatalis dispositio, which the Delphin editors erroneously in­ <lb/>
            terpret, ordo immutabilis providentiœ divinœ. For Providence, according <lb/>
            to the Platonic philosophy, (and Apuleius was a Platonist), is superior to <lb/>
            Fate; and in consequence of this, whatever is produced by Fate is also <lb/>
            produced by Providence ; but not vice versa. Apuleius, therefore, rightly <lb/>
            ascribes thefatal disposition of things to Divine Providence, because this <lb/>
            disposition or order proceeds primarily from Providence, but secondarily <lb/>
            from Fate; but the fatal is not the same with the immutable order of <lb/>
            things: for the latter pertains to Providence alone, but the former to <lb/>
            Providence in conjunction with Fate.—Taylor. </note> <pb n="169"/>

            lain, and Apollonius, the physician, besides a great many other <lb/>
            servants who had endeavoured to drive him out; and some of <lb/>
            the animals he had bitten, already showed undoubted symptoms <lb/>
            of rabidness.</p>
          <p>The whole party was struck with dismay at this intelligence, <lb/>
            and guessing from my wild behaviour, that I was infected <lb/>
            with the same malady, they caught up such weapons as lay at <lb/>
            hand, and exhorted each other to despatch me for their com­ <lb/>
            mon safety, though, in fact, it was they themselves who were <lb/>
            mad, and not I. They would doubtless have cut me to <lb/>
            pieces with the lances, spears, and even axes, with which the <lb/>
            servants readily supplied them, had I not run before the storm, <lb/>
            and burst into the bed-chamber of the priests, my masters. <lb/>
            My pursuers then fastened the door upon me, and kept me be­ <lb/>
            sieged, that the deadly virus might do its work, and destroy <lb/>
            me, without their running the risk of coming in contact with <lb/>
            me. Finding, therefore, that I was left alone and free to do <lb/>
            as I pleased, I profited by the opportunity which fortune <lb/>
            offered me, lay down on a bed, and enjoyed what I had so <lb/>
            long foregone, a good sleep in human fashion.</p>
          <p>Having slept off my fatigue on that good bed, I awoke when <lb/>
            it was already broad daylight, and jumped up fresh and <lb/>
            hearty. Then I heard the people who had kept watch all <lb/>
            night outside the door, thus debating with one another about <lb/>
            me. " Is it likely that this unfortunate ass can go on raging <lb/>
            everlastingly ? Surely not. It is rather to be presumed that <lb/>
            the virus has spent itself, and his fit is over." As their opi­ <lb/>
            nions differed on this question, they agreed to have a look at <lb/>
            me; and peeping through a chink in the door, they saw me <lb/>
            standing at my ease, apparently as quiet and as well as ever. <lb/>
            Thereupon, they ventured to open the door and examine my <lb/>
            state more fully; and one of them, who was sent from heaven <lb/>
            to be my saviour, proposed to the rest a means of knowing <lb/>
            whether I was mad or not. This was to put a vessel full of <lb/>
            fresh water before me; if I drank it without hesitation, in my <lb/>
            usual way, this would be a sure proof that I was quite free <lb/>
            from all distemper; on the contrary, if I shunned the water <lb/>
            with manifest horror at the sight of it, it would be a clear <lb/>
            case that the dreadful malady had still fast hold of me ; for so <lb/>
            it was laid down in ancient books, and confirmed by frequent <lb/>
            experience. <pb n="170"/>
            </p>
          <p>This advice being voted good, they forthwith fetched a large <lb/>
            vessel full of fine clear water from the nearest fountain, and <lb/>
            placed it before me, still keeping on their guard. I went up <lb/>
            to it at once, being very thirsty, and plunging my head into <lb/>
            the vessel, drank up the water, which truly did me much <lb/>
            good in every way. Then I quietly suffered them to pat me <lb/>
            with their hands, rub my ears, lead me by the headstall, and <lb/>
            do whatever else they pleased by way of trying me, until they <lb/>
            were all convinced of my gentleness, and of their own mistake <lb/>
            in supposing me to be mad.</p>
          <p>Having thus preserved myself from two great dangers, I <lb/>
            was again loaded next day with the divine baggage, and <lb/>
            marched away to the sound of cymbals and castanets, to con­ <lb/>
            tinue our mendicant rounds. After visiting a great number of <lb/>
            hamlets and towns, we arrived at a village built on the ruins <lb/>
            of a town that had formerly been very opulent, as the inhab­ <lb/>
            itants reported. We entered the first inn we came to, and <lb/>
            there we heard a pleasant story of the way in which the wife <lb/>
            of a poor man cuckolded her husband: and you shall hear it <lb/>
            too.</p>

            <title type="sub">WHAT THE POOR MAN GOT FOR HIS TUB.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>THERE was a poor man who had nothing to subsist on but his <lb/>
            scanty earnings as a journeyman carpenter. He had a wife <lb/>
            who was also very poor, but notorious for her lasciviousness. <lb/>
            One day, when the man had gone out betimes to his work, an <lb/>
            impudent gallant immediately stepped into his house. But <lb/>
            whilst he and the wife were warmly engaged, and thinking <lb/>
            themselves secure, the husband, who had no suspicion of such <lb/>
            doings, returned quite unexpectedly. The door being locked <lb/>
            and bolted, for which he mentally extolled his well-conducted <lb/>
            wife, he knocked and whistled to announce his presence. Then <lb/>
            his cunning wife, who was quite expert in such matters, released <lb/>
            the man from her close embraces, and hid him quickly in an <lb/>
            old empty butt, that was sunk half-way in the ground, in a <lb/>
            corner of the room. Then she opened the door, and began to <lb/>
            scold her husband the moment he entered. " So you are come <lb/>
            home empty-handed, are you?” said she, "to sit here with <lb/>
            your arms folded, doing nothing, instead of going on with your <pb n="171"/>
            <note type="margin"> BOOK J X. </note> <lb/>
            regular work, to get us a living and buy us a bit of food; while <lb/>
            I, poor soul, must work my fingers out of joint, spinning wool <lb/>
            day and night, to have at least as much as will keep a lamp <lb/>
            burning in our bit of a room. Ah, how much better off is my <lb/>
            neighbour Daphne, that has her fill of meat and drink from <lb/>
            daylight to dark, and enjoys herself with her lovers."</p>
          <p>" What need of all this fuss ?" replied the abused husband; <lb/>
            for though our foreman has given us a holiday, having busi­ <lb/>
            ness of his own in the forum, I have nevertheless provided for <lb/>
            our supper to-night. You see that useless butt, that takes up <lb/>
            so much room, and is only an incumbrance to our little place; <lb/>
            I sold it for five denars to a man who will be here presently <lb/>
            to pay for it and take it away. So lend me a hand for a mo­ <lb/>
            ment, till I get it out to deliver it to the buyer."</p>
          <p>Ready at once with a scheme to fit the occasion, the woman <lb/>
            burst into an insolent laugh : “ Truly I have got a fine fel­ <lb/>
            low for a husband; a capital hand at a bargain, surely, to go <lb/>
            and sell at such a price a thing which I, who am but a woman, <lb/>
            had already sold for seven denars, without even quitting the <lb/>
            house."</p>
          <p>Delighted at' what he heard, “ And who is he," said the <lb/>
            husband, “who has bought it so dear ?”</p>
          <p>“He has been down in the cask ever so long, you booby," <lb/>
            she replied, " examining it all over to see if it is sound."</p>
          <p>The gallant failed not to take his cue from the woman, and <lb/>
            promptly rising up out of the butt, “ Shall I tell you the truth, <lb/>
            good woman?" he said; " your tub is very old, and cracked in <lb/>
            I don't know how many places." Then turning to the hus­ <lb/>
            band, without appearing to know him: " Why don't you <lb/>
            bring me a light, my tight little fellow, whoever you are, that <lb/>
            I may scrape off the dirt from the inside, and see whether or <lb/>
            not the tub is fit for use, unless you think I don't come honestly <lb/>
            by my money ?"</p>
          <p>That pattern of all quick-witted husbands, suspecting no­ <lb/>
            thing, immediately lighted a lamp, and said, " Come out, bro­ <lb/>
            ther, and leave me to make it all right for you." So saying, <lb/>
            he stripped, and taking the lamp with him into the tub, went <lb/>
            to work to scrape off the old hardened dirt. And while he <lb/>
            was polishing the inside, the charming gallant polished off the <lb/>
            carpenter's wife, laying her on her belly on the outside, she <lb/>
            meanwhile amusing herself, like a harlot as she was, with <lb/>
             <pb n="172"/>
            making fan of her husband, poking her head into the tub, and <lb/>
            pointing out this place and that to be cleaned, and then another, <lb/>
            and another; until both jobs being finished, the unfortunate <lb/>
            carpenter received his seven denars, and had to carry the butt <lb/>
            on Iris back to the adulterer's house.</p>
          <p>END OF THE NINTH EPISODE.</p>
          <p>After staying a few days in this town, where they were <lb/>
            pampered by the bounty of the public, and made a great deal <lb/>
            by their soothsaying, these pious priests bethought them of a <lb/>
            new device for getting money. They composed a single <lb/>
            oracular response, which would fit a variety of cases, and thus <lb/>
            they gulled a great number of persons who came to consult <lb/>
            them upon all sorts of subjects. The oracle was as follows: <lb/>
            The steers are yoked, and till the ground, <lb/>
            That crops may rise, and joys abound.*</p>
          <p>Suppose now that a person consulted the oracle with regard <lb/>
            to his marrying: to him it said plainly that he should take <lb/>
            upon him the yoke of matrimony, and raise a fine crop of chil­ <lb/>
            dren. Suppose it was one who had a mind to buy land: the <lb/>
            yoked oxen and the abundant harvests were quite to the point. <lb/>
            If the applicant was anxious about a journey he had to take: <lb/>
            the meekest of quadrupeds were ready yoked, and the produce <lb/>
            of the soil signified a lucrative result. If he was one who had <lb/>
            to go into battle, or to pursue a gang of robbers: the priests <lb/>
            declared that the oracle promised him victory, and that he <lb/>
            should bring the necks of his enemies under the yoke, and reap <lb/>
            a rich harvest of booty</p>
          <p>My masters had gained no little money by this cheating <lb/>
            method of divination; but exhausted at last by perpetual in­ <lb/>
            terrogations for which they had but one answer, they again <lb/>
            departed by a road much worse than that which we had tra- <lb/>
            yelled the preceding night. The greater part of it was broken <lb/>
            up into deep ruts and holes full of water, and the rest was co­ <lb/>
            vered with thick mud and very slippery. At last, greatly <lb/>
            fatigued, and with my legs bruised by continually slipping and <note type="footnote"> * The Steers, —Inthe Latin : <lb/>

            falling, I had just reached a smooth bit of ground, when sud­ <lb/>
            denly a body of armed men on horseback galloped down upon <lb/>
            us, and after pulling up with difficulty, seized Philebus and <lb/>
            his companions by the throat, and beat them with their fists, <lb/>
            calling them sacrilegious, obscene villains. Then they hand­ <lb/>
            cuffed them all, and bellowed to them to produce the golden <lb/>
            bowl they had stolen. "Produce," they shouted, "that proof <lb/>
            of your crime, which you filched from the very shrine of the <lb/>
            Mother of the Gods, when you shut yourselves up in her tem­ <lb/>
            ple, under pretence of solemnizing secret rites; and then you <lb/>
            quitted the town before daylight without saying a word to any <lb/>
            one, as if you thought you could escape punishment for such <lb/>
            abominable guilt." Meanwhile, one of them searching the <lb/>
            goddess I carried on my back, found the gold cup in her bosom, <lb/>
            and drew it forth in the eight of all present. But even that <lb/>
            palpable evidence could not abash or dismay those nefarious <lb/>
            wretches, but affecting to laugh, and to turn the affair into a <lb/>
            joke, they exclaimed: "What an untoward accident! How <lb/>
            often the innocent are put in jeopardy! Here are ministers of <lb/>
            religion put in peril of their lives only for a cup which the <lb/>
            Mother of the Gods made a present to her sister, the Syrian <lb/>
            Goddess, as a pledge of hospitality." But in spite of all such <lb/>
            frivolous excuses, the rustics marched them back, and lodged <lb/>
            them in prison; and the cup and the image I had carried <lb/>
            having been solemnly deposited in the temple, I was brought <lb/>
            forth on the following day, and again offered for sale by the <lb/>
            voice of the crier. A certain baker from the next town bought <lb/>
            me for seven denars more than Philebus had given for me; <lb/>
            and putting on my back a good load of corn he had just bought, <lb/>
            he took me to his mill by a very rough road, full of stones and <lb/>
            roots of trees.</p>
          <p>There were a good many beasts employed there, in turning <lb/>
            several millstones, and that not only by day, but all night long <lb/>
            too, for the mill was always kept going. Lest I should be <lb/>
            disgusted with the beginning of my servitude, my new master <lb/>
            treated me with all the honours due to a stranger of consider­ <lb/>
            ation, and I had a holiday, and a manger abundantly supplied; <lb/>
            but the beatitude of having nothing to do and plenty to eat did <lb/>
            not last beyond the first day. On the following day, I was <lb/>
            fastened up to turn what seemed to me the largest mill­ <lb/>
            stone of all, and with my head covered I was put into a little <lb/>
             <pb n="174"/>
            hollow path in the form of a circle, in which I was to go round <lb/>
            and round perpetually. But I had not so far forgotten my old <lb/>
            cunning as to fall in easily with this new discipline; and though <lb/>
            when I was a man I had often seen machines of that kind re­ <lb/>
            volve, yet, as if I was quite a novice at the work, and did not <lb/>
            know what to do, I stood stock still, pretending stupefaction. <lb/>
            I imagined that when they saw I was not fit for the work, they <lb/>
            would put me to something else that was less fatiguing, or that <lb/>
            they would let me eat and do nothing. But my craft, instead <lb/>
            of doing me good, only brought me into trouble. For several <lb/>
            men armed with sticks came round me while I suspected no­ <lb/>
            thing, for my head was covered and I could not see ; and at a <lb/>
            given signal they all shouted out together, and let fall upon <lb/>
            me a storm of blows. I was so terrified by the uproar, that, <lb/>
            abandoning all thoughts of trickery, and pulling at the trace <lb/>
            with all my might, I paced the ring nimbly, and excited a <lb/>
            general burst of laughter by my. sudden change of behaviour.</p>
          <p>The day was near its end, I was very tired, when they loosed <lb/>
            the rush ropes that fastened me to the mill, and let me go to the <lb/>
            manger. Though exhausted with fatigue and hunger, and in <lb/>
            great need of having my strength recruited, yet prompted by <lb/>
            my natural curiosity, I neglected the food that was before me <lb/>
            to observe with a sort of pleasure the economy of our detest­ <lb/>
            able work-place. 0 gods! what a set of stunted men I saw <lb/>
            there! Their skins were seamed all over with marks of the <lb/>
            lash; their scarred backs were shaded rather than covered <lb/>
            with tattered frocks; some had only aprons; and all were so <lb/>
            clothed, that their skin was visible through the rents in their <lb/>
            rags. Their foreheads were branded with letters ; their heads <lb/>
            were half shaved; they had irons on their legs; they were <lb/>
            hideously sallow; their eyes were bleared, and sore and raw <lb/>
            from the smoke of the ovens; * and they were covered with <lb/>
            flour, as athletes are with dust when they contend in the arena.</p>
          <p>But how shall I describe my brute companions? What <lb/>
            worn-out old mules and geldings ! How they hung their heads <lb/>
            at the manger as they chewed the heaps of straw! Their necks <lb/>
            were covered with putrid sores; they coughed incessantly, and <lb/>
            panted through their gaping nostrils; their chests were raw <lb/>
            from the friction of the rush breast rope ; their flanks laid <note type="footnote"> * The smoke of the ovens.]—The miller's and the baker's trade were <lb/>

            open to the bone with continual cudgelling; their hoofs <lb/>
            lengthened to an extraordinary degree by dint of walking in <lb/>
            the mill round; and their hides were rough all over with <lb/>
            mange. Beholding the wretched plight of those animals, whom <lb/>
            I myself might be brought to resemble, and recollecting my <lb/>
            own happy fortune when I was Lucius, I hung my head and <lb/>
            sorrowed over the deep degradation into which I had fallen. <lb/>
            The only consolation I had was in the pleasure of indulging <lb/>
            my inborn curiosity, by observing all that was said and done <lb/>
            around me without reserve, for no one took any account of my <lb/>
            presence. Truly, it was with good reason that the divine <lb/>
            author of the ancient Greek epos, wishing to depict a man of <lb/>
            consummate wisdom and prudence, sang of one who had visited <lb/>
            many cities and become acquainted with many peoples.* I <lb/>
            myself hold my asinine days in grateful remembrance, be­ <lb/>
            cause, being hidden under that form, I went through a great <lb/>
            number of adventures, which made me acquainted with many <lb/>
            things, if they have not rendered me wiser. Thus I picked <lb/>
            up an excellent story, which particularly interested me, and <lb/>
            which you shall hear.</p>
          <p>The baker who had bought me was a worthy, well-conducted <lb/>
            man, but suffered the most cruel domestic affliction in conse­ <lb/>
            quence of having to wife the wickedest of all women; inso­ <lb/>
            much, that even I often groaned in secret over his sad lot. <lb/>
            There was not one vice from which that nefarious woman was <lb/>
            free; but every kind of iniquity had flowed into her soul, as <lb/>
            into a cesspool for the reception of all uncleanness. She was <lb/>
            mischievous, malignant, addicted to men and to wine, froward <lb/>
            and stubborn, vilely rapacious, unbounded in profusion, a foe <lb/>
            to faith and chastity. Moreover, despising and trampling <lb/>
            under foot the majesty of heaven, instead of the true religion, <lb/>
            she affected to entertain some fantastic and sacrilegious notion <lb/>
            of a God whom she declared to be the only one,† and under <note type="footnote"> * With many peoples.]—He alludes to Homer's account of Ulysses, in <lb/>

            woman of the most flagitious character, Apuleius thought to give likelihood <lb/>
            to a portrait that might otherwise have seemed overcharged and unna­ <lb/>
            tural, by making this paragon of wickedness a Christian. Nothing was <lb/>
            too bad to be believed on trust of that decried sect in those days. But <lb/>
            such virulent prejudice was not peculiarto pagan times. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="176"/>
            pretence of certain frivolous observances with which she im­ <lb/>
            posed upon the public and beguiled her unfortunate husband, <lb/>
            she got drunk in the morning, and prostituted her body at all <lb/>
            hours.</p>
          <p>This woman persecuted me with amazing rancour. For <lb/>
            before the dawn of morning, as she lay still in bed, she used <lb/>
            to call out and bid them yoke the new ass to the mill; as soon <lb/>
            as she was up she used to order me to be drubbed without <lb/>
            stint in her presence ; and when the cattle were unyoked at <lb/>
            breakfast-time, she would order me to be kept from the manger <lb/>
            long after the rest. These cruelties greatly whetted my natu­ <lb/>
            ral curiosity to scrutinize her behaviour. I perceived that a <lb/>
            certain young fellow was continually going into her room, and <lb/>
            I greatly longed to catch sight of his face, if the covering put <lb/>
            on my head had only allowed me the use of my eyes; in that <lb/>
            case I should not have wanted sagacity enough to discover in <lb/>
            some way or other the criminal proceedings of the abandoned <lb/>
            woman.</p>
          <p>A certain old woman, who was her confidante, and the go- <lb/>
            between in her intrigues, was with her every day from morn- <lb/>
            in- to night. After breakfasting together, they used to sit and <lb/>
            drink neat wine as if for a wager, all the while devising schemes <lb/>
            to cheat the unfortunate husband. Now, though I was greatly <lb/>
            vexed at the blunder committed by Fotis, who had made an <lb/>
            ass of me when intending to change me into a bird, yet I had <lb/>
            at least this comfort in my lamentable deformity, that being <lb/>
            furnished with very long ears, I could hear what was said <lb/>
            even at a great distance. One day, for example, I heard the <lb/>
            squeaking old woman talk as follows :</p>
          <p>“Make up your mind, mistress, what you will do with that <lb/>
            pluckless acquaintance you chose without consulting me, a <lb/>
            coward that shudders at the grim frown of your sour and <lb/>
            odious husband, and torments you by the laggard weakness of <lb/>
            his love, that corresponds so ill with your own warmth. What a <lb/>
            different man is Philesietæros! young, handsome, generous, met­ <lb/>
            tlesome, and more than a match for all the useless vigilance of <lb/>
            husbands. By Hercules! he is the only man that deserves to <lb/>
            enjoy the embraces of all the ladies of quality, he alone de­ <lb/>
            serves to be crowned with gold, if it was only for that capital <lb/>
            trick he lately played on a jealous husband. Listen, now, and <lb/>
            see the difference between such a man and your lover. You <pb n="177"/>
            <note type="margin"> BOOK IX. </note> <lb/>
            know one Barbarus, the decurion* of our town, whom the <lb/>
            people nickname Scorpion, on account of his peevish, spiteful <lb/>
            disposition. He has a wife of a good family, and surpassing <lb/>
            beauty, whom he keeps shut up at home with all the caution <lb/>
            imaginable."</p>
          <p>"To be sure," said the miller's wife, "I know her very <lb/>
            well. You mean my schoolfellow, Arete ?"</p>
          <p>"Then you know the whole story about Philesietærus?” <lb/>
            rejoined the old woman.</p>
          <p>" Not at all," replied the other; but I long to hear it, so <lb/>
            tell it all, mother, from beginning to end." Accordingly, the <lb/>
            qld woman, who was an interminable chatterer, began as fol­ <lb/>
            lows :</p>

          </ab>
          <p>" THIS Barbarus, being obliged to go a journey which he could <lb/>
            not avoid, and wishing to take all possible measures to keep <lb/>
            his dear wife faithful to him, secretly communicated his inten­ <lb/>
            tions to his slave Myrmex, the one in whom he had most con­ <lb/>
            fidence, and ordered him to watch over the conduct of his mis­ <lb/>
            tress, threatening him with chains, and prison, and starvation, <lb/>
            and a torturing death to end all, if any man so much as touched <lb/>
            her with the tip of his finger as he passed her in the street; <lb/>
            and all these threats he confirmed with the most solemn oaths. <lb/>
            Having thus left Myrmex terribly frightened and disposed to <lb/>
            keep a most vigilant watch over his wife, Barbarus set out on <lb/>
            his journey without fear of bad consequences.</p>
          <p>" Intensely anxious about his charge, Myrmex would never <lb/>
            let his mistress go out alone. He kept her shut up all day <lb/>
            spinning wool, always under his own eye; and when it was <lb/>
            necessary for her to go in the evening to the public baths, he <lb/>
            went with her, sticking like glue to her side, and holding the <lb/>
            skirt of her robe in his hand, so wonderfully awake was he to <lb/>
            all the duties of his trust.</p>
          <p>" But the beauty of the lady could not escape one who was <lb/>
            so keen-sighted in matters of gallantry as was Philesietærus; <lb/>
            but what piqued and incited him above all things, was the <lb/>
            repute of her impregnable virtue, and the extraordinary care <lb/>
            with which it was guarded. He resolved, then, to lay siege <note type="footnote"> *Decurion.] — The ' decuriones' were the senators of the Roman <lb/>
            ' municipia,' or free towns. </note> <note type="footnote"> N </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="178"/>
            with all his might to the house in which she was immured, <lb/>
            and to make his way in at all costs and hazards, in spite of its <lb/>
            commander's vigorous discipline. And knowing well the frailty <lb/>
            of human nature, and that gold can smooth down all difficul­ <lb/>
            ties, and break open adamantine gates, he addressed himself to <lb/>
            Myrmex, whom he fortunately met alone, told him of his love <lb/>
            for his mistress, and conjured him to afford some remedy for <lb/>
            his torments; assuring him that his speedy death was certain, <lb/>
            if his desires were not quickly fulfilled. 'Besides,' said he, <lb/>
            ' you have nothing to fear in so easy a matter as that which I <lb/>
            ask of you; since no more is required than that I should steal <lb/>
            into your house alone, under cover of darkness, and remain <lb/>
            there only a moment.' These insinuating arguments he fol­ <lb/>
            lowed by the application of a wedge that was well adapted to <lb/>
            cleave asunder the stubborn toughness of the servant's resolu­ <lb/>
            tion ; for holding out a handful of shining gold coin fresh from <lb/>
            the mint, he told him that twenty of them were for the lady, <lb/>
            and that ten of them should be freely at his own service.</p>
          <p>" Terrified at the stupendous proposal, Myrmex took to his <lb/>
            heels at once, without listening to another word. But he could <lb/>
            not get the lustre of the yellow gold out of his sight; and <lb/>
            though he had left it behind, and had never stopped running <lb/>
            till he got home, he still seemed to behold the beautiful coin, <lb/>
            and clutched it in imagination. Miserably was the poor <lb/>
            fellow distracted between opposite feelings: he thought of <lb/>
            the fidelity he owed his master, and then of his own gain; <lb/>
            the fear of horrible punishment made him hang back; the <lb/>
            bewitching thought of that money lured him on. At last the <lb/>
            gold prevailed over the fear of death, and time by no means <lb/>
            allayed his longing for that lovely coin; it clung to him like a <lb/>
            pestilence even through the anxious night; so that while his <lb/>
            master's threats would have detained him at home, yet the <lb/>
            gold irresistibly summoned him abroad. Gulping down all <lb/>
            shame, therefore, he went straightway to his mistress, and de­ <lb/>
            livered his message from Philesietærus; and she, a wanton <lb/>
            born, at once sold her virtue for cursed metal. So Myrmex, <lb/>
            deluged with joy at the wreck of his fidelity, and eager to <lb/>
            finger the gold which it was his ill fate to have seen, went in <lb/>
            quest of Philesietærus, and told him that at last, with great <lb/>
            difficulty, he had effected his wishes. Then he asked on the <lb/>
            epot for the promised recompense, and suddenly found himself <pb n="179"/>
            <note type="margin"> BOOK IX. </note> <lb/>
            possessed of a handful of gold coin, he who had never in his <lb/>
            life been master of a copper.</p>
          <p>“When night was come, he conducted the bold gallant, <lb/>
            alone and with his face well muffled, to the house, and into his <lb/>
            mistress's chamber. But just as the pair were paying their <lb/>
            first adorations to Love, just as the naked recruits in the war­ <lb/>
            fare of Venus were performing their first service, the husband, <lb/>
            who had chosen that time of night on purpose, arrived sud­ <lb/>
            denly at the moment when he was least expected. He knocked, <lb/>
            he called, he pounded at the door with a stone, and growing more <lb/>
            and more suspicious in consequence of the delay, he threat­ <lb/>
            ened terrible vengeance against Myrmex, who was so bewildered <lb/>
            by the sudden calamity that he knew not what to do, and could <lb/>
            only excuse himself by saying that the darkness'of the night <lb/>
            had hindered him from finding the key, which he had hidden <lb/>
            with great care. Meanwhile, Philesietærus, alarmed, by the <lb/>
            noise, hastily put on his clothes, and ran out of the bedroom, <lb/>
            but forgot in his confusion to thrust his feet into his shoes.</p>
          <p>“ Then Myrmex put the key in the lock and let in his mas­ <lb/>
            ter, who was still bawling and swearing with all his might; <lb/>
            and whilst the latter hurried to his chamber, Myrmex let Phi­ <lb/>
            lesietærus slip out unperceived, shut the door behind him, and <lb/>
            went back to his bed with his mind quite at ease. But when <lb/>
            Barbarus got up in the morning, he saw a strange pair of shoes <lb/>
            under the bed ; and instantly suspecting what had happened, <lb/>
            but saying not a word to his wife or any of the servants, he <lb/>
            took up the shoes unobserved and hid them in his bosom; then <lb/>
            ordering Myrmex to be bound and marched off to the forum, <lb/>
            he went thither himself, groaning inwardly, and assuring him­ <lb/>
            self he should trace out the adulterer by means of the shoes.</p>
          <p>" As Barbarus walked along the street with lowering brows <lb/>
            and a face swollen with rage, Myrmex followed him in chains. <lb/>
            He had not, indeed, been taken in the fact, but overwhelmed <lb/>
            by a guilty conscience, he cried and lamented, so as to excite <lb/>
            the useless compassion of the beholders. Philesietærus hap­ <lb/>
            pened very opportunely to pass that way, and though he had <lb/>
            business which called him elsewhere, yet being forcibly struck, <lb/>
            but not dismayed, by the spectacle that suddenly came before <lb/>
            him, he recollected the mistake he had made in his haste, and <lb/>
            immediately inferring all the consequences, he acted on the <lb/>
            spot with his usual cleverness and presence of mind. Pushing <note type="footnote"> N2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="180"/>
            aside the other servants, he rushed upon Myrmex, bawling at <lb/>
            him with all his might, and hitting him on the face with his <lb/>
            fists, but so as not to hurt him much : ' Villain and liar !' he <lb/>
            cried, 'may your master and all the gods, by whose names <lb/>
            you forswear yourself, punish you as such a rascal deserves ! <lb/>
            You that stole my shoes yesterday from the bath. You de­ <lb/>
            serve, by Hercules, to have those chains upon you until they <lb/>
            are worn out, and to be shut up for ever in the darkness of a <lb/>
            dungeon.'</p>
          <p>" Completely duped and befooled by the ready-witted strata­ <lb/>
            gem of the bold youth, Barbarus went back to his house, called <lb/>
            Myrmex before him, and putting the shoes into his hands, for­ <lb/>
            gave him with all his heart, and advised him to return them to <lb/>
            their owner from whom he had stolen them."</p>
          <p>END OF THE TENTH EPISODE.</p>
          <p>No sooner had the old woman ended her story, than the <lb/>
            baker's wife cried out: " Happy is the woman who has such a <lb/>
            stout-hearted lover as that; while I, poor thing, have got one <lb/>
            that trembles at the mere sound of the mill, and even at the <lb/>
            hoodwinked face of that mangy ass."</p>
          <p>" Never mind," said the old woman. " I will engage to <lb/>
            bring you this brisk lad presently, well inclined, and in good <lb/>
            courage." Then, having arranged to return in the evening, <lb/>
            she went away.</p>
          <p>The chaste wife forthwith set about preparing a banquet fit <lb/>
            for priests. She filtered choice wine, made fresh savoury ra­ <lb/>
            gouts, and furnished out an abundant table. In short, she <lb/>
            made ready for her paramour's arrival as for that of some god; <lb/>
            for it happened conveniently for her, that her husband supped <lb/>
            abroad with his neighbour the fuller. The hour of noon hav­ <lb/>
            ing arrived, I was released from the mill, and let go to feed; <lb/>
            but what pleased me most was, not that I had a respite from <lb/>
            drudgery, but that having my head uncovered and the free use <lb/>
            of my eyes, I could watch all the doings of that wicked wo­ <lb/>
            man. At last, when the sun had sunk beneath the ocean to <lb/>
            illuminate the inferior zones of the earth, in came the bold <lb/>
            gallant alongside of the wicked old hag. He was quite young, <lb/>
            with smooth blooming cheeks, and very handsome. The miller's <lb/>
            wife received him with all sorts of caresses, and the supper <lb/>
            being ready, she made him take his place at the table.</p><pb n="181"/>
            
          <p><note type="margin">BOOK IX. </note> But scarcely had he put his lips to the preparatory potion, <lb/>
            taken by way of a whet, when the husband was heard return­ <lb/>
            ing much sooner than he had been expected. Thereupon, his <lb/>
            exemplary wife, heaping all sorts of curses upon him, and <lb/>
            wishing he had broken his legs, hid the pale and trembling <lb/>
            youth under a bin for sifting corn which happened to be at <lb/>
            hand; then, with a face of perfect composure, she asked her <lb/>
            husband why he had so soon quitted the entertainment of his <lb/>
            crony, and returned home.</p>
          <p>The miller, who seemed greatly distressed, replied, with a <lb/>
            sigh: "I hurried away because I could not endure the abo­ <lb/>
            minable guilt of his abandoned wife. Good gods! what a <lb/>
            faithful, well-conducted matron she seemed, and how infa­ <lb/>
            mously she has disgraced herself! I swear by yonder sacred <lb/>
            Ceres, that even yet I can hardly believe the evidence of my <lb/>
            own eyes against such a woman."</p>
          <p>The miller's impudent wife hearing her husband talk thus, <lb/>
            and being curious to hear the whole story, pressed him to re­ <lb/>
            late all that had happened; and never ceased importuning <lb/>
            him until he yielded, and began to relate to her the disgrace <lb/>
            of his neighbour's house, while he yet knew not of his own.</p>

          </ab>
          <p>" THE wife of my old comrade, the fuller," said he, "who <lb/>
            appeared a very honest woman, and bore the best character, and <lb/>
            seemed to manage her husband's house with great propriety, <lb/>
            fell in love with a certain man, and as they saw each other <lb/>
            frequently in secret, it happened that when the fuller and <lb/>
            I returned from the baths to supper, the pair were then in the <lb/>
            very act.</p>
          <p>" Startled and confused by our sudden arrival, the woman <lb/>
            could do no better on the instant than hide her paramour under <lb/>
            a very high wicker cage, hung round with cloths, which were <lb/>
            exposed there to the bleaching fumes of sulphur burned be­ <lb/>
            neath them. Having thus concealed him, quite safely as she <lb/>
            thought, she came and sat down with us to supper. Mean­ <lb/>
            while, the young man was obliged to breathe the suffocating <lb/>
            vapour of the sulphur; and, according to the usual effect of that <lb/>
            acrid and penetrating mineral, he was forced to sneeze re­ <lb/>
             <pb n="182"/>
            peatedly. The husband, who was opposite his wife at table, <lb/>
            hearing the sound that came from behind her, thought it was <lb/>
            herself that sneezed, and said, ' Jove save you !' as usual on <lb/>
            such occasions. This happened a second, a third, and many <lb/>
            more times in succession; till at last, surprised at these endless <lb/>
            sneezings, he began to suspect the real state of the case, and <lb/>
            pushing aside the table, he upset the cage, and discovered the <lb/>
            man, who lay panting for breath, and almost suffocated.</p>
          <p>“Transported with rage at the outrage done him, he shouted <lb/>
            for his sword, and would have cut the throat of the half-dead <lb/>
            wretch, had I not, with great difficulty, restrained him from an <lb/>
            act which would have been perilous to us all, by assuring him <lb/>
            that his enemy would soon die from the effect of the sulphurous <lb/>
            fumes, without our making ourselves guilty of his death. <lb/>
            Yielding not so much to my persuasions as to the necessity of <lb/>
            the case, he dragged the half-lifeless young man into the next <lb/>
            lane ; and then I pressed his wife, and at last prevailed upon <lb/>
            her, to quit the house and take refuge with some of her friends, <lb/>
            until time should have somewhat cooled her husband's boiling <lb/>
            rage; for I made no doubt but that, in the furious exaspera­ <lb/>
            tion he then exhibited, he would proceed to some desperate <lb/>
            extremity against her and himself too. I had now had more <lb/>
            than enough of my friend's entertainment, and so I returned <lb/>
            home."</p>
          <p>END OF THE ELEVENTH EPISODE.</p>
          <p>Whilst the miller was telling this story, his wife, with un­ <lb/>
            paralleled effrontery, broke out from time to time with invec­ <lb/>
            tives and curses upon the fuller's wife, calling her a perfidious. <lb/>
            wretch, a shameless strumpet, an opprobrium to her whole <lb/>
            sex, to fling aside all sense of honour and decency; to trample <lb/>
            on the obligations of the marriage-bed; to turn her husband's <lb/>
            house into an infamous brothel; to have abandoned the dignity <lb/>
            cf a married woman, and earned for herself the name of a <lb/>
            prostitute. Such women, she said, ought to be burnt alive.</p>
          <p>Conscious, however, of her own secret guilt, she pressed her <lb/>
            husband to go to bed early, that she might the sooner relieve <lb/>
            her gallant from the misery of his confinement; but the miller <lb/>
            having been disappointed of his supper at the fuller's, and <lb/>
            having returned home hungry, requested her to have the table <lb/>
            laid. She quickly served him up, but with anything but good <pb n="183"/>
            <note type="margin"> BOOK IX. </note> <lb/>
            will, the: supper she had provided for another. Meanwhile, <lb/>
            my very entrails were racked when I thought of the late do­ <lb/>
            ings and present effrontery of that abominable woman; and I <lb/>
            pondered anxiously in my mind whether I could not find some <lb/>
            means of doing a service to my master by disclosing her <lb/>
            treachery; and whether I could not expose the young fellow <lb/>
            to the eyes of every body, by upsetting the bin under which he <lb/>
            was squatting like a tortoise.</p>
          <p>Whilst I was thus distracted by the thought of the outrage <lb/>
            done my master, the providence of the gods came to my aid. <lb/>
            For a lame old man, who had charge of the horses and other <lb/>
            beasts of burthen, seeing it was the time to give us water, <lb/>
            came to drive us all to the next pond. This afforded me a <lb/>
            most favourable opportunity for vengeance. I noticed, as I <lb/>
            passed, that the young gallant's fingers projected beyond the <lb/>
            edge of the bin, and pressing the point of my hoof on them I <lb/>
            squeezed them flat, so that yelling with the intolerable pain, <lb/>
            and throwing off his cover, he stood manifest to every eye, and <lb/>
            unmasked the falsehood of that libidinous woman.</p>
          <p>The miller did not seem greatly shocked by the disclosure <lb/>
            of his wife's debauchery, but began with a mild and quiet <lb/>
            countenance to reassure the lad, who trembled all over, and <lb/>
            was pale as death. " Don't be afraid, my boy," he said; " I <lb/>
            am not a barbarian, or a man of rough and savage ways. I <lb/>
            will not smoke you to death with sulphur; nor will I put such <lb/>
            a pretty boy as you into the hands of justice, to suffer the se­ <lb/>
            vere penalties of the law against adultery. But I will come <lb/>
            to an arrangement with my wife, not, however, for a division <lb/>
            of property; no, I will rather make a partnership affair of it, so <lb/>
            that, without any dispute or disagreement, we three may make <lb/>
            ourselves comfortable in one bed. I have always lived with <lb/>
            my wife on such harmonious terms, that, as became discreet <lb/>
            people, what the one liked the other liked also. But common <lb/>
            justice demands that the wife should not have more authority <lb/>
            than the husband."</p>
          <p>After quietly joking in this way, he made the unwilling <lb/>
            youth go with him to his chamber, and shutting out his modest <lb/>
            wife, he exacted what he thought a pleasant sort of vengeance <lb/>
            for the wrong done to his bed. But when the sun had risen <lb/>
            next morning, he called for two of the strongest of his work­ <lb/>
            people, who hoisted the lad, while the miller himself flogged <lb/>
             <pb n="184"/>
            his buttocks with a rod. “What!” said he, "you, who are <lb/>
            so soft and tender, a mere boy, you hanker after women, do <lb/>
            you ? And nothing will suit you but women of free condition, <lb/>
            that have got husbands; you have such a precocious longing <lb/>
            for the reputation of an adulterer." After reprimanding him <lb/>
            in this sort of way, and giving him a right good flogging, he <lb/>
            thrust him out of doors. And thus did that most enterprising <lb/>
            of all gallants escape far better than he had hoped for, but in <lb/>
            woful plight and with aching buttocks.</p>
          <p>The baker, moreover, divorced his wife, and made her quit <lb/>
            his house forthwith. Thereupon the woman's natural mali-,- <lb/>
            nity being exasperated by this affront, however well deserved, <lb/>
            she had recourse to her familiar weapons, and to the customary <lb/>
            devices of women. She sought out with diligence a certain <lb/>
            nefarious woman, who was believed to be able to do whatever <lb/>
            she pleased by means of her enchantments and drugs ; her she <lb/>
            loaded with presents, and importunately besought her to do <lb/>
            one of two things : either to soften the heart of her husband, <lb/>
            that he might be reconciled to her; or if that could not be <lb/>
            done, to send at least some ghost, or some dire demoniacal <lb/>
            power, to take away his life by violent means. Upon this, the <lb/>
            witch, who was capable of exercising an influence upon the <lb/>
            gods, employed at first only the milder resources of her wicked <lb/>
            art, and endeavoured to influence the feelings of the husband <lb/>
            that had been so seriously offended, and lead them back to their <lb/>
            former affection. When, however, the result turned out to be <lb/>
            quite different from what she had anticipated, being incensed <lb/>
            with the gods, for the contempt with which they had treated <lb/>
            her, as well as by the loss of the gain which was to have been <lb/>
            hers, if she succeeded, she now began to level her attacks <lb/>
            against the life of the unfortunate husband, and to stimulate <lb/>
            to his destruction the ghost of a certain woman, who had met <lb/>
            with a violent death.</p>
          <p>Perhaps, however, 0 scrupulous reader, you will carp at my <lb/>
            story, and will reason as follows: “How is it possible, you <lb/>
            silly ass, that you could know, as you say you did, what was <lb/>
            done by women in secret, when at the very moment you were <lb/>
            pent up within a bakehouse ?" Hear, then, how I, an inquisi­ <lb/>
            tive man, wearing the shape of a beast of burden, came to know <lb/>
            all that was transacted with a view to the destruction of my <lb/>
            master, the baker.</p>
          <p>About midday there suddenly appeared in the bakehouse a <pb n="185"/>
            <note type="margin"> BOOK IX. </note> <lb/>
            woman of a hideous aspect, marked by guilt and extreme sor­ <lb/>
            row ; she was half clad in a patched mourning mantle, her feet <lb/>
            were naked, and her haggard face was sallow as boxwood. <lb/>
            Her grizzly, dishevelled hair, defiled with ashes, hung over her <lb/>
            forehead, and concealed the greater part of her face. This <lb/>
            strange-looking woman, taking the baker gently by the hand, <lb/>
            led him aside into his chamber, as if she had something to <lb/>
            say to him in secret, and having shut the door, remained there <lb/>
            a very long time.</p>
          <p>However, when all the wheat was ground which had been <lb/>
            delivered out to the workmen, and it became necessary to get <lb/>
            more, the servants went to the door of the chamber, and calling <lb/>
            to their master, asked for more wheat for the mill. But as no <lb/>
            master answered them, though they shouted to him again and <lb/>
            again, they began to knock more loudly at the door. Finding, <lb/>
            too, that it had been carefully bolted, they suspected something <lb/>
            tragical had occurred, and making a violent effort, they tore <lb/>
            the door off the hinges, and rushed in. The woman, however, <lb/>
            was no where to be found, but they saw their master hanging <lb/>
            lifeless from a beam. Loosening the rope from his neck, they <lb/>
            took him down, and with great lamentations and weeping, <lb/>
            bestowed upon the corpse the last ablution. Finally, having <lb/>
            performed the customary offices for the dead, they committed <lb/>
            him to the tomb, a great crowd attending the funeral.</p>
          <p>On the following day, his daughter came running from the <lb/>
            neighbouring village, where she had lately been married, full <lb/>
            of sorrow, shaking her dishevelled hair, and ever and anon <lb/>
            beating her breasts with her hands. For she had discovered <lb/>
            all that happened, although no one living had related to her <lb/>
            the misfortune that had befallen the family; but the piteous <lb/>
            form of her father had presented itself to her in her sleep, <lb/>
            his neck still bound with the halter, and disclosed to her all <lb/>
            the wickedness of her stepmother, her infidelity, the en­ <lb/>
            chantment, and how he had been strangled by a ghost, and <lb/>
            had descended to the realms below. After she had given way <lb/>
            to long-continued lamentations, at last, being prevailed upon <lb/>
            by the united entreaties of her friends and acquaintances, she <lb/>
            put an end to her wailings. And now, the funeral solemnities <lb/>
            being in the usual manner completed at the tomb, on the ninth <lb/>
            day, she had the slaves, the furniture, and all the beasts of <lb/>
            burden, brought forth to be sold by auction, for the benefit of <lb/>
             <pb n="186"/>
            the heiress. Then did capricious fortune, by the chance results <lb/>
            of a sale, disperse in various ways the property of one house.</p>
          <p>A poor gardener made purchase of me for fifty pieces of <lb/>
            money, which he said was a great price; but he paid it in order <lb/>
            that he might procure subsistence for himself by our common <lb/>
            labour. The occasion appears to me to require that I shoul I <lb/>
            explain the nature of these services of mine. Every morning, <lb/>
            my master was in the habit of leading me to the next city, <lb/>
            with a heavy load of vegetables; and after he had sold them <lb/>
            to the general dealers there, he returned to his garden, sitting <lb/>
            on my back. Then, while he was digging and watering, and <lb/>
            was busied with other laborious employments, I was left to <lb/>
            take my ease, and refresh myself with silence and rest. But, <lb/>
            lo! the revolving year had now, after the autumn delights of <lb/>
            the vintage, descended to the wintry frosts of Capricorn;* <lb/>
            and then I was perished with continual cold, through the <lb/>
            constant rains and the nightly dews, being exposed to the open <lb/>
            air in a stable without a roof. For my master, in consequence <lb/>
            of his extreme poverty, could not purchase even for himself, <lb/>
            much less for me, any straw, or bed-clothes, his only protec­ <lb/>
            tion from the cold being the thatch of his little cottage. <lb/>
            Besides this, in the morning I had to endure great fatigue, <lb/>
            in walking with unshod feet on clay that was quite frozen, <lb/>
            and pieces of very sharp ice; and I never even got a bellyful <lb/>
            of food. For both my master and myself had meals alike in <lb/>
            quality and quantity, and very meagre they were; since they <lb/>
            consisted of old and unsavoury lettuces, which had run to seed, <lb/>
            looked just like so many brooms, and were full of a clammy, <lb/>
            bitter juice, that smelt disgustingly.</p>
          <p>One night, a householder who lived in the next village, <lb/>
            having lost his way through the darkness of a moonless night, <lb/>
            and got drenched to the skin with rain, turned with his wea­ <lb/>
            ried horse into our garden; and being as courteously received <lb/>
            as circumstances would allow of, and being invited to tako <lb/>
            there a night's repose, which, if not surrounded by many re­ <lb/>
            finements, was at all events very welcome, he desired to make a <lb/>
            present to his hospitable entertainer, and promised that he <lb/>
            would give him from his farm some corn and oil, and two casks <lb/>
            of wine. My master therefore proceeded, without delay, to <note type="footnote"> * Capricorn.]—The sun enters the sign Capricorn at the beginning of <lb/>
            winter. </note> <pb n="187"/>
            <note type="margin"> BOOK IX. </note> <lb/>
            the farm of the householder, which was distant from his garden <lb/>
            sixty stadia,*seated on my bare back, and carrying with him <lb/>
            a little sack, and some empty wineskins.</p>
          <p>The journey accomplished, we arrived at the farm, and there <lb/>
            the kind host immediately asked my master to partake of a <lb/>
            sumptuous entertainment. But while they were drinking <lb/>
            jovially, a most astonishing prodigy took place. One ofthe <lb/>
            hens in the poultry-yard, running through the middle of the <lb/>
            yard, kept up a continual cackling, as if she wanted to lay. <lb/>
            On this her master, looking at her, said, "Notable servant that <lb/>
            you are, and remarkably prolific, for this long time you have <lb/>
            treated us with your daily productions. And now, too, I see, <lb/>
            you are thinking about helping us to a dainty morsel. Boy!" <lb/>
            said he, speaking to one of his servants, “get the basket that <lb/>
            the hens lay in, and place it in the corner as usual." When <lb/>
            the boy had done as he was desired, the hen, refusing to go to <lb/>
            her nest as usual, produced before the very feet of her master <lb/>
            a premature offspring, and one of a singularly ominous nature. <lb/>
            For she did not bring forth an egg, as we usually see hens do, <lb/>
            but a chicken, perfectly formed, with feathers and claws, eyes <lb/>
            and voice; which immediately began to follow its mother <lb/>
            about.</p>
          <p>Another prodigy also occurred, of a far more astonishing <lb/>
            nature than the former, and at which all men might with <lb/>
            great reason be terrified. For, under the very table which <lb/>
            held the remnants of the entertainment, the earth opened with <lb/>
            a yawning chasm from its inmost depths, and a copious foun­ <lb/>
            tain of blood gushed forth; while numerous drops, as they <lb/>
            splashed about, sprinkled the table with gore. At that very <lb/>
            instant also, while every one was struck with astonishment <lb/>
            and dismay at these divine presages, one of the servants came <lb/>
            running from the wine cellar, and announced that all the wine, <lb/>
            that had long ago been racked off, was boiling up in all the <lb/>
            vessels, with a heat as if a large fire had been put under it. <lb/>
            In the meantime also, some weasels were observed, outside of <lb/>
            the house, dragging into it a dead serpent. Then, too, out of <lb/>
            the mouth of the sheep-dog jumped a small green frog; and a <lb/>
            ram that stood near him rushing on the same dog, strangled <lb/>
            him at a single grip. These numerous portents, and others of <lb/>
            a like nature, filled the minds of the master of the house and <note type="footnote"> * Sixty stadia.]—Seven miles and a half. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="188"/>
            all his family with intense amazement and terror; what was <lb/>
            to be done first or what last; what they ought especially to <lb/>
            do, and what they ought not to do to appease the anger of the <lb/>
            Gods; with how many and what sort of victims they should <lb/>
            make atonement, they were quite at a loss to decide.</p>
          <p>While all were stupefied with expectation of some dreadful <lb/>
            catastrophe, a servant came running in, and announced to the <lb/>
            master of the house a great and fearful visitation.</p>

          <p>THIS good man was the proud father of three sons, now <lb/>
            grown up, well educated, and remarkable for their good <lb/>
            conduct.</p>
          <p>Between these young men and a poor man, the owner of a <lb/>
            small cottage, there had been an intimacy of long standing. <lb/>
            Now, close adjoining to the humble cottage lay the extensive <lb/>
            and fertile domain of a wealthy and powerful young man, who <lb/>
            made but bad use of the influence derived from his high birth. <lb/>
            As he was powerful from the number of his dependents, and <lb/>
            did what he pleased in the city, he behaved in a very un­ <lb/>
            ceremonious manner to his poor neighbour, killing his sheep, <lb/>
            driving away his oxen, and trampling down his corn before <lb/>
            it was ripe. Already he had deprived him of all hopes of <lb/>
            a harvest, and now he wanted to expel him from the posses­ <lb/>
            sion even of his land. To this end, raising a frivolous ques­ <lb/>
            tion about the boundaries of the fields, he laid claim to the <lb/>
            whole of the land as his own.</p>
          <p>Upon this, the countryman, who was otherwise a mild, <lb/>
            harmless man, seeing himself plundered, through the avarice <lb/>
            of his rich neighbour, collected together a considerable number <lb/>
            of his friends, for the purpose of ascertaining what were the <lb/>
            actual boundaries of his land, in order that, at all events, he <lb/>
            might keep enough of his paternal land to dig himself a <lb/>
            grave. Among others, the three brothers were present, to <lb/>
            give such small assistance as best they might, in their friend's <lb/>
            extreme need. Still, the mad oppressor was not in the least <lb/>
            daunted, or even moved, by the presence of many citizens, and <lb/>
            was so far from being disposed to abstain from acts of rapine, <lb/>
            that he would not even confine himself to civil language. For, <pb n="189"/>
            <note type="margin"> BOOK IX. </note> <lb/>
            when they mildly expostulated with him, and endeavoured <lb/>
            to pacify his boisterous disposition by soothing words, he <lb/>
            swore in the most solemn manner by his own life and that <lb/>
            of his dearest relatives, that he cared but little for the inter­ <lb/>
            ference of so many arbitrators; and that, in fact, he would <lb/>
            forthwith order his servants to take that neighbour of his by <lb/>
            the ears, and drag him far away from his cottage, and banish <lb/>
            him altogether.</p>
          <p>His words aroused the greatest indignation in the minds of <lb/>
            all who heard him; and one of the three brothers answered, <lb/>
            without hesitation, and told him plainly, that it was in vain, <lb/>
            that trusting to his riches, he made such arrogant threats, <lb/>
            since the poor even can obtain redress against the insolence <lb/>
            of the wealthy, through the liberal protection of the laws. <lb/>
            What oil is to flame, what sulphur is to a conflagration, what <lb/>
            the whip is in the Fury's hand, such was the fuel afforded <lb/>
            by these words to the furious disposition of this man. Roused <lb/>
            to a perfect frenzy, and bidding them all, and their laws too, <lb/>
            go and be hanged, he ordered the shepherds' dogs to be let <lb/>
            loose, as well as those upon the farm, savage and blood-thirsty <lb/>
            creatures, accustomed to prey upon the dead carcases that were <lb/>
            thrown into the fields, and to bite and mangle the passing <lb/>
            traveller. Accordingly, incited by the well-known hallooing <lb/>
            of the shepherds, the dogs rushed upon the men, barking hor­ <lb/>
            ribly, and tore the flesh off their bones. Nor even when the <lb/>
            men fled did they spare them; but pursued them with so <lb/>
            much the more ferocity.</p>
          <p>In this scene of havoc and slaughter of the confused mul­ <lb/>
            titude, the youngest of the three brothers stumbled against a <lb/>
            stone, and was thrown to the ground, where he was devoured <lb/>
            by those ferocious dogs. The moment his brothers recog­ <lb/>
            nized his dying shrieks, they ran to help him, and wrapping <lb/>
            their cloaks around their left hands, used every effort to pro­ <lb/>
            tect their brother, and to drive off the dogs, by volleys of <lb/>
            stones. But they were unable to quell their ferocity; and <lb/>
            the unfortunate youth was torn in pieces, and died, entreating <lb/>
            with his breath, that they would avenge the death of their <lb/>
            youngest brother on that most villanous purse-proud man. <lb/>
            Then the two remaining surviving brothers, not, by Hercules, <lb/>
            eomuch despairing of, as spontaneously disregarding their <lb/>
             <pb n="190"/>
            own safety, made an attack upon the rich man, and with <lb/>
            furious impetuosity hurled a shower of stones against him. <lb/>
            Then the blood-thirsty wretch, who, before this, had been <lb/>
            trained by practice in many similar deeds of outrage, hurled a <lb/>
            lance, and pierced one of the two brothers through the middle <lb/>
            of the breast. And yet, though mortally wounded, the young <lb/>
            man did not fall to the ground. For the lance, which had <lb/>
            pierced him, and the greater part of which had come out <lb/>
            at his back, was by the force of the blow fixed in the earth, <lb/>
            and kept his body suspended by the firmness of the handle, <lb/>
            as it stood quivering in the ground. In addition to this, one <lb/>
            of the assassin's servants, a tall robust fellow, violently hurled <lb/>
            a stone from a distance, and tried to hit the third brother on <lb/>
            the right arm; but the stone, passing just by the tips of his <lb/>
            fingers, and so expending its force in vain, fell to the ground <lb/>
            without inflicting any injury, contrary to the expectation of <lb/>
            all who were present. Now as the youth was endowed with <lb/>
            singular presence of mind, this fortunate circumstance afforded <lb/>
            him some hope of revenge. For, pretending that his hand <lb/>
            was disabled, he thus addressed his most savage antagonist: <lb/>
            " Exult in the destruction of our whole family, glut your in­ <lb/>
            satiable vengeance with the blood of three brothers, and com­ <lb/>
            plete your glorious triumph over your prostrate fellow-citi­ <lb/>
            zens ; only remember, that after you have deprived this poor <lb/>
            man of his lands, extend and extend as you may, you will still <lb/>
            always have some neighbour or other. But this right hand of <lb/>
            mine, which should undoubtedly have struck off your head, <lb/>
            hangs powerless, smitten by the iniquitous decree of fate." <lb/>
            The furious cutthroat, exasperated by these words, seizing a <lb/>
            sword, rushed eagerly on the wretched youth, with the inten­ <lb/>
            tion of slaying him with his own hand. However, he had <lb/>
            provoked one who was not inferior to himself. For the youth, <lb/>
            quite contrary to his anticipation, seized hold of his right <lb/>
            hand with a most powerful grasp; and then brandishing his <lb/>
            sword, with repeated blows dismissed the impure soul of the <lb/>
            rich man from his body ; and lastly, to free himself from the <lb/>
            hands of the attendants who were running to give assistance, <lb/>
            he cut his own throat with the sword that was still reeking <lb/>
            with the blood of his enemy.</p>
          <p>END OF THE TWELFTH EPISODE.</p><pb n="191"/>
            
          <p><note type="margin">BOOK IX. </note> These were the events which the astounding prodigies had <lb/>
            foreshown; and these were the events which were related to <lb/>
            the most unfortunate master. The old man, overwhelmed by <lb/>
            so many misfortunes, could not so much as utter a single word, <lb/>
            or even shed a tear, but seizing the knife with which he had <lb/>
            just before been helping his guests to cheese and other viands, <lb/>
            he pierced his own throat with numerous gashes, thus following <lb/>
            the example of his most unhappy son; so that falling with his <lb/>
            face on the table, he washed away, with a river of flowing <lb/>
            blood, the stains of that portentous gore which had before <lb/>
            fallen upon it. The gardener, commiserating the fate of this <lb/>
            house, which had thus come to destruction in the shortest space <lb/>
            of time, and deploring his own mischance, made a return for <lb/>
            his meal with his tears, and ever and anon clasping together <lb/>
            his empty hands, immediately mounted on my back, and re­ <lb/>
            turned the way we came.</p>
          <p>His return, however, was by no means free from accident. <lb/>
            For a certain tall fellow, who was a soldier belonging to one <lb/>
            of the legions,* as his dress and appearance seemed to indicate, <lb/>
            met us on the road, and asked the gardener, in a haughty and <lb/>
            insolent tone, whither he was leading that unladen ass ? My <lb/>
            master, who was still full of grief, and was ignorant, besides, <lb/>
            of the Latin language, passed on without making any reply. <lb/>
            Upon this, the soldier could not control the insolence that was <lb/>
            so natural to him; but considering his silence as a mark of <lb/>
            contempt, thrust him from my back, at the same time striking <lb/>
            him with a vine-stick,†which he carried in his hand. The <lb/>
            gardener humbly declared that he did not understand what the <lb/>
            soldier said, being ignorant of the language in which he spoke. <lb/>
            The soldier, therefore, demanded in Greek, " Whither are you <lb/>
            leading that ass?" The gardener replied, that he was going <lb/>
            to the next town. " But I am in want of it," said the soldier; <note type="footnote"> * One of the legions.] — The Roman armies were composed of two <lb/>
            orders of soldiers, legionaries and auxiliaries ; the former were properly <lb/>
            Romans, the latter were drawn from nations allied to Rome. The legion­ <lb/>
            aries were treated with much more consideration than the auxiliaries. </note><note type="footnote"> t A vine-stick.]—This shows either that the soldier was a centurion <lb/>
            or that he assumed that rank to impose on the peasant; for it was pecu­ <lb/>
            liar to the centurions to carry vines, with which they chastised the soldiers <lb/>
            under their command. Hence, in Latin, a vine is metonymically used by <lb/>
            poets for the office of a centurion. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="192"/>
            " it must help, with other beasts, to carry from the neigh­ <lb/>
            bouring village the baggage of our commanding officer." With <lb/>
            that, laying hold of the rope by which I was led along, he <lb/>
            began to pull me away. The gardener, however, wiping away <lb/>
            the blood that trickled down his face from the blow he had <lb/>
            just received, again entreated the soldier to act more civilly <lb/>
            and humanely, and supplicated him to do so, by all his hopes <lb/>
            of future good fortune. "This ass," said he, " is very lazy, <lb/>
            and then besides, he has that abominable complaint, the falling <lb/>
            sickness; it is as much as he can do to carry a few bundles of <lb/>
            vegetables from my garden close by; it quite blows him; so <lb/>
            he is not a likely beast for the carriage of larger burdens."</p>
          <p>When, however, he found that the soldier could not be <lb/>
            softened by entreaties, but was still more and more savagely <lb/>
            bent on plundering him, and that now he had shifted his hold <lb/>
            of the vine-stick, and was preparing to fracture his skull with <lb/>
            the large knob at the end, he had recourse to his last chance. <lb/>
            deigning that he would embrace the soldier, in order to <lb/>
            excite his compassion, he bent down, and pulling both legs <lb/>
            from under him, dashed him violently to the ground; then <lb/>
            instantly throwing himself upon his sprawling antagonist, <lb/>
            he bit him, and thumped him, and jobbed him all over, <lb/>
            face, arms, and ribs, with his fists, his elbows, and with a <lb/>
            stone which he picked up in the road. As for the sol­ <lb/>
            dier, he could neither resist nor at all defend himself, from <lb/>
            the very moment that he was laid prostrate on the ground; <lb/>
            but could only threaten'from time to time that the moment he <lb/>
            got up he would cut him to pieces with his sword. The gar­ <lb/>
            dener, taking warning by this hint, snatched the sword from <lb/>
            his side, and throwing it far away, again pummelled him <lb/>
            harder than ever, so that the soldier, stretched on his back <lb/>
            and disabled with wounds and bruises, had to counterfeit death, <lb/>
            as the only means of saving his life. The gardener, then taking <lb/>
            the sword away with him, mounted my back, and made off at <lb/>
            my utmost speed straight towards the town ; and, not caring <lb/>
            to visit his own garden, at all events for the present, he directed <lb/>
            his steps towards the house of an intimate friend of his. After <lb/>
            relating all the circumstances, he begged and entreated his <lb/>
            friend to stand by him in his present dangerous position, and <lb/>
            to conceal him and his ass there for a short time, so that by <pb n="193"/>
            <note type="margin"> BOOK IX. </note> <lb/>
            keeping out of the way two or three days, he might escape the <lb/>
            penalty of the capital offence he had committed. This man, <lb/>
            not being forgetful of their former friendship, he readily re­ <lb/>
            ceived him, and having dragged me with my legs tied together <lb/>
            up stairs into an attic, the gardener crept into a chest that was <lb/>
            in the warehouse below, and covering himself with the lid, <lb/>
            there lay concealed.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile the soldier, as I afterwards learned, like one <lb/>
            recovering from a violent fit of intoxication, made his way <lb/>
            to the town, staggering and tottering, sore with the pain of <lb/>
            so many wounds, and with difficulty supporting himself on <lb/>
            his stick. Ashamed to mention to any of the citizens the parti­ <lb/>
            culars of his own violence and his ignominious defeat, he <lb/>
            silently digested the affront he had received, until meeting at <lb/>
            last with some of his fellow-soldiers, he told them of his mis­ <lb/>
            fortune. They were of opinion, that he should conceal him­ <lb/>
            self for some time in the barracks; (for, besides the disgrace <lb/>
            to himself, he feared also the military oath sworn by the <lb/>
            Genius,* on account of the loss of his sword), while they, <lb/>
            noting down the description he gave of us, would make the <lb/>
            most zealous endeavours for our discovery, and the gratification <lb/>
            of their own vengeance. Nor was a perfidious neighbour want­ <lb/>
            ing to tell them very speedily where we were concealed.</p>
          <p>Thereupon, the soldier's comrades applied to the magis­ <lb/>
            trates, and falsely assorted that they had lost on the road a <lb/>
            silver cup of considerable value, that belonged to their com­ <lb/>
            manding officer, and that a certain gardener had found it, and <lb/>
            would not give it up, but was now lying concealed in the <lb/>
            house of a friend. The magistrates, on being made acquainted <lb/>
            with the loss, and the name of the commanding officer, came <lb/>
            to the door of our dwelling, and with a loud voice, gave notice <lb/>
            to our host that it would be better for him to deliver us up, <lb/>
            whowere beyond a doubt concealed in his premises, than to <lb/>
            render himself liable to capital punishment. But our friend, <lb/>
            not being in the least daunted, and resolute to save the guest <note type="footnote"> * Military oath sworn by the Genius.]—i. e. The Genius of the emperor, <lb/>
            by whom the Roman soldiers solemnly swore never to desert, &amp;c. This <lb/>
            oath they deemed more sacred, as Tertullian remarks, than if they had <lb/>
            sworn by all the gods put together. The loss of the sword, the buckler, <lb/>
            or any other of their principal accoutrements, was punished as equivalent <lb/>
            to desertion. </note> <note type="footnote"> O </note> <lb/>

            he had taken under his protection, declared that he knew no­ <lb/>
            thing about us, and that he had not seen that gardener for <lb/>
            several days. On the other hand, the soldiers, swearing by <lb/>
            the Genius of the emperor, maintained that he was concealed <lb/>
            there, and nowhere else.</p>
          <p>At length the magistrates were determined, by making a <lb/>
            strict search, to confute him in this his obstinate denial. Ac­ <lb/>
            cordingly, sending the lictors and other public officers into the <lb/>
            Bouse, they ordered them carefully to search every hole and <lb/>
            corner. But, after all their search, the officers reported that <lb/>
            no human being, nor yet any ass, was to be found within the <lb/>
            threshold. The dispute now grew very warm on both sides; <lb/>
            the soldiers swore by Cæsar that they knew for certain we were <lb/>
            there, while the master of the house swore as stoutly by all <lb/>
            the gods in denial of the assertion. On hearing this conten­ <lb/>
            tion and clamour, I, who was in general an ass of an inqui­ <lb/>
            sitive and restless disposition, stretched my neck out of a little <lb/>
            window, and tried to see what all the noise was about; but <lb/>
            one of the soldiers, by chance turning his eyes in the direction <lb/>
            of my shadow, instantly called out to all of them to observe it; <lb/>
            whereupon they instantly raised a loud shout, and rushing up <lb/>
            the steps, some of them seized hold of me, and led me prisoner <lb/>
            from my place of concealment. And now, without more de­ <lb/>
            lay, they narrowly examined every corner, and opening the <lb/>
            chest, they found the wretched gardener, dragged him out, and <lb/>
            carried him before the magistrates, and finally to the public <lb/>
            gaol, in order that he might suffer capital punishment. Nor <lb/>
            -could they ever have done joking and laughing at the notion <lb/>
            of my looking out of the window. From this circumstance, <lb/>
            also, the well-known proverb originated, about the peeping <lb/>
            ass and his shadow.* <note type="footnote"> * Peeping ass and his shadow.]—This proverb, which Apuleius jocu- <lb/>
            lady says originated from the above-mentioned circumstance, is of much <lb/>
            greater antiquity. Lucian has only <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐξὀνου̃παρακυψεὼς</foreign>,from the peep­ <lb/>
            ing of an ass. There is also another Greek proverb, mentioned by Me­ <lb/>
            nander, Plato, and many others, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὺπερὀνου̃σκιὰς</foreign>,concerning the shadow <lb/>
            of an ass, which is said of those who are anxious to know things futile, <lb/>
            frivolous, and entirely useless. These two proverbs Apuleius has mingled <lb/>
            into one. </note> <pb n="195"/>

          <p>WHAT became of my master, the gardener, on the following <lb/>
            day, I know not. But the soldier, who had been so hand­ <lb/>
            somely thrashed for his overbearing conduct, untied me from <lb/>
            my manger and took me away, there being no one to hinder <lb/>
            him. Then going to his barracks, as it appeared to me, he led <lb/>
            me into the public road, laden with his baggage, and equipped <lb/>
            quite in military style. For he put on my back a glittering <lb/>
            helmet, of remarkable brightness, a shield still more splendid, <lb/>
            and a long gleaming lance. The latter he took care to place <lb/>
            conspicuously on the top of the pole, which he had arranged in <lb/>
            the form of a trophy, not so much in compliance with the regu­ <lb/>
            lations, as for the purpose of terrifying unfortunate travellers. <lb/>
            Having passed over a level country by an easy road, we came to <lb/>
            a little town, but we did not put up at an inn, but at the house <lb/>
            of a certain decurion. After having delivered me to the care <lb/>
            of a servant, the soldier repaired without delay to the presence <lb/>
            of his officer, who had the command of a thousand men.</p>
          <p>I remember that a few days after our arrival, a most wicked <lb/>
            and dreadful crime was perpetrated in that town. I will re­ <lb/>

          <p>THE master of the house had a son, a young man of great <lb/>
            literary attainments, and consequently remarkable for his piety <lb/>
            and modesty; so that any one would have wished to have <lb/>
            just such a son. The mother of this young man having been <lb/>
            dead many years, his father contracted a second marriage, and <lb/>
            his second wife had borne him another son, who had now just <lb/>
            passed his twelfth year. But the stepmother, who held <lb/>
            supreme sway in her husband's house, rather in consequence <lb/>
            of her good looks than her good morals, regarded her stepson <lb/>
            with lustful eyes, whether it was that she was naturally vici­ <lb/>
            ous, or was impelled by Fate to such extreme criminality. <lb/>
            Know, therefore, excellent reader, that you are about to peruse <lb/>
            a tragic, and not a comic tale, and that you will have to ascend <lb/>
            from the sock* to the buskin.</p>
          <p>Now as long as the little Cupid was in its infancy, this <lb/>
            woman easily repressed her rising blushes, and concealed them <lb/>
            in silence. But when love, raging without control, wrapped <lb/>
            her whole soul in flame, she then succumbed to the cruel God; <lb/>
            and, feigning illness, concealed the disease of the mind under <lb/>
            the pretence of bodily ailment. Now every one knows that <lb/>
            all the morbid changes in the bodily condition and appearance <lb/>
            are quite alike in those who are sick and those who are in <lb/>
            love; such, for instance, as an unsightly paleness, languor of <lb/>
            the eyes, restless sleep, and sighs the more deep from the <lb/>
            slowness of the torment. You might have supposed that she <lb/>
            was only afflicted by fitful attacks of fever, had it not been <lb/>
            that she wept. Alas! for the unskilful impressions of her <lb/>
            doctors! what meant the hurried pulse, the sudden flush, the <lb/>
            oppressed respiration, the frequent tossings and turnings from <lb/>
            side to side. Good Gods! how easy is it even for one who is <lb/>
            no doctor, but is acquainted with the symptoms of love and <lb/>
            passion, to comprehend the true nature of the case, when he <lb/>
            sees a person burning without bodily heat ?</p>
          <p>Unable any longer to control her raging passion, she at length <lb/>
            broke her long silence, and sent for her son to be called to her, <lb/>
            a name she wished he had never borne or might bear no more, <note type="footnote"> * The sock, &amp;c.]—i. e. From comedy to tragedy; the sock was worn by <lb/>
            actors in comedy, the buskin in tragedy. </note> <pb n="197"/>
            <note type="margin"> BOOK X. </note> <lb/>
            that she might not, by using it, be reminded of her shame. <lb/>
            The young man obeyed without delay the command of his <lb/>
            love-sick parent, and with a forehead wrinkled with sorrow, <lb/>
            like that of an old man, he went into the chamber of her who <lb/>
            was the wife of his father and the mother of his brother, pay­ <lb/>
            ing that obedience to her which, to a certain degree, was her due. <lb/>
            As for her, fast aground, as it were, upon the shoals of doubt, <lb/>
            and long unable to break a silence that tortured her, she again <lb/>
            rejects every word which she had at first conceived to be most <lb/>
            adapted to the present interview, and even still in a state of <lb/>
            indecision, through shame, she cannot tell how to begin. The <lb/>
            young man, however, suspecting nothing wrong, with a down­ <lb/>
            cast countenance, spontaneously asked her what was the cause <lb/>
            of her present malady. Upon this, availing herself of the per­ <lb/>
            nicious opportunity afforded her, she took courage to falter out <lb/>
            these few words, while she wept profusely, and hid her face <lb/>
            with her garment:</p>
          <p>"You yourself are the sole cause and origin of my malady, <lb/>
            and you are the remedy too, and the only chance of life now <lb/>
            left me. For those eyes of yours, penetrating through my own <lb/>
            into the inmost core of my heart, have kindled there a most <lb/>
            vehement fire. Take pity, therefore, on me, who am perish­ <lb/>
            ing for your sake; and let no scruples on your father's ac­ <lb/>
            count have the least weight with you, for, by complying with <lb/>
            my wishes, you will preserve for him a wife, who is otherwise <lb/>
            doomed to die. It is with reason that I love you, since in <lb/>
            your face I recognize his features. We are alone; you have <lb/>
            nothing to fear; you have full opportunity for this act, so ne­ <lb/>
            cessary to my existence-a thing that no one knows."</p>
          <p>The young man being in utter confusion at this unexpected <lb/>
            misfortune, although he recoiled from the mere thought of such <lb/>
            an abominable deed, yet did not think it right to exasperate <lb/>
            her by too abrupt a refusal of a denial, but rather that he ought <lb/>
            to appease her by a delusive promise. He promised, therefore, <lb/>
            without reserve, and earnestly persuaded her to keep up her <lb/>
            spirits, restore her strength by nutriment, and pay attention to <lb/>
            her health, till his father should go on some journey or other, <lb/>
            and leave them free to enjoy their pleasures. He then with­ <lb/>
            drew from the baneful presence of his stepmother, and con­ <lb/>
            ceiving likewise that this calamity with which his house was <lb/>
            threatened called for the deepest consideration, he immediately <lb/>
             <pb n="198"/>
            related the affair to an aged mail of well-tried prudence, who <lb/>
            had been his tutor. After long deliberation, nothing seemed <lb/>
            to be so advisable as to escape this storm, let loose by adverse <lb/>
            fortune, by instant flight.</p>
          <p>The woman, however, impatient at even the smallest delay, <lb/>
            invented some pretext or other, and found means cunningly to <lb/>
            persuade her husband to take a journey, with all speed, to <lb/>
            some small farms of his, which were situate at a very con­ <lb/>
            siderable distance. This being done, in a state of frantic eager­ <lb/>
            ness for the fulfilment of her hopes, she solicited her stepson <lb/>
            to perform his promise. The young man, however, now pre­ <lb/>
            tending this thing, now that, as an excuse, avoids her execrable <lb/>
            presence, till at last, clearly perceiving, from the varying na­ <lb/>
            ture of his messages, that he refused to fulfil his promise, <lb/>
            her nefarious love became suddenly changed into hatred far <lb/>
            more intense. Immediately summoning a most villanous <lb/>
            slave of hers, who had formed a portion of the dowry she <lb/>
            brought her husband, and who was ready for the perpetration <lb/>
            of any crime, she communicated to him her perfidious designs, <lb/>
            and there was no course that seemed to them preferable to de­ <lb/>
            priving the unfortunate youth of life. Accordingly, this vil­ <lb/>
            lain was sent immediately to buy a poison of the most deadly <lb/>
            quality, and, having carefully mixed it in wine, she prepared <lb/>
            it for the destruction of her guiltless son-in-law.</p>
          <p>As it so happened, while the wicked pair were deliberating <lb/>
            about a suitable opportunity for giving him the poison, the <lb/>
            younger boy, this most abandoned woman's own son, returning <lb/>
            home after his morning studies, and feeling thirsty from his <lb/>
            breakfast, found the cup of wine which contained the poison,. <lb/>
            and swallowed at a draught the contents; but no sooner had he <lb/>
            drunk the deadly potion which had been prepared for his bro­ <lb/>
            ther, than he fell lifeless on the ground. His tutor, horrified <lb/>
            at his sudden death, alarmed the mother and the whole family <lb/>
            with his cries. And now, when the cause was ascertained to <lb/>
            have been the noxious draught, opinions varied as to who were <lb/>
            the authors of the crime. But this wicked woman, a singular <lb/>
            specimen of a stepmother's malice, not at all moved by the <lb/>
            shocking death of her son, nor by the consciousness of having <lb/>
            murdered him, nor by the misfortune of her house, nor by the <lb/>
            grief her husband would feel for the loss of his son, seized <lb/>
            upon the destruction of her own offspring as a ready means of <pb n="199"/>
            <note type="margin"> BOOK X. </note> <lb/>
            vengeance. She immediately sent a messenger to inform her <lb/>
            husband, who was on his journey, of the calamity which had <lb/>
            befallen his house; and when he returned home with all pos­ <lb/>
            sible haste, she, with enormous effrontery, pretended that her <lb/>
            son had been destroyed by poison, administered to him by her <lb/>
            stepson. And in this she did not altogether speak falsely, <lb/>
            because the boy really had met with the death which had been <lb/>
            intended for the young man. She, however, pretended that <lb/>
            the younger brother had been put an end to through the wicked­ <lb/>
            ness of her stepson, because she would not comply with the <lb/>
            licentious proposals the latter had made to her. Nor was she <lb/>
            contented with lies of such enormity, but even added, that he <lb/>
            had likewise threatened her with a sword, in consequence of <lb/>
            her detection of his wickedness.</p>
          <p>Grievously was the unhappy man afflicted at the death of <lb/>
            both his sons; for he saw his younger son buried before his <lb/>
            face, and he knew that his other son would certainly be con­ <lb/>
            demned to death for incest and fratricide; and then, besides, <lb/>
            he was impelled to extreme hatred of this son by the feigned <lb/>
            lamentations of a wife whom he held too dear. No sooner, <lb/>
            therefore, had the funeral rites of the unfortunate boy been <lb/>
            arranged, than the unhappy old man hastened straight from <lb/>
            the pile to the forum, with the tears still wet upon his cheeks, <lb/>
            and tearing his white hairs, begrimed with ashes ; and there, <lb/>
            giving loose to his passionate feelings, he used every endeavour <lb/>
            to- procure the destruction of his remaining son, by tears and <lb/>
            by. entreaties, even embracing the very knees of the decu­ <lb/>
            rions; and never imagining the treachery of his most infam­ <lb/>
            ous wife, he exclaimed that his son was an incestuous wretch, <lb/>
            who had attempted to violate his father's bed; that he was a <lb/>
            fratricide, and had threatened to kill his stepmother. In fine, <lb/>
            by his lamentations, he aroused not only the senate but the <lb/>
            people, to such a degree of pity and indignation, that, impatient <lb/>
            of the tedious formality of a judicial process, and waiving in- <lb/>
            contep.table proofs in support of the accusation, and the studied <lb/>
            subterfuges of pleaders, they shouted out with one consent, <lb/>
            that a public crime ought to be punished by the public, and <lb/>
            that the author of it ought to be stoned to death. In the <lb/>
            meantime, the magistrates, apprehensive, on their own account, <lb/>
            lest the growing excitement should lead to results destructive of <lb/>
            all order and of the civic weal, began, partly by expostulating <lb/>
             <pb n="200"/>
            with the decurions, and partly by soothing the feelings of the <lb/>
            public, to induce them that the trial might proceed in due <lb/>
            order, and in conformity with the customs of their ancestors, <lb/>
            the allegations on both sides being duly weighed, and the sen­ <lb/>
            tence pronounced in a legal manner. They added, that no one <lb/>
            ought to be condemned without a hearing, after the manner of <lb/>
            fierce barbarians or lawless tyrants, since, by so doing, they <lb/>
            would leave, in those times of profound peace, a dreadful pre­ <lb/>
            cedent for posterity.</p>
          <p>This sound advice prevailed; and immediately the crier <lb/>
            proclaimed aloud that the senators were to assemble in the <lb/>
            senate-house. These having immediately taken their accus­ <lb/>
            tomed places, according to their rank and dignity, the crier <lb/>
            again made proclamation aloud, and the accuser first came <lb/>
            forward; then the prisoner was called and brought into <lb/>
            court, and, lastly, the crier, in conformity with the law of <lb/>
            Athens and the process of the Areopagus, announced to the <lb/>
            advocates on both sides that they were to plead without pre­ <lb/>
            amble, and to avoid all appeals for the purpose of exciting com­ <lb/>
            miseration. That this was the manner of proceeding I learned <lb/>
            from overhearing the remarks of many people, as they were <lb/>
            talking with one another. But as I was not present at the <lb/>
            trial, but tied up to a manger, I shall only commit here to <lb/>
            writing what I ascertained to be exactly the truth.</p>
          <p>As soon as the harangues of the orators were concluded, the <lb/>
            senators determined that the truth of the charges should be <lb/>
            established by certain proofs, and that a question of such great <lb/>
            consequence should not be left to suspicion and conjecture. <lb/>
            They, likewise, thought it requisite that the servant, who was <lb/>
            said to be the only person who knew the facts of the case, <lb/>
            should be brought forward. Nor was that candidate for the <lb/>
            gallows in the least dismayed, either by the doubtful result of <lb/>
            so serious an investigation, or by the view of the thronged <lb/>
            senate house, or even by his own guilty conscience, but began <lb/>
            to state and affirm as true a number of things which he him­ <lb/>
            self had invented. He said, that the young man, being indig­ <lb/>
            nant at the repulse received from his step-mother, had sum­ <lb/>
            moned him; that, in order to avenge the affront, he had or­ <lb/>
            dered him to destroy her son; that he had promised him a <lb/>
            great reward to ensure his secrecy ; that on his refusal to do <lb/>
            what he wished, he had threatened to put him to death ; that <pb n="201"/>
            <note type="margin"> BOOK X. </note> <lb/>
            he had delivered to him the poison mixed with his own hand, <lb/>
            to be given to his brother; and that the young man, suspecting <lb/>
            he had forborne to administer the potion, and had reserved it, <lb/>
            to produce as evidence of the crime, at last gave it to the boy <lb/>
            with his own hand."</p>
          <p>When this villanous knave had, with an affected agitation, <lb/>
            uttered these egregious lies, which bore a most plausible re­ <lb/>
            semblance to truth, the trial was brought to a conclusion, and <lb/>
            not one was there among the senators so favourably disposed <lb/>
            towards the young man, as not to pronounce him clearly guilty, <lb/>
            and condemn him to be sewed up in the leathern sack. The <lb/>
            verdicts, in which they all agreed, were about to be com­ <lb/>
            mitted to writing, according to custom, and to be placed in <lb/>
            the brazen urn; after which, the die being cast, no change <lb/>
            could lawfully be made, but the life of the criminal was placed <lb/>
            in the hands of the executioner. Just then, an aged physician, <lb/>
            a member of the senate, and a person of approved integrity, <lb/>
            and of remarkable influence, covering with his hand the mouth <lb/>
            of the urn, that no one might rashly put his billet into it, thus <lb/>
            addressed the court:</p>
          <p>“I rejoice that, long as I have lived, I have ever enjoyed <lb/>
            your approbation; and I will not suffer a manifest act of homi­ <lb/>
            cide to be perpetrated, by condemning a man to death on a <lb/>
            false accusation; nor you to violate your oath, as judges, for <lb/>
            the lying testimony of a slave. I myself will not cheat my <lb/>
            own conscience, and trample on the reverence which is due to <lb/>
            the gods, by pronouncing an unjust sentence. Learn, there­ <lb/>
            fore, from me, the real circumstances of the case. This vil­ <lb/>
            lanous fellow came to me some time ago, and offered me a <lb/>
            hundred golden solidi for a prompt and deadly poison, telling <lb/>
            me he wanted it for a person who, being grievously afflicted <lb/>
            with an incurable disease, wished to rid himself from the tor­ <lb/>
            ment of life. Noticing the confusion and incoherence of the <lb/>
            rascal's story, and feeling sure that he was about to perpetrate <lb/>
            some crime, I certainly gave him the potion, but as a precaution, <lb/>
            in case the affair should be looked into at some future time, I <lb/>
            did not immediately take the money that was agreed upon, <lb/>
            but said to him, ' Lest by chance any of these golden coins <lb/>
            which you offer me should be found to be light or spurious, <lb/>
            put them in this bag, and seal it with your own seal, till they <lb/>
            are to-morrow examined in the presence of a money-changer.' <lb/>
             <pb n="202"/>
            lIe complied, and sealed up the money; as soon, therefore, <lb/>
            as he was brought into court to give evidence, I ordered one <lb/>
            of my servants to go with all haste and fetch the bag from my <lb/>
            shop, and here I now produce it before you. Let him look at <lb/>
            it, and examine the impression of his own seal. Now how can <lb/>
            the brother be accused of having procured the poison which <lb/>
            this fellow bought ?"</p>
          <p>On the instant, a violent fit of trembling seized the villain; <lb/>
            his natural hue gave place to a deadly paleness; and a cold <lb/>
            perspiration suffused all his limbs. He began to shift about <lb/>
            his feet with irregular movements; to scratch now this, now <lb/>
            that side of his head; and, with his mouth half open, stam­ <lb/>
            mering and stuttering, to utter I know not what silly nonsense, <lb/>
            insomuch that not a single person could reasonably suppose <lb/>
            him to be innocent of the crime. Recovering, however, his <lb/>
            craftiness once again, he unceasingly denied the charge, and <lb/>
            accused the physician of lying. On this, the physician, inde­ <lb/>
            pendently of his being bound by oath to give a just judgment, <lb/>
            when he saw that his honour was openly impeached, made <lb/>
            redoubled efforts to confute this villain; till at last the public <lb/>
            officers, by order of the magistrates, seizing the slave's hand, <lb/>
            found the iron ring, and compared it with the impression on <lb/>
            the bag. As the result corroborated the suspicion previously <lb/>
            entertained, the rack and the wooden horse were put in opera­ <lb/>
            tion, according to the Greek custom. Being upheld, however, <lb/>
            by a wonderful amount of boldness, he was proof against all <lb/>
            blows, and even fire itself.</p>
          <p>At last, the physician exclaimed, " I will not suffer, by <lb/>
            Hercules ! I will not suffer, either that this innocent young <lb/>
            man shall receive a punishment at your hands contrary to jus­ <lb/>
            tice, or that this fellow shall stultify our judgment and escape <lb/>
            the punishment due to his crimes. I will give you an evident <lb/>
            proof on this matter under consideration. When this most <lb/>
            abandoned man was anxious to obtain the deadly poison, I was <lb/>
            of opinion that it ill accorded with my art to furnish any one <lb/>
            with the means of producing death, being sensible that medi­ <lb/>
            cine was sought not for the destruction, but for the preservation <lb/>
            of mankind; yet I feared that if I should refuse to give it him, <lb/>
            I should thereby prompt him to another method of perpetrating <lb/>
            the crime, and that he would accomplish the criminal purpose <lb/>
            upon which he had resolved, either by buying a deadly potion <pb n="203"/>
            <note type="margin"> BOOK X. </note> <lb/>
            from some other person, or, at all events, by the sword, or some <lb/>
            such weapon ; fearing this, I gave him indeed a drug, but it <lb/>
            was a preparation of the soporiferous plant called mandrake, <lb/>
            remarkable for the torpor which it is known to occasion, and <lb/>
            which produces a sleep exactly resembling death. Nor is it <lb/>
            to be wondered at, that this most desperate knave, being cer­ <lb/>
            tain of undergoing, if convicted, the utmost penalty that can <lb/>
            be inflicted on him, conformably to the customs of our ances­ <lb/>
            tors, should be ready to endure these tortures, as being lighter <lb/>
            evils. But if the boy has really taken the potion which was <lb/>
            mixed by my hands, he is still alive, in a torpid state, and <lb/>
            asleep : and immediately his drowsy slumbers are shaken off, <lb/>
            he will return to the light of day. But if he is really dead, <lb/>
            you may look for some other way of accounting for his de­ <lb/>
            cease."</p>
          <p>The old man having addressed them to this effect, they as­ <lb/>
            sented to what he said; and immediately proceeded in great <lb/>
            haste to the pile on which the body of the boy was laid. Not <lb/>
            a member was there of the senate, nor a person of the first <lb/>
            rank, who did not run thither, impelled by curiosity. And <lb/>
            behold, the father himself, having with his own hands removed <lb/>
            the lid of the coffin, found his son rising that moment from <lb/>
            the dead, the deathlike sleep shaken off; and most ardently <lb/>
            embracing him, and unable in words to express his present joy, <lb/>
            he led him forth into the presence of the people, and the boy <lb/>
            was brought into court, just as he was, swathed and bound in <lb/>
            the grave-clothes.</p>
          <p>And now the naked truth was obvious to every one, the <lb/>
            wickedness of the nefarious slave, and of the still more aban­ <lb/>
            doned woman, being clearly exposed. Accordingly, the step- <lb/>
            mother was condemned to perpetual banishment, the slave was <lb/>
            crucified; and by the consent of all, the golden solidi were <lb/>
            presented to the worthy physician, as a reward for the trance <lb/>
            he had produced with such happy results. Thus did the sin­ <lb/>
            gular and romantic fortune of the old decurion come to a <lb/>
            termination worthy of Divine providence; since, in a passing <lb/>
            moment, indeed an instant of time, he suddenly became the <lb/>
            father of two young men. after he had been in danger of losing <lb/>
            both.</p>
          <p>END OF THE THIRTEENTH EPISODE.</p><pb n="204"/>
            
          <p>As for myself, you shall hear what changes of fortune I <lb/>
            experienced at that time.</p>
          <p>The soldier who had made me his own without paying for me, <lb/>
            being about to carry letters to the great prince at Rome, in <lb/>
            obedience to the commands of his tribune, sold me for eleven <lb/>
            denars to two brothers, servants of a very wealthy personage in <lb/>
            the neighbourhood. One of them was a confectioner, who made <lb/>
            bread and sweetmeats; the other was a cook, and dressed rich <lb/>
            stews seasoned with the relishing juices of pounded herbs and <lb/>
            aromatics. These two, dwelling together and living in common, <lb/>
            bought me for the purpose of carrying the numerous vessels <lb/>
            which were required for their master's use, when he was tra­ <lb/>
            velling through different countries. I was admitted, there­ <lb/>
            fore, as a third companion with these two brothers; and never, <lb/>
            at any time, during my transformation, did I experience a <lb/>
            fortune so marked with good luck. For, in the evening, after <lb/>
            the supper, which was always on a magnificent scale, my <lb/>
            masters were in the habit of bringing home to their little <lb/>
            room numerous fragments that were left; the one brought <lb/>
            ample remains of roast pig, chickens, fish, and delicate dishes <lb/>
            of that kind; while the other brought bread, pastry, sugar­ <lb/>
            plums, hook cakes, lizard cakes, and many kinds of honied <lb/>
            sweetmeats. Accordingly, after they had fastened the door <lb/>
            of their chamber, and had gone to the baths for the pur­ <lb/>
            pose of refreshing themselves, I used to cram myself with the <lb/>
            dainties that fell in my way through the favour of the Gods. <lb/>
            For I was not so much a fool, nor so truly an ass, as to neglect <lb/>
            this most delicious fare, and feed upon coarse hay. My thie­ <lb/>
            vish manoeuvres for a long time succeeded most beautifully, <lb/>
            because, as yet, I pilfered cautiously and sparingly, only a few <lb/>
            articles out of a great number, and they had no suspicion of <lb/>
            such tricks being played by an ass. But when, becoming still <lb/>
            more fearless of detection, I devoured all the nicest bits, and, <lb/>
            rejecting all that was stale, began to lick up the more choice <lb/>
            morsels, the brothers were not a little surprized and per­ <lb/>
            plexed. And though even then they did not believe such a <lb/>
            thing of me, still they made diligent enquiry as to who was <lb/>
            the author of their daily losses. At length, indeed, they even <lb/>
            went so far as to accuse each other of this most base act of <lb/>
            theft; and they began to keep sharper watch, and to count all <lb/>
            they put by.</p><pb n="205"/>
            
          <p><note type="margin">BOOK X. </note> At length, throwing off all hesitation and reserve, one of <lb/>
            them thus addressed the other: "Why, really now, this is <lb/>
            neither fair nor like a man, for you every day to be diminish­ <lb/>
            ing what has been put by, and to be purloining the choicest <lb/>
            parts, and then to go and sell them, so as silly to increase your <lb/>
            own stock, and then cry halves of the remainder. If, in fact, <lb/>
            you are tired of our partnership, we may still live as brothers <lb/>
            in all other respects, and yet give up this partnership concern of <lb/>
            ours. For I see that when dissatisfaction at the loss has in­ <lb/>
            creased to a very considerable extent, it will create very great <lb/>
            discord between us."</p>
          <p>To this the other rejoined, “I do, by Hercules! admire this <lb/>
            effrontery of yours, after you have secretly been pilfering the <lb/>
            articles, to forestall my complaints, which, in silence and <lb/>
            sorrow, I have kept to myself, being determined to put up <lb/>
            with it as long as ever I could, rather than accuse my biothei <lb/>
            of shabby theft. But it is well, that having spoken upon the <lb/>
            matter on both sides, we are put upon seeking a remedy for <lb/>
            our loss, lest our misunderstanding, gathering strength by si­ <lb/>
            lence, should produce between us a strife like that of Eteocles <lb/>
            and his brother."</p>
          <p>Bandying these and similar reproaches against one another, <lb/>
            they both of them solemnly declared that they had been guilty <lb/>
            of no fraud whatever, nor of the slightest purloining; but <lb/>
            agreed, that they ought by every possible contrivance try to <lb/>
            discover the thief who was the author of their common loss. <lb/>
            It was not possible, they said, that the ass, which was the <lb/>
            only being there, could take a fancy to such kind of food: and <lb/>
            still, every day the choicest portions were nowhere to be found ; <lb/>
            and certainly no flies found their way into their room, that <lb/>
            were as large as were the harpies of old, who robbed Phineas <lb/>
            of his dainties.</p>
          <p>In the meantime, I, being bountifully crammed with dainty <lb/>
            morsels, and well stuffed with human food, found my body <lb/>
            plumped up, my hide softened with rich juices, and my coat <lb/>
            grown sleek and shining. But that same comeliness was the <lb/>
            cause of a great shock to my feelings. For being roused to <lb/>
            suspicion by the uncommon breadth of my back, and perceiv­ <lb/>
            ing that my hay remained every day quite untouched, they <lb/>
            now directed all their attention to me. Accordingly, having <lb/>
            shut the door at the accustomed hour as usual, as though they <lb/>
             <pb n="206"/>
            were going to the bath, they peeped at me through a little <lb/>
            crevice, as I was intent upon eating the fragments which were <lb/>
            exposed in various directions. And now, forgetting all con­ <lb/>
            sideration for their loss, they burst into a violent fit of laughter <lb/>
            at the monstrous epicurism of an ass ; and then calling toge­ <lb/>
            ther a number of their fellow-servants, they pointed out to <lb/>
            them the incredible appetite of an animal like me. Then <lb/>
            laughter so loud and so continued seized them all, that the <lb/>
            master, who happened to be passing by, asked what fun was <lb/>
            going on to make his servants laugh so excessively. Being <lb/>
            told what it was, he came himself and peeped through the <lb/>
            same cranny. Then he too laughed until his stomach ached, <lb/>
            and opening the door of the room, he came nearer to me, and <lb/>
            observed me very attentively. But as for me, seeing that for­ <lb/>
            tune was inclined to smile more propitiously upon me, I went <lb/>
            on eating quite at my ease, the merriment of those present in­ <lb/>
            spiring me with additional confidence; till at last the master <lb/>
            of the house, enchanted by the novelty of the sight, ordered me <lb/>
            to be led to the supper-room; or rather he led me to it with <lb/>
            his own hands; and the table being laid, he directed every <lb/>
            kind of substantial food to be placed before me, and dishes <lb/>
            that had not been tasted. Now, though I was well stuffed <lb/>
            already, yet desiring to render myself more agreeable, and <lb/>
            more pleasing to 'him, I ate of the food placed before me as if <lb/>
            I had been quite hungry. But they, prompted by extreme <lb/>
            curiosity, thinking of every thing which an ass would be most <lb/>
            likely to loathe, offered it to me, for the purpose of testing my <lb/>
            politeness; such as meat seasoned with assafœtida, fowls <lb/>
            sprinkled over with pepper, and fish soused in foreign pickle. <lb/>
            In the meantime, the banquet room resounded with roars of <lb/>
            laughter.</p>
          <p>At last, a bit of a buffoon who was present, said, " Give a <lb/>
            little wine to our comrade." " Well said, rogue," cried the <lb/>
            master ; “I dare say our friend would have no objection to a <lb/>
            cup of honied wine." " Here, lad," said he, “ wash well that <lb/>
            golden cup, fill it with honied wine, and offer it to my guest; <lb/>
            and at the same time, tell him that I have drunk his good <lb/>
            health." All the guests now awaited the result in a state of <lb/>
            intense curiosity; the huge cup was handed to me, and wither <lb/>
            more ado, I emptied it at a single draught quite deliberately, and <lb/>
            with a very jovial air, screwing up the extremities of my lips, <pb n="207"/>
            <note type="margin"> BOOK X. </note> <lb/>
            in resemblance of a tongue. Then a shout of applause arose, <lb/>
            and all, with one accord, drank my health.</p>
          <p>In the end, the master, being excessively pleased, after <lb/>
            calling the servants who had bought me, ordered that four <lb/>
            times the price they had paid for me should be given to them; <lb/>
            thereupon he delivered me into the charge of a certain person, <lb/>
            a freedman of his, to whom he was much attached, and who <lb/>
            was very well off, and desired him to take all possible care of <lb/>
            me. This person treated me in a very humane and kind <lb/>
            manner; and that he might still more deserve the esteem of <lb/>
            his patron, most studiously consulted his amusement by <lb/>
            teaching me clever tricks. In the first place, he taught me to <lb/>
            recline at table, leaning on my elbow; next, to wrestle and to <lb/>
            dance even, raising my fore feet; and-a thing that won especial <lb/>
            admiration-to use signs instead of words, so as to indicate <lb/>
            what I disapproved of by throwing back, and what I approved <lb/>
            of by bowing my head. He also taught me, when I was <lb/>
            thirsty, to look towards the cup-bearer, and by winking first <lb/>
            one eyelid then another, to show that I wanted something to <lb/>
            drink. In all these matters I showed myself very ready and <lb/>
            obedient; as I could have done them all, though no one had <lb/>
            shown me how. But I was afraid, lest, if I should happen to <lb/>
            perform them, in imitation of human beings, without the aid <lb/>
            of a master, most people would think that it portended sinister <lb/>
            events, and that I, as a monster and prodigy, might have to <lb/>
            part with my head, and be given as fat provender to the <lb/>
            vultures.</p>
          <p>And now my renown was spread abroad in all directions, so <lb/>
            that I rendered my master quite famous and illustrious, in con­ <lb/>
            sequence of my wonderful accomplishments. “This," said <lb/>
            the people, " is the man who has an ass for his guest and com­ <lb/>
            panion ; an ass that wrestles, an ass that dances, and under­ <lb/>
            stands the language of men, and expresses what he means by <lb/>
            signs." It is proper, however, that I should now, at all <lb/>
            events, inform you, though I ought to have done so in the be­ <lb/>
            ginning, who this Thyasus was, and whence he came; for <lb/>
            such was the name of my master. The country which gave <lb/>
            him birth was Corinth, a city which ranks as the chief of all <lb/>
            the province of Achaia. And, as he had gradually attained <lb/>
            all the honours which his pedigree and dignity demanded, he <lb/>
            had now been nominated to the office of quinquennial magis­ <lb/>
             <pb n="208"/>
            trate. Accordingly, in order that he might act conformably <lb/>
            to the splendour of that office, he had promised to exhibit a <lb/>
            show of gladiators for the space of three days; thus extending <lb/>
            his liberality to the greatest possible degree. In fact, it was <lb/>
            his desire of receiving the public applause that had now <lb/>
            brought him to Thessaly, in order to procure from thence the <lb/>
            most noble wild beasts and some celebrated gladiators.</p>
          <p>And now, having made all his arrangements and completed <lb/>
            all his purchases quite to his satisfaction, he was preparing to <lb/>
            return home. Disdaining, however, his own splendid chariots, <lb/>
            which, some covered and some open, were drawn along in the <lb/>
            . rear of the cavalcade; regardless also of his Thessalian horses, <lb/>
            and his other beasts of Gallic breed, whose generous pedigree <lb/>
            bore testimony to their rarity and value; despising and neglect­ <lb/>
            ing all these, he rode most lovingly on me, who was decked out <lb/>
            with golden trappings, a coloured saddle, purple cloths, a silver <lb/>
            bit, an embroidered girth, and some little bells that tinkled as <lb/>
            I went along, and sometimes he addressed me in the kindest <lb/>
            of words. Among-many other expressions too which he made <lb/>
            use of, he declared how extremely delighted he was at pos­ <lb/>
            sessing in me, at one and the same time, a companion and a <lb/>
            bearer.</p>
          <p>And now, having finished our journey, partly by land and <lb/>
            partly by sea, we arrived at Corinth, where vast numbers of <lb/>
            the citizens came out to meet us, not so much as it seemed to <lb/>
            me for the purpose of doing honour to Thyasus, as from a <lb/>
            desire of seeing me. For so great a rumour had pervaded that <lb/>
            city about me, that I was a source of no small emolument to <lb/>
            my keeper. For perceiving that many were eagerly desirous <lb/>
            to see my pastimes, he had the doors shut, and admitted them <lb/>
            one by one, charging each a good price for admission. By <lb/>
            this means he managed every day to pick up no small sums.</p>
          <p>Among the number of spectators, there was a lady of rank <lb/>
            and fortune, who having purchased a sight of me, was quite <lb/>
            enchanted with my manifold tricks, and at last conceived a <lb/>
            wonderful desire of being more intimate with me. In short, <lb/>
            her passion grew to such a height, that, like an asinine Pasi- <lb/>
            phäe, she prevailed on my keeper, for a considerable sum of <lb/>
            money, to let her have my company for a single night: and <lb/>
            the good-for-nothing fellow consented, regardless of all con. <lb/>
            siderations save only his own gain.</p><pb n="209"/>

          <p>And now, the laborious and wakeful night being finished, <lb/>
            the woman, to avoid being seen, withdrew from my embraces <lb/>
            before day-light, at the same time making a contract with my <lb/>
            keeper for some future night, at the same price. He was <lb/>
            willing enough to gratify her, partly for the large sum he re­ <lb/>
            ceived from her, and partly for the opportunity afforded him <lb/>
            of displaying such a novel spectacle to his lord; to whom, <lb/>
            without delay, he unfolded the whole scene of our lust. There­ <lb/>

            wife of mine could not be publicly connected with me, being <lb/>
            a person of quality, nor any other volunteer could be found for <lb/>
            the same purpose, a certain vile woman, who had been sen­ <lb/>
            tenced by the prefect to be devoured by wild beasts, was pro­ <lb/>
            cured, for a great sum of money, to have connexion with me <lb/>
            in the theatre, in the sight of all the spectators. Of this wo­ <lb/>
            man I have heard the following history:-</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">FOURTEENTH EPISODE.</title>
          </ab>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">THE JEALOUS WIFE.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>SiE had a husband, whose father, when setting out on a <lb/>
            journey, had given directions to his wife, the young man's <lb/>
            mother, whom he left in a state of pregnancy, that if she <lb/>
            brought forth an infant of the weaker sex, she should imme­ <lb/>
            diately have it put to death. Now she, having brought forth <lb/>
            a girl during her husband's absence, and being moved by the <lb/>
            natural affection of a mother, disobeyed the commands of her <lb/>
            husband, and delivered it to her neighbours to be brought up. <lb/>
            On her husband's return, she informed him that she had been <lb/>
            delivered of a daughter, who had been destroyed. When now <lb/>
            the bloom of age called for the maiden's nuptial day, as she <lb/>
            could not give her daughter a portion suitable to her parentage, <lb/>
            without the knowledge of her husband, the only way she could <pb n="211"/>
            <note type="margin"> BOOK X. </note> <lb/>
            do was to disclose the secret to her son. Besides, she was <lb/>
            very much afraid lest he, by some accident, might in the <lb/>
            ardour of youth inadvertently make some attempt on the chas­ <lb/>
            tity of his sister, who was also ignorant that he was her bro­ <lb/>
            ther.</p>
          <p>The young man, who was remarkable for his' affectionate <lb/>
            disposition, religiously obeyed the commands of his mother, <lb/>
            behaved like a good brother, and kept the family secret so <lb/>
            well, that to all appearance he entertained for his sister only <lb/>
            an ordinary degree of good will. But he undertook to perform <lb/>
            a brother's duties by receiving her into his own house, as if she <lb/>
            had been some orphan girl of the neighbourhood, who had <lb/>
            been deprived of the guardian care of her parents; and he <lb/>
            proposed to marry her, ere long, to a most dear companion of <lb/>
            his, with whom he was united by the closest ties of friend­ <lb/>
            ship, and to bestow on her most liberally a dowry at his own <lb/>
            expense.</p>
          <p>But these excellent and innocent arrangements could not <lb/>
            escape the deadly malevolence of Fortune, who caused a dire <lb/>
            jealousy to spring up in the young man's house, and drove the <lb/>
            wife to those crimes for which she was now condemned to be <lb/>
            thrown to the wild beasts. She began by suspecting the girl <lb/>
            to be a rival, who supplanted her in her husband's affections ; <lb/>
            then she hated her, and finally she resolved to put her to <lb/>
            death in the most inhuman manner.</p>
          <p>Accordingly, she had recourse to the following 'wicked <lb/>
            stratagem : having stolen her husband's ring, she went to a <lb/>
            farm of theirs in the country, and from there sent a servant, <lb/>
            who, though faithful to her, was an utter villain, and told <lb/>
            him to inform the girl that the young man had come to the <lb/>
            farm and desired to see her, adding, that she was to come <lb/>
            alone, with all possible speed. And, lest any doubt might <lb/>
            happen to arise in her mind about the propriety of coming, she <lb/>
            delivered to him the ring which she had stolen from her hus­ <lb/>
            band, to show as a token that his message was authentic. On <lb/>
            this, in compliance with the injunctions of her brother, for she <lb/>
            was the only one who knew that he was her brother, and <lb/>
            having also taken notice of his seal, which was shown to her, <lb/>
            she promptly did as she was desired. As soon, however, as, <lb/>
            through this most base stratagem, she had fallen into the snares <lb/>
            which were prepared for her, the wicked wife, goaded to mad- <note type="footnote"> P2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="212"/>
            ness by her jealous fury, stripped the girl naked, and had her <lb/>
            dogged until she was nearly dead. It was in vain that the <lb/>
            poor girl confessed the truth, which was wrung from her by <lb/>
            the lash, and declared that she was wrongfully accused; in <lb/>
            vain she cried out again and again that the young man was <lb/>
            her brother. Her sister-in-law treated her story as a false­ <lb/>
            hood, and thrusting a burning brand between her thighs, <lb/>
            made her suffer a hideous death.</p>
          <p>Immediately upon this, her brother and her husband being <lb/>
            informed of her cruel death, hastened to her, and in sore afflic­ <lb/>
            tion committed her to the tomb. Nor was the young man <lb/>
            able patiently to endure the miserable fate of his sister, by the <lb/>
            hands of her, too, by whom, least of all, it ought to have been <lb/>
            occasioned; but, being racked with grief and choler, he fell <lb/>
            into a burning fever, so that he seemed in urgent need of me­ <lb/>
            dical aid. On this his wife, who had long since forfeited her <lb/>
            claim to that title, went to a certain physician, notorious for <lb/>
            his perfidy, who, being famous for his victories in many a <lb/>
            mortal struggle, could enumerate the mighty trophies which <lb/>
            his right hand had gained. To him she immediately offered fifty <lb/>
            thousand sesterces, if he would sell her poison so efficacious as <lb/>
            to destroy in an instant, that so she might purchase the death <lb/>
            of her husband.</p>
          <p>This done, she and the physician pretended that the most <lb/>
            excellent potion which they had brought, and which the <lb/>
            learned call sacred, was necessary for mitigating pains of the <lb/>
            viscera, and carrying off the bile; but, in its stead, was sub­ <lb/>
            stituted another potion, sacred to the interests of Proserpine.* <lb/>
            And now, in the presence of the sick man's household, and <lb/>
            some of his relations and friends, the physician, with his own <lb/>
            hand, after having well stirred the contents, offered the cup. <lb/>
            But that audacious woman, in order that she might at the <lb/>
            same moment remove the accomplice in her crime, and save <lb/>
            the money which she had promised, held back the cup in the <lb/>
            presence of them all, and said, "Most worthy of doctors, you <lb/>
            must not give this draught to my dearest husband till you <lb/>
            have swallowed a good portion of it yourself. For how am I <lb/>
            to know but that there may be some deadly poison in it ? And <lb/>
            this ought by no means to offend you, who are a man so pru­ <lb/>
            dent and so learned, if I, as an affectionate wife, am anxious for <note type="footnote"> * Proserpine.]—The goddess of death. </note> <pb n="213"/>
            <note type="margin"> BOOK X. </note> <lb/>
            the safety of my husband, and so perform a necessary act of <lb/>
            duty." The physician, quite confounded by the desperate <lb/>
            assurance of the bloodthirsty woman, and having no time to <lb/>
            think of any subterfuge, could not help drinking largely of the <lb/>
            potion, lest he should excite suspicion of his guilt if he showed <lb/>
            any hesitation or fear. Then the young man, confidently fol­ <lb/>
            lowing his example, took the cup from his hand, and drank <lb/>
            what was left.</p>
          <p>The matter being for the present finished, the physician was <lb/>
            preparing to return home as quickly as possible, in order that <lb/>
            he might counteract the deadly effects of the poison he had <lb/>
            taken, by a timely antidote. But the barbarous woman, bent <lb/>
            on completing her infernal work, would not suffer him to de­ <lb/>
            part from her a hair's breadth till, as she said, the potion <lb/>
            should have been digested and its effect determined by actual <lb/>
            proof. However, after much importunate entreaty, she at <lb/>
            length reluctantly allowed him to go. In the meantime, the <lb/>
            virulence of the fatal poison had spread through all his inside, <lb/>
            and made havoc in his vitals. Stupified, and in excruciating <lb/>
            pain, it was with the utmost difficulty he reached home, where <lb/>
            he had barely time to relate what had happened, and give in­ <lb/>
            junctions to his wife, at all events, to demand the promised re­ <lb/>
            ward for thus ensuring the death of two persons. Thus cut off . <lb/>
            by a violent death, did this very celebrated doctor breathe his <lb/>
            last.</p>
          <p>Nor did the young man live much longer, but perished by <lb/>
            the same kind of death, amid the feigned tears of his false <lb/>
            wife. After he had been committed to the tomb, and a few <lb/>
            days had intervened, during which funeral obsequies were per­ <lb/>
            formed for the dead, the widow of the physician came and <lb/>
            demanded the money which was due for the double homicide. <lb/>
            But the other widow, always consistent with herself, put on a <lb/>
            very unreal appearance of good faith, and replied with great <lb/>
            suavity, assuring the applicant that she would promptly pay <lb/>
            ner the stipulated sum, only she wished she would give her a <lb/>
            little of the same mixture, for the purpose of completing the <lb/>
            business she had begun.</p>
          <p>Completely duped by her insidious perfidy, the doctor's <lb/>
            widow readily consented to do as she was requested; and that <lb/>
            she might ingratiate herself the more with this wealthy wo­ <lb/>
            man, she hastened home, and immediately brought her the <lb/>
             <pb n="214"/>
            whole box of poison. Having, therefore, obtained that power­ <lb/>
            ful instrument of crime, the wretch now prepared to indulge <lb/>
            her murderous propensities without stint.</p>
          <p>She had an infant daughter, by the husband whom she had <lb/>
            lately murdered; and she felt extremely galled that the laws <lb/>
            would give to this little child the inheritance of her father, as <lb/>
            being his next of kin. Coveting the whole patrimony of the <lb/>
            daughter, she waited only for an opportunity of depriving her <lb/>
            of life. Making sure, therefore, that wicked mothers come in <lb/>
            for the reversion of the inheritances of their deceased children, <lb/>
            she showed herself to be just such a parent as she had been a <lb/>
            wife. Accordingly, preparing a breakfast, she seized her op­ <lb/>
            portunity, and with the same poison destroyed both the widow <lb/>
            of the physician and her own daughter. As for the child, the <lb/>
            baneful venom instantly stopped her breathing, and consumed <lb/>
            her tender life. But as for the doctor's widow, when she felt <lb/>
            the virus of the detestable drug creeping through her lungs, <lb/>
            she at once suspected the truth; the increasing difficulty of <lb/>
            her breathing converted her suspicion into a certainty, and she <lb/>
            hastened at once to the house of the governor of the province, <lb/>
            clamorous for justice, and declaring she had enormous crimes <lb/>
            to reveal. A great concourse of people gathered round her, <lb/>
            and the governor immediately gave her a hearing. After she <lb/>
            had unfolded to him from first to last all the atrocities of that <lb/>
            horrible woman, she was seized with a fit; her mouth, that <lb/>
            was open in the act of speaking, closed convulsively; she <lb/>
            ground her teeth violently together, and fell dead at the go­ <lb/>
            vernor's feet. That able and energetic functionary would not <lb/>
            allow the manifold crimes of this execrable poisoner to lose <lb/>
            their terrors by delay, but immediately ordered her chamber­ <lb/>
            maids to be brought before him, and extracted the truth from <lb/>
            them by means of torture. On their deposition he sentenced <lb/>
            the culprit to a punishment which was no doubt less than she <lb/>
            deserved, but as no other torment could be devised so well <lb/>
            adapted to the enormity of her guilt, he ordered that she should <lb/>
            be thrown to wild beasts.</p>
          <p>END OF THE FOURTEENTH EPISODE.</p>
          <p>With such a woman as this it was determined that I should <lb/>
            be publicly connected, as if I had been lawfully married to her. <lb/>
            It was with extreme anguish, therefore, that I looked forward <pb n="215"/>
            <note type="margin"> BOOK X. </note> <lb/>
            to the day of the spectacle; being frequently tempted rather <lb/>
            to destroy myself with my own hand, than be defiled by con­ <lb/>
            tact with such an abandoned woman, or be disgraced by the <lb/>
            infamy of such a public spectacle. But, as I was destitute of <lb/>
            human hands and of fingers, I had no means of drawing a <lb/>
            sword with my round and stumpy hoof. However, I consoled <lb/>
            myself, as well as I could, in my extreme anguish, with a slen­ <lb/>
            der hope; for the spring now beginning to appear, would deck <lb/>
            all the country with flowering buds, and clothe the meadows <lb/>
            with a purple glow; the roses would burst forth from their <lb/>
            thorny cells, exhaling aromatic odours, and these would restore <lb/>
            me to my former shape as Lucius.</p>
          <p>And now behold, the day destined for the show came; and <lb/>
            amid shouts of applause, a long train escorting me, I was led <lb/>
            to the amphitheatre. During the first part of the performance, <lb/>
            which was devoted to the joyous choral dances of the players, <lb/>
            I was placed outside the gate, and was glad to crop some very <lb/>
            fresh grass which grew just at the entrance; while I every <lb/>
            now and then delighted my curious eyes with a most agreeable <lb/>
            view of the spectacle through the open gate.</p>
          <p>Beautiful boys and maidens, in the bloom of youth, splen­ <lb/>
            didly dressed, moved with great elegance of gesture through <lb/>
            the graceful evolutions of the Greek Pyrrhic dance. Now they <lb/>
            revolved in a circle; now they deployed into an oblique line, <lb/>
            with hands joined ; at times they formed a wedge-like figure <lb/>
            enclosing an open square; then they parted into two troops, <lb/>
            and went through a variety of intricate movements, till they <lb/>
            ceased at the sound of the trumpet. Then the screen was <lb/>
            lowered, the hangings were drawn aside, and a dramatic scene <lb/>
            was exhibited.</p>
          <p>There was a wooden structure formed in imitation of that <lb/>
            celebrated mountain, Ida, of which the poet Homer has sung. <lb/>
            It was a fabric of considerable height, covered over with turf <lb/>
            and with growing trees up to the very top, whence, by the con­ <lb/>
            trivance of the artist, a fountain was made to flow and pour down <lb/>
            a stream of water. A few goats cropped the grass, and a young <lb/>
            man, handsomely arrayed in flowing Barbaric vestments, and <lb/>
            having his head covered with a golden tiara, in resemblance of <lb/>
            Paris, the Phrygian shepherd, appeared to be employed in pas­ <lb/>
            toral pursuits. A beautiful boy then came forward, his only <lb/>
            garment being the mantle generally worn by striplings, which <lb/>
             <pb n="216"/>
            covered his left shoulder. His beautiful yellow hair flowed <lb/>
            loosely, and from the midst of it issued a pair of little golden <lb/>
            wings; these and the caduceus he carried showed him to be <lb/>
            Mercury. He danced forward, holding in his hand a golden <lb/>
            apple, which he presented to the performer who personated <lb/>
            Paris, made known to him by signs what Jove commanded, <lb/>
            and gracefully retired. A girl then made her appearance, of <lb/>
            noble features, representing the goddess Juno.: for her head <lb/>
            was surrounded with a white diadem, and she bore a sceptre <lb/>
            in her hand. Another then entered, who was easy to be recog­ <lb/>
            nized as Minerva, having on her head a shining helmet, en­ <lb/>
            circled with a wreath of olive. She raised her shield aloft, <lb/>
            and brandished her spear, like that goddess when engaged in <lb/>
            battle. After these came another female, of surpassing beauty; <lb/>
            the loveliness of her divine complexion declared her to be Venus, <lb/>
            and Venus such as she was while yet a virgin. Her perfect <lb/>
            form was naked, all but some charms imperfectly concealed by <lb/>
            a gauze scarf, which the wind played with amorously, some­ <lb/>
            times uncovering the beauties beneath it, sometimes pressing <lb/>
            it against the limbs, and displaying their delicious contour. <lb/>
            The goddess appeared in two different colours; her body was <lb/>
            dazzlingly white, because she had descended from the heavens, <lb/>
            while her silken garment was azure, because she had emerged <lb/>
            from the sea.</p>
          <p>The virgins who represented the goddesses were accompanied <lb/>
            by their respective attendants : Juno by two young players, <lb/>
            representing Castor and Pollux, whose heads were covered with <lb/>
            helmets of semi-oval form, graced with a cluster of stars. She <lb/>
            advanced with a calm and unaffected air to the warbling of the <lb/>
            flute, and promised the shepherd, with modest gestures, that <lb/>
            she would bestow on him the empire of all Asia, if he adjudged <lb/>
            to her the prize of beauty.</p>
          <p>She who personated Minerva was attended by two armed <lb/>
            youths, Terror and Fear, who danced before her with drawn <lb/>
            swords. Behind her a piper played a martial air, mingling shrill <lb/>
            and deep-braying tones, and excited the agility of the dancers <lb/>
            as with the blast of the trumpet. With restless head and <lb/>
            threatening glances, Pallas bounded forward, and with animated <lb/>
            gesture signified to Paris that if he pronounced her victorious <lb/>
            in the contest of beauty, she woUld render him illustrious for <lb/>
            his valour, and his achievements in war.</p><pb n="217"/>
            
          <p><note type="margin"> BOOK X. </note> Greeted with vast applause from the spectators, Venus ad­ <lb/>
            vanced with a sweet smile, and stood still in a graceful attitude <lb/>
            in the middle of the stage, surrounded by a throng of merry <lb/>
            little boys, such plump, round-limbed, fair-skinned little fel­ <lb/>
            lows, you would have sworn they were real Cupids, who had <lb/>
            just flown from heaven or from the sea; for they had little <lb/>
            wings, and arrows, and all other accoutrements conformable; <lb/>
            and they carried gleaming torches before their mistress, as if <lb/>
            to light her way to a nuptial banquet. She had also in her <lb/>
            train a lovely choir of virgins, the charming Graces and the <lb/>
            Hours, who strewed the path of their goddess with loose flowers <lb/>
            and bouquets, and propitiated the queen of pleasure with the <lb/>
            pleasant offerings of the spring.</p>
          <p>Presently the flutes began to breathe soft Lydian airs, that <lb/>
            thrilled the audience with delight; but greater still was their <lb/>
            delight, when Venus began to move in concert with the music, <lb/>
            and with slow lingering steps, and gentle sinuous flexure of the <lb/>
            spine and head, and graceful movements of the arms, to respond <lb/>
            to the soft modulations of the flutes; while now her eyes swam <lb/>
            with voluptuous languor, now flashed with the ardour of pas­ <lb/>
            sion, and sometimes she seemed, as it were, to dance with her <lb/>
            eyes alone. As soon as she had approached close to the judge, <lb/>
            she was understood to promise, by the movements of her arms, <lb/>
            that if she was preferred to the other goddesses, she would <lb/>
            bestow on Paris a wife surpassing all women in beauty, in a <lb/>
            word, one like herself. Gladly, then, did the young Phrygian <lb/>
            deliver to her the golden apple he held in his hand, as a token <lb/>
            of her victory.</p>
          <p>What wonder is it, then, you vilest of people, forensic cattle <lb/>
            rather, vultures clad in gowns, if all judges now sell their de­ <lb/>
            cisions for a price ? Even in the early ages of the world, <lb/>
            favour was able to corrupt judgment in a question agitated <lb/>
            between Gods and men, and a young man, a rustic and a shep­ <lb/>
            herd, elected judge by the counsels of mighty Jupiter, bartered <lb/>
            the first judicial decision for the lucre of lust, ensuring thereby <lb/>
            the destruction of all his race. Ay, by Hercules, and another <lb/>
            such judgment was given in later times, by the illustrious <lb/>
            leaders of the Greeks, when Palamedes, renowned for wisdom <lb/>
            and learning, was condemned on false accusations as a traitor; <lb/>
            as also when the mendicant Ulysses was preferred to the <lb/>
            mighty Ajax, who excelled in military prowess. And what sort <lb/>
             <pb n="218"/>
            of judgment was that given by those renowned lawgivers, the <lb/>
            Athenians, .those clever people, and masters of all the sciences? <lb/>
            Was not that divinely wise old man, whom the Delphic god <lb/>
            pronounced superior in wisdom to all men, circumvented by <lb/>
            the treachery and envy of a most infamous faction, as a de­ <lb/>
            clared corrupter of youth, though he restrained their excesses <lb/>
            as with a bridle ? Was he not cut off by the deadly juice of a <lb/>
            pestilential herb, leaving to his fellow-citizens the stain-of <lb/>
            indelible ignominy ? For even at this day the most excellent <lb/>
            philosophers make choice of his most holy sect before all others, <lb/>
            and swear by his name, in their highest aspirations for con­ <lb/>
            summate happiness.</p>
          <p>Lest, however, any one blame this outburst of indignation, <lb/>
            and say to himself, Look ye now, are we to suffer an ass to <lb/>
            philosophize to us ? I shall again return to the point in the <lb/>
            narrative from which I digressed. After that judgment of <lb/>
            Paris was finished, Juno and Minerva retired from the stage <lb/>
            in sorrow and anger, and showed by their gestures the indig­ <lb/>
            nation they felt at being rejected; but Venus, full of joy and <lb/>
            merriment, testified her gladness by dancing with all her choir. <lb/>
            Then wine, mixed with saffron, burst forth on high from the <lb/>
            summit of the mountain, through a pipe that lay concealed, <lb/>
            and flowing in scattered streams, besprinkled as it fell, with <lb/>
            an odoriferous shower, the goats that fed around, and changed <lb/>
            their native whiteness for a more beautiful yellow tint. And <lb/>
            now, the whole theatre exhaling a sweet odour, a chasm of the <lb/>
            earth absorbed the wooden mountain.</p>
          <p>One of the soldiers now ran down the street, to fulfil the <lb/>
            demands of the people, and bring from the public prison the <lb/>
            woman before-mentioned, who, as I have stated, was condemned <lb/>
            to the wild beasts, on account of her manifold crimes, and des­ <lb/>
            tined to be my illustrious bride. What was intended also to <lb/>
            be our genial bed was already prepared. It was brilliantly <lb/>
            adorned with the Indian tortoise-shell, swelling with feathery <lb/>
            heaps, and decorated with a silken coverlet. As for me, be­ <lb/>
            sides the shame of being thus publicly exhibited, and besides <lb/>
            the contact of that wicked and polluted woman, I was also in <lb/>
            the highest degree tormented with the fear of death ; for it <lb/>
            struck me that if, while we were performing our prescribed <lb/>
            part in the exhibition, any wild beast should be let in on pur­ <lb/>
            pose to destroy the woman, it would not be so remarkably well <pb n="219"/>
            <note type="margin"> BOOK X. </note> <lb/>
            trained or sagacious, or so temperate and abstemious, as to tear <lb/>
            the woman to pieces who was at my side, and spare me, as being <lb/>
            uncondemned, and guilty of no crime.</p>
          <p>Being therefore alarmed, not on grounds of delicacy alone, <lb/>
            but on account of my life, while my master was intent on pre­ <lb/>
            paring for the representation, and all his servants were partly <lb/>
            engaged in getting ready for the spectacle of hunting, and <lb/>
            partly in gazing at the grandeur of the show : and as no one <lb/>
            thought that so tame an ass required to be so very attentively <lb/>
            watched, and I was free to follow my own devices, accordingly <lb/>
            little by little I stole away softly and quietly. When I reached <lb/>
            the nearest gate, I hurried along at a most rapid pace. And <lb/>
            after I had travelled a hot gallop of six miles, I arrived at <lb/>
            Cenchreæ; a city which has the reputation of being the most <lb/>
            noble colony of the Corinthians, and is washed by the Ægean <lb/>
            and Saronic sea. Here, also, there is a port, which is a most <lb/>
            safe harbour for ships, and frequented by a vast concourse of <lb/>
            people.</p>
          <p>Avoiding, therefore, the crowds, and choosing a sequestered <lb/>
            spot on the sea-shore, close to the spray of the waves, I stretched <lb/>
            my weary body on the soft bosom of the sand. The chariot of <lb/>
            the sun had sped onward to the end of its course; and I re­ <lb/>
            signed myself to repose, and was soon wrapped in sweet sleep.</p><pb n="220"/>

          <p>AWAKING in sudden alarm about the first watch of the <lb/>
            night, I beheld the full orb of the moon shining with re­ <lb/>
            markable brightness, and just then emerging from the waves <lb/>
            of the sea. Availing myself, therefore, of the silence and soli­ <lb/>
            tude of night, as I was also well aware that the great primal <lb/>
            goddess possessed a transcendent majesty, and that human <lb/>
            affairs are entirely governed by her providence; and that not <lb/>
            only cattle and wild beasts, but likewise things inanimate, are <lb/>
            invigorated by the divine influence of her light; that the bodies <lb/>
            likewise which are on the earth, in the heavens, and in the <lb/>
            sea, at one time increase with her increments, and at another <lb/>
            lessen duly with her wanings; being well assured of this, I <lb/>
            determined to implore the august image of the goddess then <lb/>
            present, Fate, as I supposed, being now satiated with my many <lb/>
            and great calamities, and holding out to me at last some pro­ <lb/>
            spect of relief.</p>
          <p>Shaking off all drowsiness, therefore, I rose with alacrity, <lb/>
            and directly, with the intention of purifying myself, began <lb/>
            bathing in the sea. Having dipped my head seven times in <lb/>
            the waves, because, according to the divine Pythagoras, that <lb/>
            number is especially adapted to religious purposes, I joyously <lb/>
            and with alacrity thus supplicated with a tearful countenance <lb/>
            the transcendently powerful Goddess:-</p>
          <p>" Queen of heaven, whether thou art the genial Ceres, the <lb/>
            prime parent of fruits, who, joyous at the discovery of thy <lb/>
            daughter, didst banish the savage nutriment of the ancient <pb n="221"/>
             <note type="margin">BOOK XI. </note> <lb/>
            acorn, and pointing out a better food, dost now till the Eleusi- <lb/>
            nian soil; or whether thou art celestial Venus, who, in the first <lb/>

            whatever ceremonies, and under whatever form* it is lawful <note type="footnote"> * Whatever form.]—The Moon, being the last of the celestial divinities, <lb/>
            receives in herself, according to the Orphic theology, processions from all <lb/>
            the orders of Gods superior to, and also contains in herself casually all the <lb/>
            divinities inferior to her. Hence, from what is asserted here, and farther on, <lb/>
            this Goddess is celebrated as containing all the female deities, just as Osiris <lb/>
            contains all those of a male character. In short, according to this theology, <lb/>
            each of the Gods is in all, and all are in each, being ineffably united to <lb/>
            each other and the highest God, because, each being a superessential <lb/>
            unity, their conjunction with each other is a union of unities. And hence <lb/>
            it is by no means wonderful that each is celebrated as all. But another <lb/>
            and a still more appropriate cause may be assigned of the Moon being <lb/>
            called by the appellations of so many female deities, which is this, that, <lb/>
            according to the Orphic theology, each of the planets is fixed in a lumi­ <lb/>
            nous etherial sphere called an <foreign xml:lang="grc">ολοτης</foreign>,or wholeness,† because it is a part <lb/>
            with a total subsistence, and is analogous to the sphere of the fixed stars. <lb/>
            In consequence of this analogy, each of these planetary spheres contains a <lb/>
            multitude of Gods, who are the satellites of the leading divinity of the <lb/>
            sphere, and subsist conformably to his characteristics. This doctrine, <lb/>
            which, as I have elsewhere observed, is one of the grand keys to the my­ <lb/>
            thology and theology of the ancients, is not clearly delivered by any other <lb/>
            ancient writer than Proclus, and has not, I believe, been noticed by any <lb/>
            other modern author than myself. The following are the passages in <lb/>
            which this theory is unfolded by Proclus, in his admirable commentaries </note> <note type="footnote"> t Each of these spheres is called a wholeness, because it contains t <lb/>
            multitude of partial animals co-ordinate with it. </note> <lb/>

            to invoke thee; do thou graciously succour me in this my <lb/>
            extreme distress, support my fallen fortune, and grant me rest <note type="footnote">on the Timæus of Plato. ' In each of the celestial spheres, the whole <lb/>
            sphere has the relation of a monad, but the cosmocrators [or planets] are <lb/>
            the leaders of the multitude in each. For in each a number analogous to <lb/>
            the choir of the fixed stars, subsists with appropriate circulations.' And <lb/>
            in another part of the same book (p. 280), ' There are other divine ani. <lb/>
            mals following the circulations of the planets, the leaders of which are the <lb/>
            seven planets; all which Plato comprehends in what is here said. For <lb/>
            these also revolve and have a wandering of such a kind as that which he <lb/>
            a little before mentioned of the seven planets. For they revolve in con­ <lb/>
            junction with and make their apocatastases together with their principals, <lb/>
            just as the fixed stars are governed by the whole circulation of the [iner­ <lb/>
            ratic sphere].' And still more fully in p. 281; " Each of the planets is <lb/>
            a whole world, comprehending in itself many divine genera invisible to <lb/>
            us. Of all these, however, the visible star has the government. And in <lb/>
            this the fixed stars differ from those in the planetary spheres, that the <lb/>
            former have one monad [viz., the inerratic sphere], which is the wholeness <lb/>
            of them; but that in each of the latter there are invisible stars, which <lb/>
            revolve together with their spheres; so that in each there is both the <lb/>
            wholeness and a leader, which is allotted an exempt transcendency. For <lb/>
            the planets being secondary to the fixed stars, require a twofold prefec­ <lb/>
            ture, the one more total, but the other more partial. But that in each of <lb/>
            these there is a multitude co-ordinate with each, you may infer from the <lb/>
            extremes. For if the inerratic sphere has a multitude co-ordinate with <lb/>
            itself, and earth is the wholeness of terrestrial, in the same manner as the <lb/>
            inerratic sphere is of celestial animals, it is necessary that each interme­ <lb/>
            diate wholeness should entirely possess certain partial animals co-ordinate <lb/>
            with itself; through which, also, they are said to be wholenesses. The <lb/>
            intermediate natures, however, are concealed from our sense, the extremes <lb/>
            being manifest: one of them through its transcendently luminous essence, <lb/>
            and the other through its alliance to us. If, likewise, partial souls <lb/>
            [such as ours] are disseminated about them, some about the sun, others <lb/>
            about the moon, and others about each of the rest, and prior to souls, <lb/>
            daemons give completion to the herds of which they are the leaders, it is <lb/>
            evidently well said, that each of the spheres is a world; theologists also <lb/>
            teaching us these things when they say that there are Gods in each prior <lb/>
            to daemons, some of which are under the government of others. Thus, for <lb/>
            instance, they assert, concerning our mistress the Moon, that the Goddess <lb/>
            Hecate is contained in her, and also Diana. Thus, too, in speaking of <lb/>
            the sovereign Sun, and the Gods that are there, they celebrate Bacchus <lb/>
            as being there- \ <lb/>
            " The sun's assessor, who with watchful eye <lb/>
            Surveys the sacred pole." </note><note type="footnote"> They likewise celebrate the Jupiter who is there, Osiris, the solar Pan, <lb/>
            and others of which the books of theologists and theurgists are full; </note> <pb n="223"/>

            and peace, after the endurance of so many sad calamities. Let <lb/>
            there be an end of my sufferings, let there be an end of my <lb/>
            perils. Remove from me the dire form of a quadruped, restore <lb/>
            me to the sight of my kindred, restore me to Lucius, my former <lb/>
            self. But if any offended deity pursues me with inexorable <lb/>
            cruelty, may it at least be allowed me to die, if it is not al­ <lb/>
            lowed me to live." <note type="footnote"> from all which it is evident, that each of the planets is truly said to <lb/>
            be the leader of many Gods, who give completion to its peculiar cir­ <lb/>
            culation.' </note><note type="footnote"> From this extraordinary passage, we may perceive at once why the <lb/>
            Sun in the Orphic hymns is called Jupiter, why Apollo is called Pan, and <lb/>
            Bacchus the Sun ; why the Moon seems to be the same with Rhea, Ceres, <lb/>
            Proserpine, Juno, Venus, &amp;c., and in short, why any one divinity is cele­ <lb/>
            brated with the names and epithets of so many of the rest. For from this <lb/>
            sublime theory it follows that every sphere contains a Jupiter, Neptune, <lb/>
            Vulcan, Vesta, Minerva, Mars, Ceres, Juno, Diana, Mercury, Venus, <lb/>
            Apollo, and in short, every deity, each sphere at the same time con­ <lb/>
            ferring on these Gods the peculiar characteristic of its nature; so that, <lb/>
            for instance, in the Sun they all possess a solar property, in the Moon a <lb/>
            lunar one, and so of the rest. From this theory, too, we may perceive the <lb/>
            truth of that divine saying of the ancients, that all things are full of Gods; <lb/>
            for more particular orders proceed from such as are more general, the <lb/>
            mundane from the super-mundane, and the sublunary from the celestial; <lb/>
            while earth becomes the general receptacle of the illuminations of all the <lb/>
            Gods. ' Hence,' as Proclus shortly after observes, ' there is a terrestrial <lb/>
            Ceres, Vesta, and Isis, as likewise a terrestrial Jupiter and a terrestrial <lb/>
            Hermes, established about the one divinity of the earth, just as a multitude <lb/>
            of celestial Gods proceeds about the one divinity of the heavens. For <lb/>
            there are progressions of all the celestial Gods into the Earth: and Earth <lb/>
            contains all things, in an earthly manner, which Heaven comprehends <lb/>
            celestially. Hence, we speak of a terrestrial Bacchus and a terrestrial <lb/>
            Apollo, who bestows the all-various streams of water with which the earth <lb/>
            abounds, and openings prophetic of futurity.' And if to all this we only <lb/>
            add, that all the other mundane Gods subsist in the twelve above-mentioned, <lb/>
            and in short, all the mundane in the super-mundane Gods, and that the <lb/>
            first triad of these is demiurgic orfabricative, viz. Jupiter, Neptune, Vulcan; <lb/>
            the second, Vesta, Minerva, Mars, defensive; the third, Ceres, Juno, Diana, <lb/>
            vivific; and the fourth, Mercury, Venus, Apollo, elevating and harmonic; <lb/>
            I say, if we unite this with the preceding theory, there is nothing in the <lb/>
            ancient theology that will not appear admirably sublime and beautifully <lb/>
            connected, accurate in all its parts, scientific and divine. </note><note type="footnote"> The Delphin editor, having no conception of this theory, and being <lb/>

          <p>Having after this manner poured forth my prayers and <lb/>
            added bitter lamentations, sleep again overpowered my stricken <lb/>
            feelings on the same bed. Scarcely had I closed my eyes, <lb/>
            when behold! a divine form emerged from the middle of the <lb/>
            sea, and disclosed features that even the gods themselves might <lb/>
            venerate. After this, by degrees, the vision, resplendent <lb/>
            throughout the whole body, seemed gradually to take its stand <lb/>
            before me, rising above the surface of the sea. I will even <lb/>
            make an attempt to describe to you its wondrous appearance, <lb/>
            if, indeed, the poverty of human language will afford me the <lb/>
            power of appropriately setting it forth; or, if the Divinity <lb/>
            herself will supply me with a sufficient stock of eloquent <lb/>
            diction.</p>
          <p>In the first place, then, her hair, long and hanging in tapered <lb/>
            ringlets, fell luxuriantly on her divine neck; a crown of varied <lb/>
            form encircled the summit of her head, with a diversity of <lb/>
            flowers, and in the middle of it, just over her forehead, there <lb/>
            was a flat circlet, which resembled a mirror, or rather emitted <lb/>
            a white refulgent light, thus indicating that she was the <lb/>
            moon. Vipers rising from furrows of the earth, supported <lb/>
            this on the right hand and on the left, while ears of corn pro­ <lb/>
            jected on either side. Her garment was of many colours, <lb/>
            woven of fine flax; in one part it was resplendent with a clear <lb/>
            white colour, in another it was yellow like the blooming <lb/>
            crocus, and in another flaming with a rosy redness. And <lb/>
            then, what rivetted my gaze far more than all, was her <lb/>
            mantle of the deepest black, that shone with a glossy lustre. <lb/>
            It was wrapped around her, and passing from below her right <lb/>
            side over the left shoulder, was fastened in a knot that resem­ <lb/>
            bled the boss of a shield, while a part of the robe fell down in <lb/>
            many folds, and gracefully floated with its little knots of fringe <lb/>
            that edged its extremities. Glittering stars were dispersed <lb/>
            along the embroidered extremities of the robe, and over its <lb/>
            whole surface; and in the middle of them a moon of two <lb/>
            weeks old breathed forth its flaming fires. Besides this, a <lb/>
            garland, wholly consisting of flowers and fruits of every kind, <lb/>
            adhered naturally to the border of this beautiful mantle, in <lb/>
            whatever direction it was wafted by the breeze.</p>
          <p>The objects which she carried in her hands were of a diffe­ <lb/>
            rent description. In her right hand she bore a brazen sistrum,* <note type="footnote"> * Brazen sistrum.]—This rattle (in the original crepitaculum) of Isis </note> <pb n="225"/>
            <note type="margin"> BOOK XI. </note> <lb/>
            through the narrow rim of which, winding just like a girdle <lb/>
            for the body, passed a few little rods, producing a sharp shrill <lb/>
            sound, while her arm imparted motion to the triple chords. <lb/>
            An oblong vessel, made of gold, in the shape of a boat, hung <note type="footnote"> is the same with the celebrated sistrum of that Goddess, as is evident from <lb/>
            what is asserted of the latter by Martial. Propertius, and Plutarch. </note><note type="footnote"> The following is a translation of what Plutarch says concerning this <lb/>
            sistrum in his treatise of Isis and Osiris, and is remarkably interesting <lb/>
            both to the antiquarian and philosopher: ' The sistrum likewise indicates <lb/>
            that it is necessary that beings should be agitated, and never cease to rest <lb/>
            from their local motion, but should be excited and shaken, when they <lb/>
            become drowsy and marcid. For they say that Typhon is deterred and <lb/>
            repelled by the sistra; manifesting by this, that as corruption binds and <lb/>
            stops [the course of things], so generation again resolves nature, and <lb/>
            excites it through motion. But as the upper part of the sistrum is convex, <lb/>
            so the concavity of it comprehends the four things that are agitated. For <lb/>
            the generable and corruptible portion of the world is comprehended indeed <lb/>
            by the lunar sphere; but all things are moved and changed in this sphere, <lb/>
            through the four elements of fire and earth, water and air. And on the <lb/>
            summit of the concavity of the sistrum they carved a cat having a human <lb/>
            face; and on the under part, below the rattling rods, they placed on one <lb/>
            side the face of Isis, and on the other that of Nephthys, obscurely signify­ <lb/>
            ing by these faces generation and death [or corruption] : for these are the <lb/>
            mutations and motions of the elements. But by the cat they indicated <lb/>
            the moon, on account of the diversity of colours, operation by night, and <lb/>
            fecundity of this animal. For it is said, that she brings forth one, after­ <lb/>
            wards two, three, four, and five kittens, and so adds till she has brought <lb/>
            forth seven; so that she brings forth twenty-eight in all, which is the <lb/>
            number of the illuminations of the moon. This, therefore, is perhaps <lb/>
            more mythologically asserted. The pupils, however, in the eyes of the <lb/>
            cat, are seen to become full and to be dilated when the moon is full, and <lb/>
            to be diminished and deprived of light during the decrease of this star.' </note><note type="footnote"> In this extract, Baxter, in his translation, makes the rods of the sistrum <lb/>
            to be four. For he translates <foreign xml:lang="grc">υπο</foreign>.ra <foreign xml:lang="grc">σειμενα</foreign>,below the four jingling <lb/>
            things,' which I have translated, below the rattling rods. The sistrum, <lb/>
            however, according to all the representations of it that are extant, contained <lb/>
            but three rods. Baxter was doubtless led thus to translate ra <foreign xml:lang="grc">σειμενα</foreign>, <lb/>
            because Plutarch had observed a little before that ' the concavity of the <lb/>
            sistrum comprehends the four things that are agitated,' i. e. the four ele. <lb/>
            ments. But as there is no sphere of fire, as there is of each of the other <lb/>
            elements ; for sublunary fireis an efflux of. the celestial fire, and subsists <lb/>
            in the cavities of the other elements ; hence, the three rods indicate the <lb/>
            three elements, air, water, and earth, and the concavity of the arch of the <lb/>
            sistrum will represent the summit of the air, which imitates the purity of <lb/>
            the vivific and unburning fire of the heavens. For true fire is in the heavens; <lb/>
            but of sublunary fire the purest is ether, and the most gross is in the inte­ <lb/>
            rior parts of the earth.- Taylor. </note> <note type="footnote"> Q </note> <lb/>

            stormy waves of the ocean lulled, and the sea itself has become <lb/>
            navigable. That sacred ceremonial you must await, with a <lb/>
            mind neither full of anxiety, nor intent upon subjects that are <lb/>
            profane. For the priest, at my command, will carry in the <lb/>
            procession a crown of roses, attached to the sistrum in his right <lb/>
            hand. Without delay, then, pushing the crowd aside, join my <lb/>
            procession, and put your trust in my gracious disposition ; then, <lb/>
            having approached close, as though to kiss the hand of the <lb/>
            priest, gently pluck the roses, and at once divest yourself of <lb/>
            the hide of that abominable beast, which I have long looked <lb/>
            upon with detestation.</p>
          <p>" Nor hold in dread any thing pertaining to my concerns as <lb/>
            difficult. For even at this very same instant* of time in which I <lb/>
            appear to you here present, I am giving orders also to my priest <lb/>
            how to bring about the things that are to take place hereafter. <lb/>
            By my command, the dense crowds of people shall give way <lb/>
            before you. Neither, amid the joyous rites and festive scenes, <lb/>
            will any one view with abhorrence the unsightliness of the <lb/>
            figure which you bear, or malignantly accuse you, by putting <lb/>
            a sinister interpretation on the sudden change of your form. <lb/>
            Only remember, and always keep it fast in the very depths of <lb/>
            your heart, that the remaining period of your life must be dedi­ <lb/>
            cated to me, even to the moment of your latest breath. Nor <lb/>
            is it unjust that you should devote your whole life to that god­ <lb/>
            dess, by whose assistance you will have been restored to human <lb/>
            form. But under my protection you will live happy, you will <lb/>
            live glorious: and when, having passed through the allotted <lb/>
            period of your life, you shall descend to the realms beneath, <lb/>
            there, also, in the subterranean hemisphere, you, dwelling in <lb/>
            the Elysian fields, shall frequently adore me whom you now <lb/>
            behold thus propitious to you, and shall there see me shining <lb/>
            amidst the darkness of Acheron, and reigning in the Stygian <lb/>
            realms. And further, if you shall be found to deserve the <lb/>
            protection of my divinity by sedulous obedience, religious de­ <lb/>
            votion, and inviolable chastity, you shall be sensible that it is <lb/>
            possible for me, and me alone, to extend your life beyond the <lb/>
            limits that have been appointed to it by your destiny." <note type="footnote"> * At this very same instant.]—For a divine nature is at one and the same <lb/>
            time present every where.- Taylor. </note> <note type="footnote"> Q 2 </note> <pb n="228"/>
            </p>
          <p>The venerable oracle having thus concluded, the invin­ <lb/>
            cible divinity dissolved into herself. Instantly shaking off <lb/>
            sleep, I arose, in a state of fear and joy, and bathed in per­ <lb/>
            spiration. Astonished in the highest degree at so evident a <lb/>
            manifestation of the powerful goddess, having sprinkled myself <lb/>
            with the spray of the sea, and intent on her high commands, I <lb/>
            tried to recall to mind the successive particulars of her injunc­ <lb/>
            tions. Soon after this, the golden sun arose, and put to flight <lb/>
            the clouds of dark night: and now, behold, a crowd of people <lb/>
            filled all the streets with a religious procession, conducted in a <lb/>
            style of triumph. All things likewise, independently of my <lb/>
            own delight, seemed to me to be affected with the greatest <lb/>
            hilarity, insomuch that I thought even the cattle of all kinds, <lb/>
            every house, and the day itself, wore an aspect of gladness and <lb/>
            serenity; for a sunny and placid day had suddenly succeeded <lb/>
            to the frost of the previous one; so that, allured by the warmth <lb/>
            of the spring, the tuneful little birds sang sweetly, and with <lb/>
            their merry warbling soothed Her who was the mother of the <lb/>
            stars, the parent of the seasons, and the mistress of the whole <lb/>
            universe. And then the trees, too, both those prolific and <lb/>
            those which only yielded a shade, unbound from their wintry <lb/>
            sleep by the warm southern breezes, and embellished with <lb/>
            young foliage, sent forth a sweet rustling sound from their <lb/>
            branches. The waves of the sea, no longer heaving turbidly <lb/>
            to the roaring blast of the tempest, gently washed the shore; <lb/>
            the dark clouds were dispersed, and the heavens shone with the <lb/>
            serene splendour of their native light.</p>
          <p>And now, behold, the prelude to the grand procession came <lb/>
            gradually into action. The persons who composed it were all <lb/>
            finely caparisoned in various ways, each according to his own <lb/>
            taste and inclination. This man, being girded with a belt, repre­ <lb/>
            sented a soldier; another was equipped as a hunter, with a short <lb/>
            scarf, a hunting-knife, and javelin. Another, wearing gilded <lb/>
            sandals, a silken garment, and precious female ornaments, and <lb/>
            with false hair on his head, personated a woman by his appear­ <lb/>
            ance and his gait. Another, with his boots, his shield, his <lb/>
            helmet, and his sword, appeared as though he had come straight <lb/>
            from the school of the gladiators. There was one who played <lb/>
            the part of a magistrate, with the fasces and the purple robe; <lb/>
            another that of a philosopher, with his cloak, his staff, his <lb/>
            wooden-clogged shoes, and his goatish beard; two persons, <pb n="229"/>
            <note type="margin"> BOOK XI. </note> <lb/>
            with dissimilar reeds, represented, the one a fowler with bird­ <lb/>
            lime, and the other a fisherman with his hook. I also saw a <lb/>
            tame she-bear, wearing the dress of a woman, and carried in a <lb/>
            chair; an ape, too, with a plaited straw hat on its head, and <lb/>
            clothed with a Phrygian garment of saffron colour, carrying in <lb/>
            its hand a golden cup, and representing the shepherd Ganymede; <lb/>
            likewise an ass, on which wings were glued, and which walked <lb/>
            near a feeble old man ; so that you would certainly have said <lb/>
            that the one was Bellerophon, and the other Pegasus; but still <lb/>
            you would have enjoyed your laugh at both.</p>
          <p>Amid this merry masquerade of the swarming people, the <lb/>
            procession proper of the guardian Goddess now advanced. <lb/>
            Females, splendidly arrayed in white garments, expressing <lb/>
            their joy by various gestures, and adorned with vernal chaplets, <lb/>
            scattered flowers on the ground from their bosoms, along the <lb/>
            path of the sacred procession. Others, again, with mirrors <lb/>
            placed upon their backs, showed all who followed to the God­ <lb/>
            dess, with their faces towards her as if they were coming to <lb/>
            meet her. Others, carrying ivory combs, imitated the combing <lb/>
            and bedecking of her regal hair, with the motion of their arms, <lb/>
            and the twisting of their fingers. There were others, too, who <lb/>
            sprinkled the streets with drops of genial balsam, and other <lb/>
            kinds of perfume. In addition to all this, there was a great <lb/>
            multitude of men and women, who propitiated the Goddess, <lb/>
            offspring of the celestial stars, by bearing lamps, torches, wax- <lb/>
            tapers, and other kinds of artificial light. Next came musicians, <lb/>
            playing sweetly on pipes and flutes. A graceful choir of chosen <lb/>
            youths, in snow-white garments, followed them, repeating a <lb/>
            beautiful song, which an excellent poet had composed under <lb/>
            favour of the Muses, the words of which explained the first <lb/>
            origin of the votive procession. Pipers also, consecrated to the <lb/>
            great Serapis, played an air appropriate to the worship of the <lb/>
            god, on pipes with transverse mouth-pieces, and tubes held ob­ <lb/>
            liquely towards their right ears. There were, also, a number <lb/>
            of persons, whose office it was to give notice that room should <lb/>
            be left for the sacred procession to pass. Then came a multi­ <lb/>
            tude of those who had been initiated into the sacred rites of <lb/>
            the goddess, consisting of men and women of all classes and <lb/>
            ages, resplendent with the pure whiteness of their linen gar­ <lb/>
            ments. The women had their anointed hair enveloped in a <lb/>
            transparent covering; but the men had shaven and shining <lb/>
             <pb n="230"/>
            pates ; earthly stars were these of extreme sanctity, who kept <lb/>
            up a shrill and incessant tinkling upon brazen, silver, and even <lb/>
            gold sistra. But the chief ministers of the sacred rites, clothed <lb/>
            in garments of white linen, drawn close over the breast, and <lb/>
            hanging down to their feet, carried the insignia of the mighty <lb/>
            Gods, exposed full to view. The first held aloft a brilliant <lb/>
            lamp, not by any means resembling those lamps of ours which <lb/>
            illumine banquets at night; but it was of gold, of a boat-like <lb/>
            form, and emitted a flame of considerable magnitude, from an <lb/>
            aperture in the middle. The second was arrayed in a similar <lb/>
            manner, but carried in both his hands models of altars, * to <lb/>
            which the auxiliary providence of the supreme goddess gave <lb/>
            the appropriate name of auxilia." The third bore a palm <lb/>
            tree, the leaves of which were beautifully wrought in gold, as <lb/>
            also the caduceus of Mercury. The fourth displayed the sym­ <lb/>
            bol of Equity, a left hand, fashioned with the palm expanded ; <lb/>
            which seems to be more adapted to administering Equity than <lb/>
            the right, from its natural inertness, and its being endowed <lb/>
            with no craft and no subtlety. The same person also carried a <lb/>
            golden vessel, which was rounded in the shape of the female <lb/>
            breast, and from which he poured forth milk on the ground. <lb/>
            The fifth bore a golden corn-fan, made with thickset branches <lb/>
            of gold ; while another carried an amphora.</p>
          <p>In the next place, appeared the gods that deigned to walk <lb/>
            with the feet of men. Here, dreadful to view, was the mes­ <lb/>
            senger of the gods above, and of those of the realms beneath, <lb/>
            standing erect, with a face partly black, and partly of a golden <lb/>
            hue, bearing in his left hand a caduceus, and shaking in his <lb/>
            right a green branch of palm ; close upon whose footsteps fol­ <lb/>
            lowed a cow, in an erect position ; this cow being the prolific <lb/>
            resemblance of the all-parent goddess, and seated on the shoul­ <lb/>
            ders of one of the blessed devotees of this divinity, who acted <lb/>
            gesticulatingly as he walked. Another carried a chest, con­ <lb/>
            taining the secret utensils of this stupendous mystery. Another <lb/>
            bore in his beatified bosom a venerable effigy of his supreme <lb/>
            Divinity, bearing no resemblance to any bird or beast, wild or <lb/>
            tame, or even to man; but worthy of all veneration for the <lb/>
            exquisite art with which it was wrought, as also for its very <note type="footnote"> * Models of altars ]-These altars (altaria) were symbols of the aid <lb/>
            afforded by Isis; and hence Apuleius says, they were called auxilia.- <lb/>
            Taylor. </note> <pb n="231"/>
            <note type="margin"> BOOK XI. </note> <lb/>
            originality, and an ineffable symbol of a sublime religion, the <lb/>
            mysteries of which were ever to be kept in deep silence. It <lb/>
            was of burnished gold, after the following manner: there was <lb/>
            a small urn, hollowed out in a most artistic manner, with a <lb/>
            bottom quite round, and which outside was covered with the <lb/>
            wonderful hieroglyphics of the Egyptians. The spout of this <lb/>
            urn was very long, not much elevated; a handle was attached <lb/>
            to the other side, and projected from the urn with a wide <lb/>
            sweep. On this lay an asp, uplifting its scaly, wrinkled, and <lb/>
            swollen throat, and embraced it with its winding folds.</p>
          <p>At last the moment was at hand, when I was to experience <lb/>
            the blessing promised me by the most potent goddess; and the <lb/>
            priest, attired just as she had described, approached with the <lb/>
            . means of my deliverance. In his right hand he carried the <lb/>
            sistrum of the goddess, and a crown of roses ; and by Hercules, <lb/>
            a crown it was for me; since by the providence of the mighty <lb/>
            goddess, after having endured so many hardships, and escaped <lb/>
            so many dangers, I should now achieve a victory over my cruel <lb/>
            enemy, Fortune.</p>
          <p>Still, however, though agitated by a sudden burst of joy, I <lb/>
            did not rush forward at once, lest the tranquil order of the <lb/>
            sacred procession should be disturbed by the impetuosity of a <lb/>
            quadruped; but passed through the crowd with a quiet and <lb/>
            altogether human step, and a sidelong movement of my body, <lb/>
            and as the people gave way, through the interference, no doubt, <lb/>
            of the goddess, I gradually crept nearer and nearer. But the <lb/>
            priest, as I could plainly perceive, recollecting the nocturnal <lb/>
            oracle, and struck with wonder at the coincidence with the <lb/>
            duty which he had been commanded to perform, instantly stood <lb/>
            still, and extending his right hand of his own accord, presented <lb/>
            the chaplet to my very mouth. Trembling, and with a great <lb/>
            beating of my heart, I seized the bright rosy chaplet, and <lb/>
            greedily, most greedily devoured it.</p>
          <p>Nor did the celestial promise deceive me; for immediately <lb/>
            my unsightly and brutal figure left me. First of all, my rough <lb/>
            hair fell off, and next my thick skin became thin; my big belly <lb/>
            shrank in; my hoofs spread out into feet and toes; my hands <lb/>
            were no longer feet, but ready for the duties of their elevated <lb/>
            position, My long neck was shortened; my face and my head <lb/>
            became round; my enormous ears were restored to their former <lb/>
            small dimensions; my stony teeth returned to the diminutive <lb/>
             <pb n="232"/>
            size of those of men; and the tail, which before especially <lb/>
            annoyed me, was no where to be seen. The people were as­ <lb/>
            tonished, and the religious adored the power of the supreme <lb/>
            Divinity, so manifested in the facility of my restoration, which <lb/>
            resembled the visions of a dream. Extending their hands to­ <lb/>
            wards the heavens, they attested, with a loud and unanimous <lb/>
            voice, the favour of the goddess thus signally displayed.</p>
          <p>As for me, I stood riveted to the spot in excessive asto­ <lb/>
            nishment, my mind being unable to contain a delight so sudden <lb/>
            and so great, quite at a loss what first and in especial to say, <lb/>
            how to make a commencement with a new voice, how most <lb/>
            auspiciously to prepare my address, my tongue being now born <lb/>
            • again, and in what words sufficiently to express my thanks to a <lb/>
            Goddess so great. The priest, however, who through the <lb/>
            divine admonition knew all my misfortunes from the beginning, <lb/>
            though he himself also was in a state of utter astonishment at <lb/>
            this remarkable miracle, at once signified his wish by nodding <lb/>
            his head, and ordered that a linen garment should be given <lb/>
            me, for the purpose of covering my nakedness. For, the very <lb/>
            instant that the ass had laid aside his abominable covering, I <lb/>
            carefully shaded myself with a natural screen, as much as it was <lb/>
            possible for a naked person to do, by closely compressing my <lb/>
            thighs, and applying my hands. Upon this one of the throng <lb/>
            of devotees promptly throwing me his upper tunic, covered <lb/>
            me therewith; which being done, the priest with a benign <lb/>
            countenance, and, by Hercules, astonished at my perfectly <lb/>
            human appearance, thus addressed me:—</p>
          <p>" At last, Lucius, you have arrived at the haven of peace <lb/>
            and the altar of mercy, after the many and various hardships <lb/>
            you have undergone, and all the buffetings of stormy Fortune. <lb/>
            Neither the nobility of your descent, nor your dignified posi­ <lb/>
            tion, nor even the learning in which you excel, have benefited <lb/>
            you in the slightest degree; but falling into the slavery of <lb/>
            pleasure, in the wantonness of buxom youth, you have reaped <lb/>
            the inauspicious reward of your ill-fated curiosity. Never­ <lb/>
            theless, blind Fortune, while harassing you with the worst of <lb/>
            dangers, has conducted you, in her short-sighted malice, to <lb/>
            this state of religious beatitude. Let her go now, and rage <lb/>
            with all her fury, and let her seek some other object for <lb/>
            her cruelty ;* for direful calamity has no power over those <note type="footnote">* Let her go now, —Thispassage—' Eat nunc, et summo furore </note> <pb n="233"/>
            <note type="margin"> BOOK XI. </note> <lb/>
            whose lives the majesty of our Goddess has claimed for <lb/>
            her own service. What advantage has unscrupulous For­ <lb/>
            tune derived from the robbers, from the wild beasts, from the <lb/>
            servitude, from the long toils on rugged roads, and from the <lb/>
            fear of death to which you were daily exposed? You are <lb/>
            now received under the guardianship of Fortune, but of a For­ <lb/>
            tune who can see, and who even illuminates the other Deities <lb/>
            with the splendour of her light. Assume henceforth a more <lb/>
            joyous countenance, such as befits that white garment which <lb/>
            you wear. Follow the train of the Goddess your deliverer with <lb/>
            triumphant steps. Let the irreligious see, let them see and ac­ <lb/>
            knowledge their error. Behold now, Lucius, rejoicing in the <lb/>
            providence of great Isis, and freed from his former miseries, <lb/>
            triumphs over his destiny. Nevertheless, that you may be <lb/>
            more secure and better protected, enrol your name in this holy <lb/>
            militia, which you will hereafter rejoice to belong to; dedicate <lb/>
            yourself to the service of our religion, and voluntarily bend <lb/>
            your neck to the yoke of this ministry; for when you have <lb/>
            once begun to serve the Goddess, you will then in a still higher <lb/>
            degree enjoy the fruit of your, liberty."</p>
          <p>The worthy priest having uttered these words, while his <lb/>
            breath heaved with inspiration, concluded his address, and I <lb/>
            mingling with the throng of devotees, accompanied the pro­ <lb/>
            cession; an object of curiosity to the whole city. All pointed <lb/>
            at me with their fingers and heads, and said, " This day <lb/>
            has the august power of all mighty God restored that person to <lb/>
            the human form. Happy, by Hercules! and thrice blessed he, <lb/>
            to have merited, by the innocence and probity of his past life, <lb/>
            such special patronage of heaven; in that, being after a manner <lb/>
            born again, he is immediately affianced to the service of the <lb/>

            show that Lesage, when he composed Gil Bias, had in view the Metamor­ <lb/>

            her escape with the hero of the tale, being persons and events introduced <lb/>

          <p>While these remarks were being made, and amid the tumult <lb/>
            of their noisy congratulations, moving slowly on, we now ap­ <lb/>
            proached the sea-shore, and came to that very place where, on <lb/>
            the preceding day, I, while yet an ass, had laid me down. The <lb/>
            images of the Gods being there arranged in proper order, the <lb/>
            chief priest dedicated and consecrated to the Goddess a very <lb/>
            skilfully built ship, pictured all over with the curious hiero­ <lb/>
            glyphics of the Egyptians, after having most carefully purified <lb/>
            it with a lighted torch, an egg, and sulphur, while at the same <lb/>
            time his chaste lips poured forth solemn prayers. The shining <lb/>
            white sail of this auspicious bark bore an inscription in large <lb/>
            characters, which was a repetition of a vow that had been made <lb/>
            on shore for the prosperity of the convoy at this season of the re­ <lb/>
            commencement of navigation. Now the mast was raised, which <lb/>
            was a rounded pine tree, tall and well polished, and conspicuous <lb/>
            for the beauteous appearance of its head. The prow also was <lb/>
            turned in imitation of a goose's neck,* and covered with gold <lb/>
            leaf, the bark shone resplendently, while the whole of the <lb/>
            highly polished keel consisted of shining citron wood. All the <lb/>
            people, religious and profane, t vied with each other in heaping <lb/>
            together corn-fans laden with aromatics and other sacrificial <lb/>
            offerings, and poured upon the waves a libation of milk mixed <lb/>
            with other ingredients; until the ship, freighted with abundant <lb/>
            gifts and auspicious prayers, and let slip from the ropes that held <lb/>
            the anchor, put to sea with a serene breeze, which seemed to <lb/>
            have sprung up for her sake alone. And after she had pro­ <lb/>
            ceeded so far on her course that she could no longer be distin­ <lb/>
            guished by us, the bearers of the sacred things again took what <lb/>
            each had brought, and began joyfully to return to the temple, <lb/>
            in an orderly manner, and in the same form of procession in <lb/>
            which they had come.</p>
          <p>Now as soon as we arrived at the temple, the chief priest and <lb/>
            those who carried the sacred images, and those who had already <lb/>
            been initiated into the venerable mysteries, being admitted into <lb/>
            the sanctuary of the Goddess, deposited in the accustomed form <lb/>
            the breathing effigies.±+ Then, one of these, whom all of them <note type="footnote"> * A goose's neck.]—The goose is sacred to Isis.—Taylor. </note><note type="footnote"> t Religious and profane.]—The words are used in a sense nearly analo­ <lb/>

            sacred college, convoked together as to a council, uttered from a <lb/>
            high pulpit auspicious wishes, from a book in which was written: <lb/>
            —" To the great Prince, to the Senate, to theEquestrian order, <lb/>
            in naval matters and in ships, and all those who are subject to <lb/>
            our dominion ;" and then he pronounced in the Greek language, <lb/>
            and according to the Greek custom, the <foreign xml:lang="grc">Λαοις ἄϕεσις</foreign>, [the people <lb/>
            may depart.] to which the people responded with a clamour <lb/>
            which testified their general satisfaction. Then every one went <lb/>
            home, full of joy, carrying branches of olive, sweet herbs, and <lb/>
            garlands of flowers, and after kissing the feet of a silver image <lb/>
            of the Goddess, which stood on the steps of the temple. But my <lb/>
            feelings would not allow me to move so much as a nail's breadth <lb/>
            from that place; but wi th my eyes intently fastened on the image <lb/>
            of the Goddess, I recalled to memory my past misfortunes.</p>
          <p>Fleeting Fame, however, had not in the meantime let her <lb/>
            wings remain idle, but had immediately circulated in all direc­ <lb/>
            tions in my native country the adorable bounty of the provident <lb/>
            Goddess, and my own memorable adventures. Accordingly, my <lb/>
            domestics and servants, and those who were nearest to me <lb/>
            by blood, laying aside the sorrow with which they had been <lb/>
            afflicted at the false intelligence of my death, and elated with <lb/>
            this sudden joy, hastened forthwith to see me, who had been <lb/>
            divinely saved and brought back, as it were, from the shades <lb/>
            below, and they presented me with gifts of various kinds. <lb/>
            I, too, was delighted to see them, and returned them many <lb/>
            thanks for their handsome presents, and the more especially, <lb/>
            as my domestics had providently taken care to bring me what <lb/>
            would be abundantly sufficient in the way of clothes and <lb/>
            money. Having, therefore, spoken to each of them in such <lb/>
            manner as I was in duty bound to do, and related to them my <lb/>
            former sorrows and my present joyous prospects, I again re­ <lb/>
            turned to what was to me the greatest subject of delight, the <lb/>
            contemplation of the Goddess, and procured for myself a tem­ <lb/>
            porary habitation within the enclosure of the temple, constantly <lb/>
            taking part in the private services of the Goddess, and being <lb/>
            inseparable from the brotherhood of the priests, and a constant <note type="footnote"> Gods, fabricated by telestæ, or mystic operators, so as to become animated, <lb/>

             <pb n="236"/>
            adorer of the great Divinity. Nor did I pass a single night or <lb/>
            ever close my eyes without some vision from this Divinity, in <lb/>
            which she commanded me to be now initiated in her sacred <lb/>
            mysteries, to which I had long since been destined. As for <lb/>
            me, though prompted by eager inclination, I was still restrained <lb/>
            by religious fear. For after diligent enquiry, I had found that <lb/>
            the requirements of a religious life were full of difficulties; <lb/>
            that the chastity required was a very difficult thing to observe, <lb/>
            and that it needed extreme circumspection to preserve such a <lb/>
            habit of life from casual defilements. Frequently pondering <lb/>
            over these things, I somehow or other delayed being initiated, <lb/>
            although hastening to that conclusion.</p>
          <p>One night I had a dream, in which I thought that the chief <lb/>
            priest made his appearance, and presented to me his lap full of <lb/>
            various things, and on my asking what they were, he answered <lb/>
            me, that the things had been sent to me from Thessaly; for <lb/>
            that a servant of mine, whose name was Candidus, had arrived <lb/>
            from that province. When I awoke, I revolved in my mind <lb/>
            over and over again what the vision portended, especially as I <lb/>
            was certain that I never had any servant who was called by <lb/>
            that name. Still, however, I believed that some profitable <lb/>
            result was undoubtedly signified by the priest offering me the <lb/>
            things. Thus, in a state of anxious and bewildered eagerness, <lb/>
            I awaited the opening of the temple in the morning. The white <lb/>
            curtains having been drawn aside, we prayed to the venerable <lb/>
            presence of the Goddess; and the priest going round the altars, <lb/>
            performed the sacred ceremonial with solemn supplications, <lb/>
            and poured forth libations from a chalice of water drawn from <lb/>
            a fountain in the precincts of the sanctuary. The sacred rites <lb/>
            therefore, being now duly performed, the devotees, saluting <lb/>
            the breaking dawn, in a loud voice announced tho first hour of <lb/>
            the day.</p>
          <p>And now, behold! some servants arrived from my country <lb/>
            whom I had left there at the time when Fotis, by her unfortu­ <lb/>
            nate mistake, had fitted me for a halter; so recognizing them as <lb/>
            my own servants, and finding that they had brought back that <lb/>
            horse of mine, after it had been sold from place to place, and <lb/>
            which I identified by a mark on its back; I was then especially <lb/>
            struck with admiration at the fitness of my dream, because not <lb/>
            only had it come true with respect to the gain it had promised, <lb/>
            but it had also predicted to me the recovery of my horse, which <pb n="237"/>
            <note type="margin"> BOOK XI. </note> <lb/>
            was of a white colour, under the designation of my servant <lb/>
            Candidus.</p>
          <p>I continued to apply myself wholly to attendance on the <lb/>
            worship of the Goddess, perceiving that the hopes which I <lb/>
            had conceived of future good were now confirmed by present <lb/>
            benefits. And besides, my desire of receiving initiation in the <lb/>
            sacred duties, increased daily more and more. Accordingly, I <lb/>
            frequently went to the chief priest, and most earnestly en­ <lb/>
            treated him to initiate me into the mysteries of the holy night; <lb/>
            but he, who was a man of a grave disposition, and remarkable <lb/>
            for his strict observance of that abstemious religion, checked <lb/>
            my urgent importunity in a mild and gentle manner, and in <lb/>
            the way in which parents are in the habit of moderating the <lb/>
            inconsiderate requests of their children, while at the same time <lb/>
            he soothed me with hopes for the better. For he said, that the <lb/>
            day on which each aspirant might be initiated was indicated <lb/>
            by tokens from the Goddess, and that by her providence the <lb/>
            priest was selected who was to perform the sacred rites; <lb/>
            and that in like manner by her mandate the expense necessary <lb/>
            for the ceremonial was ordained. All these circumstances, he <lb/>
            was of opinion, ought to be awaited with obsequious patience, <lb/>
            since we ought, on every consideration, to avoid precipitation <lb/>
            and contumacy, and neither be dilatory when called, nor pre­ <lb/>
            cipitate when not called. Nor, indeed, was there a single one <lb/>
            of their number who was so lost to a sense of propriety, or <lb/>
            rather so bent on his own destruction, as to dare rashly and <lb/>
            sacrilegiously to undertake the ministry of the Goddess, and <lb/>
            so bring upon himself a deadly mischance, unless she especially <lb/>
            ordered him so to do ; for the gates of the realms beneath, and <lb/>
            the guardianship of life, are placed in the hands of the God­ <lb/>
            dess, and the initiation into her mysteries is celebrated as <lb/>
            bearing a close resemblance to a voluntary death, with a pre­ <lb/>
            carious chance of recovery. Wherefore the divine will of the <lb/>
            Goddess has been accustomed to choose for this purpose men <lb/>
            who, having arrived at a great age, are now standing at the <lb/>
            very utmost limit of life, to whom, however, the mighty secrets <lb/>
            of her religion may be safely entrusted,* and whom, through <lb/>
            her providence, being after a manner born again, she restores <note type="footnote"> * To whom, however, ]—That is to say, who are not yet so infirm <lb/>
            and imbecile as to be incapable of preserving secrecy. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="238"/>
            to the career of a new existence. Therefore it was requisite <lb/>
            that I should await the celestial mandate, although by the clear <lb/>
            and manifest favour of the great Deity I had already been <lb/>
            marked and destined for her blessed ministry; and I ought <lb/>
            thenceforth to abstain from profane and forbidden food, in com­ <lb/>
            mon with the other devotees, in order that I might with the <lb/>
            most scrupulous strictness proceed on my course to the secret <lb/>
            mysteries of the most pure religion.</p>
          <p>Thus did the priest express himself, nor was my compliance <lb/>
            interrupted by feelings of impatience; but I attentively per­ <lb/>
            formed the daily duties of the sacred ministry, intent upon <lb/>
            maintaining a calm demeanour and laudable silence. Nor did <lb/>
            the salutary benevolence of the powerful goddess disappoint <lb/>
            me, or torment me with a long delay; but she clearly admo­ <lb/>
            nished me by no obscure mandates in the darksome night, <lb/>
            that the day was now arrived that had always been the object <lb/>
            of my desire, .and in which she would put me in possession of <lb/>
            my extreme wishes. She also stated what sum of money <lb/>
            would be requisite for the expenses of the ceremonial, and at <lb/>
            the same time appointed for me, as the dispenser of the rites, <lb/>
            the same Mithras, her own high priest, who, she said, was <lb/>
            united to me by a certain conjunction of the stars.</p>
          <p>Refreshed in mind by these and other benevolent precepts <lb/>
            of the supreme Goddess, and shaking off slumber, though it <lb/>
            was not yet clear day, I hastened at once to the dwelling of the <lb/>
            priest, and saluted him just as he was coming .out of his bed- <lb/>
            chamber. I had now determined to request more earnestly <lb/>
            than ever initiation into the sacred rites, as being a thing that <lb/>
            was due to me. He, however, the instant that he saw me, <lb/>
            was the first to speak: "0 my Lucius, how happy and blessed <lb/>
            are you, whom the august divinity has thus greatly honoured <lb/>
            by her propitious will! And why," said he, "do you now <lb/>
            stand idle, or make any delay? The day you so earnestly <lb/>
            prayed for has now arrived, in which you will be initiated into <lb/>
            the most holy mysteries by these hands of mine, in obedience <lb/>
            to the divine mandates of the many-titled Goddess."</p>
          <p>And the old man, taking me by the right hand, led me im­ <lb/>
            mediately to the doors of the vast temple; and having performed <lb/>
            the office of opening them in the accustomed solemn way, and <lb/>
            celebrated the morning sacrifice, he drew forth from the secret <lb/>
            recesses of the shrine certain books, written in unknown cha- <pb n="239"/>
            <note type="margin"> BOOK XI. </note> <lb/>
            racters, partly representing in compendious form the words ex­ <lb/>
            pressive of their meaning by figures of animals of every kind, <lb/>
            and partly fortified against the inquisitive perusal of the pro­ <lb/>
            fane, by characters wreathed like knots, and twisting round in <lb/>
            shape of a wheel, and with extremities twining one with an­ <lb/>
            other, like the tendrils of a vine. From these books he in­ <lb/>
            formed me what was necessary to be provided by me for the <lb/>
            purpose of initiation.</p>
          <p>Immediately, therefore, I diligently set about purchasing <lb/>
            and procuring requisites, and even on a more liberal scale than <lb/>
            I was ordered to do, partly at my own expense, and partly <lb/>
            through my friends. And when, now the time, as the priest <lb/>
            said, required it, he led me to the nearest bath, accompanied <lb/>
            by a crowd of devotees ; and after I had taken the customary <lb/>
            bath, he himself washed and sprinkled me with the purest <lb/>
            water, having first implored the pardon of the Gods. Then, <lb/>
            again, he brought me back to the temple, and there placed me <lb/>
            at the very feet of the Goddess, two-thirds of the day having <lb/>
            now elapsed ; and giving certain secret instructions, which are <lb/>
            too holy to be uttered, he distinctly ordered, before all who <lb/>
            were present, that I should abstain from luxurious food for the <lb/>
            ten succeeding days, and that I should eat the flesh of no <lb/>
            animal, and should abstain from wine.</p>
          <p>These ten days having been duly passed by me in reverential <lb/>
            abstinence, the day had now arrived for pledging myself to the <lb/>
            sacred ministry, and the sun descending, was ushering in the <lb/>
            evening. Then, behold, there was a concourse of the people <lb/>
            flocking from every side, every one honouring me with various <lb/>
            gifts, according to the ancient custom of these sacred rites. <lb/>
            After this, the priest, all the profane being removed to a dis­ <lb/>
            tance, taking hold of me by the hand, brought me into the inner <lb/>
            recesses of the sanctuary itself, clothed in a new linen gar­ <lb/>
            ment. Perhaps, curious reader, you may be eager to know <lb/>
            what was then said and done ? I would tell you, were it lawful <lb/>
            for me to tell you; you should know it, if it were lawful for <lb/>
            you to hear. But both the ears that heard these things, and <lb/>
            the tongue that told them, would reap the evil results of their <lb/>
            rashness. Still, however, kept in suspense as you probably <lb/>
            are with religious longing, I will not torment you with long- <lb/>
            protracted anxiety. Hear, therefore, but believe what is the <lb/>
            truth. I approached the confines of death, and having trod <lb/>
             <pb n="240"/>
            on the threshold of Proserpine, I returned therefrom, being <lb/>
            borne through all the elements. At midnight I saw the <lb/>
            sun shining with its brilliant light; and I approached the <lb/>
            presence of the Gods beneath, and the Gods of heaven, and <lb/>
            stood near, and worshipped them. Behold, I have related to <lb/>
            you things of which, though heard of by you, you must ne­ <lb/>
            cessarily remain ignorant. I will therefore only relate that <lb/>
            which may be enunciated to the understanding of the un­ <lb/>
            initiated without a crime.</p>
          <p>The morning came, and, the solemnities being performed, I <lb/>
            came forth consecrated by being dressed in twelve stoles, an <lb/>
            habiliment no doubt of most religious character, but of which <lb/>
            I am not forbidden by any obligation to speak, because it was <lb/>
            seen by many who were present on the occasion. For, by order <lb/>
            of the priest, I ascended a wooden pulpit, which was in the <lb/>
            very middle of the sacred dwelling, and placed before the image <lb/>
            of the Goddess, 'full in view, in a garment which was of linen, <lb/>
            but elegantly coloured. A precious scarf also descended from <lb/>
            my shoulders behind my back down to my ankles, and to <lb/>
            whatever part of me you directed your view, you would have <lb/>
            seen something to arrest your attention in the animals which <lb/>
            were painted round my vestment in various colours. Here were <lb/>
            Indian serpents, there Hyperborean griffins, which the other <lb/>
            hemisphere generates in the form of a bird wearing wings. <lb/>
            The persons devoted to the service of the divinity call this the <lb/>
            Olympic stole. Then, in my right hand I carried a burning <lb/>
            torch; while a graceful chaplet encircled my head, the shining <lb/>
            leaves of the palm tree projecting from it like rays of light. <lb/>
            Thus arrayed like the sun, and placed so as to resemble a <lb/>
            statue, on a sudden, the curtains being drawn aside, I was ex­ <lb/>
            posed to the gaze of the multitude. After this, I celebrated <lb/>
            the most joyful day of my initiation, as my natal day, and <lb/>
            there was a joyous banquet and mirthful conversation. The <lb/>
            third day also was celebrated with the like rites and cere­ <lb/>
            monies, and was accompanied by a religious breakfast, and the <lb/>
            due termination of the ceremonial. After this, having stayed <lb/>
            for some days in that place, I enjoyed the inexplicable pleasure <lb/>
            of viewing the holy image, being indebted to it for a benefit <lb/>
            which can never be sufficiently rewarded. At length, how­ <lb/>
            ever, through the admonition of the Goddess, having suppli­ <lb/>
            antly given her thanks, not such as she deserved, but still, to <pb n="241"/>
            <note type="margin"> BOOK XI. </note> <lb/>
            the best of my ability, I prepared myself, though very slowly, <lb/>
            to return home.</p>
          <p>With difficulty did I rend asunder the ties of my most ardent <lb/>
            affection. At last I prostrated myself in the presence of the <lb/>
            Goddess, and having for a long time watered her feet with my <lb/>
            tears, interrupting my words by frequent sobs, and, as it were, <lb/>
            half swallowing my voice, I thus addressed her:—“ Thou, <lb/>
            0 holy and perpetual preserver of the human race, always <lb/>
            munificent in cherishing mortals, dost bestow the sweet affec­ <lb/>
            tion of a mother on the misfortunes of the wretched. Nor is <lb/>
            there any day or night, nor so much as the minutest particle <lb/>
            of time, which passes unattended by thy bounties. Thou dost <lb/>
            protect men both by sea and land, and, dispersing the storms <lb/>
            of life, dost extend thy health-giving right hand, by which <lb/>
            thou dost unravel the inextricably entangled threads of the <lb/>
            Fates, and dost assuage the tempests of fortune, and restrain <lb/>
            the malignant influences of the stars. The gods of heaven <lb/>
            adore thee, those in the shades below do homage unto thee; <lb/>
            thou dost roll the sphere of the universe round the steady poles, <lb/>
            thou dost illuminate the sun, thou dost govern the universe, <lb/>
            thou dost tread the realms of Tartarus. The stars move re­ <lb/>
            sponsive to thy command, the Gods rejoice in thy divinity, the <lb/>
            seasons return by thy appointment, and the elements are thy <lb/>
            servants. At thy nod the breezes blow, the clouds are nur­ <lb/>
            tured, the seeds germinate, and the blossoms increase. The <lb/>
            birds as they hover through the air, the wild beasts as they <lb/>
            roam on the mountains, the serpents that hide in the earth, <lb/>
            and the monsters that swim in the sea, are terrified at the ma­ <lb/>
            jesty of thy presence. But I, so weak in capacity for cele­ <lb/>
            brating thy praises, and possessing such slender means for <lb/>
            offering sacrifices, have far from eloquence sufficient to express <lb/>
            all that I conceive of thy majesty; not a thousand mouths, and <lb/>
            tongues as many, not an eternal flow of unwearied speech, <lb/>
            would be equal to the task. I will, therefore, use my utmost <lb/>
            endeavours to do what, poor as I am, still one truly religious <lb/>
            may do—I will figure to myself thy divine countenance, and <lb/>
            will ever preserve this most holy divinity locked up in the <lb/>
            deepest recesses of my breast."</p>
          <p>After this manner, having offered up my prayer to the <lb/>
            supreme Goddess, I embraced the priest Mithras, who was now <lb/>
            my parent, and hanging on his neck, and giving him many <note type="footnote"> R </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="242"/>
            kisses, I begged him to forgive me, that I could not remunerate <lb/>
            him in a manner adequate to such mighty benefits. At length, <lb/>
            after having been long engaged in giving him thanks, I de­ <lb/>
            parted, and prepared to journey directly to my paternal abode, <lb/>
            in order to revisit it after an absence so prolonged. A few <lb/>
            days after, having hastily tied up my packages, through the <lb/>
            admonition of the powerful Goddess, embarking on board a <lb/>
            ship, I set sail for Rome. Being sure of a favourable wind <lb/>
            during my voyage, I very speedily entered into port, and tra­ <lb/>
            velling by chariot* with the greatest rapidity, arrived at the <lb/>
            holy city, † on the day before the Ides of December in the <lb/>
            evening. Thenceforward no study was there of such primary <lb/>
            importance with me, as that of daily supplicating the supreme <lb/>
            divinity of Queen Isis; who is there propitiated with the <lb/>
            greatest veneration under the name of Campensis,‡ which ap­ <lb/>
            pellation she derives from the situation of her temple. In fine, <lb/>
            I became a constant worshipper, a foreigner indeed as to her <lb/>
            temple, but indigenous as to her religion.§</p>
          <p>Behold the mighty sun, having passed through the sign- <lb/>
            bearing circle of the zodiac, had completed the year, when the <lb/>
            vigilant care of the beneficent Goddess again interrupted my <lb/>
            sleep, and again reminded me of initiation and sacred rites. <lb/>
            On this I wondered what object she had in view, and what future <lb/>
            event she announced. For how could I do otherwise ? as I <lb/>
            considered myself to have been most fully initiated already.</p>
          <p>While, therefore, I revolved my religious doubts in my own <note type="footnote"> * By chariot.]—There are instances among the ancients of extraor­ <lb/>
            dinary celerity in travelling. Alexander, to suppress the rebellion of the <lb/>
            Arici, travelled with his army six hundred stadia in two days, i. e. each day <lb/>
            seventy-two miles. Julius Cæsar used to travel commonly one hundred <lb/>
            Roman miles in a day, as we are informed by Suetonius. Curio, according <lb/>
            to Appian, travelled with Caesar's letters three thousand three hundred <lb/>
            stadia in three days, i. e. three hundred and seventy-seven English miles. <lb/>
            And Tiberius Nero, as we are informed by Pliny, travelled with three <lb/>
            chaises in one day and one night, a journey of two hundred miles to see <lb/>
            his brother when he was sick.—Taylor. </note><note type="footnote"> t The holy city.]—Rome, which was considered to be the seat of the <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> BOOK XI. </note> <lb/>
            mind, and availed myself of the counsels of the priest, I as­ <lb/>
            certained a thing that was novel and quite wonderful to me; <lb/>
            that I was only inititated into the mysteries of the goddess, <lb/>
            but that I had not yet been admitted to the knowledge of <lb/>
            the rites of the great God, and supreme parent of the <lb/>
            Gods, the invincible Osiris. For though the essence of their <lb/>
            divine nature and religion is connected, or rather, is tran­ <lb/>
            scendently united, nevertheless, there is a very considerable <lb/>
            difference in the initiations into their mysteries. Hence, it <lb/>
            was for me to know that I was called upon by the great God to <lb/>
            become one of his servants. Nor did the matter long remain am­ <lb/>
            biguous. For on the following night, I saw in a dream one of <lb/>
            the devotees, who, clothed in linen garments, and bearing in his <lb/>
            hands thyrsi and ivy, and certain other things which I am not <lb/>
            permitted to mention, placed them before my household Gods, <lb/>
            and then seating himself in my chair, announced to me that I <lb/>
            must prepare a plentiful religious banquet. He also walked <lb/>
            gently with a hesitating step, the ancle of his left foot being <lb/>
            slightly bent, in order no doubt that he might afford me some <lb/>
            sign, by which I might recognize him. All the mists of am­ <lb/>
            biguity were therefore removed, after such a manifest declara. <lb/>
            tion of the will of the gods.</p>
          <p>Accordingly, the instant I had performed the morning salu­ <lb/>
            tations to the goddess, I made a most careful examination of <lb/>
            each, to see whether there was any one of the priests resem­ <lb/>
            bling him whom I had seen in the dream. Nor was he wanting. <lb/>
            For I immediately beheld one of the Pastophori, exactly cor­ <lb/>
            responding with the nocturnal vision, not only' with regard to <lb/>
            the mark of his foot. but also in his stature and general ap­ <lb/>
            pearance ; whose name I afterwards learnt to be Asinius Mar­ <lb/>
            cellus, an appellation not without some degree of reference* to <lb/>
            my transformation. Without delay, therefore, I addressed <lb/>
            this priest, who was himself very far from ignorant of what I <lb/>
            intended to say, because he had already been admonished by a <lb/>
            similar mandate, that he should initiate me into the mysteries <lb/>
            of Osiris. For on the preceding night, while he was placing <lb/>
            chaplets on the statue of the great God, he imagined that he <lb/>
            had also heard from that mouth of his by which he pronounces <lb/>
            the destinies of all things, that he should send to him a native <note type="footnote"> * Some reference.]—For between Asinus, an ass, into which he had <lb/>
            been changed, and Asinius, there is a great resemblance. </note> <note type="footnote"> R 2</note> <lb/>
             <pb n="244"/>
            of Madaura, to whom, though he was very poor, he must im­ <lb/>
            mediately impart the sacred mysteries. That, through his pro­ <lb/>
            vidence, glory would accrue to that person from his religious <lb/>
            exercises, and great profit for himself.</p>
          <p>After this manner, being affianced to the sacred mysteries, <lb/>
            I was retarded, contrary to my inclination, by reason of the <lb/>
            slenderness of my means. For the expense to which I had <lb/>
            been put in my journey had frittered away the small substance <lb/>
            of my property; and the sums I was obliged to expend in the <lb/>
            city, exceeded those which had been disbursed in the provinces. <lb/>
            Rigid poverty, consequently, greatly interfering with my <lb/>
            wishes, I was much afflicted, being placed, as the old proverb <lb/>
            says, between the altar and the stone. * Nor yet was I less <lb/>
            urged from time to time by the present mandates of the God. <lb/>
            At last, after being repeatedly reminded, and finally com­ <lb/>
            manded, not without considerable perturbation, taking off my <lb/>
            back my garment, small as it was, I scraped together a suf­ <lb/>
            ficient sum. And this very thing I had been expressly com­ <lb/>
            manded to do. For the God said to me, " Would you hesitate <lb/>
            in the least to part with your garments, if you were attempting <lb/>
            to procure any thing which might administer to your pleasures ? <lb/>
            and are you now, when you are going to enter upon so great a <lb/>
            ceremonial, doubtful whether you shall commit yourself to a <lb/>
            poverty of which you will never have to repent?"</p>
          <p>All things, therefore, being abundantly prepared, again being <lb/>
            satisfied for ten days with other than animal food, and besides <lb/>
            this, being also admitted to the nocturnal orgies of Serapis, <lb/>
            a god of the first rank, I now applied myself to the service of <lb/>
            the god, full of that confidence which my knowledge of a kin­ <lb/>
            dred ritual produced. This event afforded me the greatest <lb/>
            consolation for my sojourn in a foreign country, and at the <lb/>
            same time supplied me more plentifully with the means of sub­ <lb/>
            sistence. For, under favour of the deity of Good Event, I sup­ <lb/>
            ported myself on a little gain which I made in the forum <lb/>
            by pleading causes in the Latin tongue.</p>
          <p>A short time after, I was again addressed by the unexpected <note type="footnote"> * Between the altar and the stone.]—Equivalent to the modern phrase, <lb/>
            ' between the hammer and the anvil.' The proverb is derived from the <lb/>
            ancient manner of ratifying a covenant, in which the priest killed a pig <lb/>
            with a blow of a stone, exclaiming, ' May Jupiter smite him who breaks <lb/>
            this covenant, as I smite this pig.' </note> <pb n="245"/>
            <note type="margin"> BOOK XI. </note> <lb/>
            and perfectly miraculous mandates of the gods, and was com­ <lb/>
            pelled to undergo a third initiation.* This caused me no <lb/>
            slight anxiety, and much was I perplexed to know what could <lb/>
            be the meaning of this new and unusual expression of the will <lb/>
            of the gods; and what could still remain to be added by way <lb/>
            of supplement to an initiation that had been already twice re­ <lb/>
            peated. Surely, thought I, both the priests have advised me <lb/>
            either wrongly or less fully than they ought to have done. <lb/>
            And, by Hercules, I now began even to entertain a bad opinion <lb/>
            of their fidelity. While, however, I was thus fluctuating amid <lb/>
            a stormy tide of thought, and agitated to the verge of insanity, <lb/>
            the benevolent figure of the divinity instructed me by a noc­ <lb/>
            turnal vision. "There is no reason," said he, "that you should <lb/>
            be terrified by the repeated series of religious rites, as if any <lb/>
            thing had been previously omitted; but you ought rather ex­ <lb/>
            ceedingly to rejoice on account of these reiterated marks of <lb/>
            favour on the part of the divinities, and to exult that you will <lb/>
            thrice obtain that which is scarcely even once granted to others. <lb/>
            And you may confidently believe from that number that you <lb/>
            will always be blessed. Besides, you will find that this cere­ <lb/>
            monial is most necessary for you, if you will only now consider <lb/>
            with yourself, that the stole of the goddess with which you <lb/>
            were invested in the province, still remains deposited in the <lb/>
            same spot, and that you cannot so much as supplicate at Home <lb/>
            on solemn days in a garment of this kind, or be ennobled by <lb/>
            that auspicious apparel, when you are commanded to assume <lb/>
            it. In order, then, that you may enjoy health, happiness, and <lb/>
            prosperity, once again with joyous feelings be initiated in the <lb/>
            sacred mysteries, the mighty gods being your advisers."</p>
          <p>Thus far did the persuasive majesty of the hallowed vision <lb/>
            announce to me what was requisite to be done. Nor did I, <lb/>
            after this, neglect the matter, or defer it; but immediately <lb/>
            relating what I had seen to my priest, I forthwith submitted <lb/>
            to the yoke of abstinence from animal food, and having of my <lb/>
            own accord extended my abstinence beyond those ten days <lb/>
            prescribed by a perpetual law, I bought what was requisite <lb/>
            for my initiation, spending more largely from pious zeal than <lb/>
            with reference to the measure of the things provided. Nor, <lb/>
            by Hercules, did I at all repent of my trouble and expense. <note type="footnote"> * A third initiation.]—This third initiation was into the mysteries ot <lb/>
            the Roman Isis, as the first was into those of the Achaian Isis.—Taylor. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="246"/>
            And why should I ? for by the bounteous providence of the <lb/>
            gods, I was sufficiently enriched -by my forensic emoluments. <lb/>
            At length, after a very few days had elapsed, the God Osiris, <lb/>
            who is the chief of the great gods, the highest among the <lb/>
            greatest, the greatest among the highest, and the ruler of the <lb/>
            greatest, not now veiling himself under some figure other than <lb/>
            his own, but deigning to address me in his own person, and in <lb/>
            his own divine words, seemed in my sleep to declare, that I <lb/>
            should forthwith become renowned through my pleading causes <lb/>
            in the forum, and that I should not fear the slanders of the <lb/>
            malevolent, to which the learning I had acquired by laborious <lb/>
            study had rendered me liable.</p>
          <p>Besides this, in order that I might minister to his sacred <lb/>
            rites, mingling with the throng of devotees, he chose me to be <lb/>
            a member of the college of his Pastophori, and still more, to <lb/>
            be one of the quinquennial Decurions. Finally, therefore, my <lb/>
            hair being closely shaved off, I joyfully fulfilled the duties of <lb/>
            that most ancient college, which had been established in the <lb/>
            days of Sylla, not shading or covering my baldness, but freely <lb/>
            exposing it to the public gaze, whithersoever I went.</p>

          <p>MAXIMUS CLAUDIUS, and you who are sitting here in judgment,* <lb/>
            I felt fully assured, that Sicinius Æmilianus, † an old man, <lb/>
            notorious for audacity, would, for want of substantial charges, <lb/>
            fill up with nothing but abuse the accusation he undertook to <lb/>
            make against me, before he had well considered the matter. <lb/>
            Now any innocent person may be accused, but no one can be <lb/>
            proved guilty unless he is so. Relying especially on this con­ <lb/>
            sideration, by the Gods of heaven! I do rejoice that, with you <lb/>
            for my judge, the power and the opportunity have fallen to <lb/>
            my lot, of exculpating Philosophy in the eyes of the ignorant, <lb/>
            and defending myself.</p>
          <p>And yet these charges- serious-looking charges at first <lb/>
            new-were made with a suddenness that tended to embarrass <lb/>
            my defence. For, as you remember, five or six days ago, when <lb/>
            I was beginning to plead the cause of my wife,‡ Pudentilla, <lb/>
            against the Granii, the advocates of this Æmilianus, by a con­ <lb/>
            certed plan, and at a moment when I least expected it, assailed <lb/>
            me with abuse, and accused me of magical practices, and even <lb/>
            of the death of my step-son Pontianus. As I saw that these <lb/>
            were not so much charges brought forward for judicial en­ <lb/>
            quiry, as imputations for the mere purpose of abuse, I chal­ <lb/>
            lenged them of my own accord, urgently and repeatedly, to <note type="footnote"> * Injudgment.]—As assessors to Maximus Claudius, the proconsul of <lb/>

             <pb n="248"/>
            prefer their accusation. But then Æmilianus, seeing that you <lb/>
            too, Maximus, were considerably moved, and that a judicial <lb/>
            affair had arisen out of his words, began, in distrust of his <lb/>
            cause, to look about for some subterfuge from the consequences <lb/>
            of his temerity.</p>
          <p>Accordingly, when he, who shortly before had been crying <lb/>
            out that Pontianus, his brother's son, had been murdered by <lb/>
            me, was compelled to sign his name to the accusation, he in­ <lb/>
            stantly forgot all about the death of his young kinsman, and all <lb/>
            of a sudden was mute as to the specification of a crime of such <lb/>
            extreme atrocity. Still, that he might not seem altogether <lb/>
            to have abandoned his charges, he selected this accusation <lb/>
            of magical practices-an accusation more easily made than <lb/>
            proved-as the only one in which he should persist. And even <lb/>
            that he did not dare do openly; but, on the day after, he <lb/>
            gave in an indictment, in the name of my son-in-law, Sicinius <lb/>
            Pudens, a mere boy, and annexed his own name thereto as his <lb/>
            supporter ; thus adopting a new fashion of making an attack <lb/>
            in another's name; no doubt, in order that, by putting for­ <lb/>
            ward one so young, he himself might be screened from due <lb/>
            punishment for his false accusation. When you, with great <lb/>
            sagacity, perceived this to be the case, and thereupon com­ <lb/>
            manded him again to support in his own name the accusation <lb/>
            he had originally made, he promised that he would ; but after <lb/>
            all, he could not be prevailed upon to do so. While you are <lb/>
            urging him to come to close action with me, he, in his contu­ <lb/>
            macy, shoots his calumnious missiles even against yourself. <lb/>
            Thus ever shunning the danger of making an open accusation, <lb/>
            he persevered in the safe course of seconding it.</p>
          <p>Accordingly, before the trial had even commenced, it was <lb/>
            easy for any one to understand what would be the nature of the <lb/>
            prosecution, the framer and contriver of which feared to under­ <lb/>
            take its responsibility. This was more especially the case, <lb/>
            since the person in question was Sicinius Æmilianus; who, <lb/>
            if he had ascertained anything substantial against me, would <lb/>
            certainly never have manifested any such hesitation in im­ <lb/>
            peaching one who was a stranger to himself, of crimes so <lb/>
            numerous and so heinous-he who, well knowing that his <lb/>
            uncle's will was genuine, denounced it as a forgery; and with <lb/>
            such obstinacy, that when Lollius Urbicus, the pro-consul, with <lb/>
            men of consular dignity sitting as his assessors, had pronounced <lb/>
             <pb n="249"/>
            that it was proved genuine, and ought to be held valid, still <lb/>
            that madman persisted, with his voice raised to the loudest <lb/>
            pitch, in swearing that the will was a forgery; so that Lol­ <lb/>
            lius Urbicus hardly refrained from visiting him with capital <lb/>
            punishment. Relying on your justice and my own innocence, <lb/>
            I trust that on this trial also he will have occasion to burst <lb/>
            forth into exclamations of a similar nature. For he knowingly <lb/>
            accuses one who is innocent; and does so, no doubt, with the <lb/>
            greater readiness, because, as I have said, he has already, on a <lb/>
            trial of the greatest importance, been convicted of uttering <lb/>
            falsehoods before the Prætor of the city.</p>
          <p>For, as after having once committed a fault, every good <lb/>
            man is the more careful to avoid it; so one who is evil-dis­ <lb/>
            posed repeats his offence with increased audacity; and, from <lb/>
            that time forward, the more frequently he offends, the more <lb/>
            undisguisedly he does so. For it is with shame as with a gar­ <lb/>
            ment—the more it is worn, the less it is cared for.</p>
          <p>For this reason, then, I deem it necessary, in order to main­ <lb/>
            tain the integrity of my character, to refute all his malevolent <lb/>
            aspersions before I come to the main charge. For I am un­ <lb/>
            dertaking not only my own defence, but that of philosophy <lb/>
            also, whose high character spurns the least slur as though <lb/>
            it were the weightiest of charges; for as much as the ad­ <lb/>
            vocates of Æmilianus have been just now babbling forth with <lb/>
            their mercenary loquacity, many things trumped up against <lb/>
            myself individually, and many others that are commonly ut­ <lb/>
            tered by the ignorant against philosophers in general. Now, <lb/>
            although it may be manifest that these charges arc gabbled <lb/>
            by them, in order to gain their fees, and to earn a premium <lb/>
            for their impudence, according to a sort of usage now univer­ <lb/>
            sally established among pettifogging pleaders of this sort-a <lb/>
            race who are in the habit of letting out the venom of their <lb/>
            viperous tongues to give pain to others-still, even for my <lb/>
            own sake, they must be briefly rebutted; lest I, who am exert­ <lb/>
            ing all ray energies, that I may not appear to admit of any <lb/>
            stain or any blemish upon my character, might seem to some, <lb/>
            in case I should pass by any of these frivolous charges, rather <lb/>
            to have admitted them than to have held them in contempt.</p>
          <p>For, according to my way of thinking, it is the part of a <lb/>
            modest and honorable spirit to be incensed even by a false <lb/>
            accusation; seeing that even those who are conscious to them­ <lb/>
             <pb n="250"/>
            selves of the commission of any offence, are still greatly <lb/>
            excited and angered by reproach ; although from the very <lb/>
            moment that they began to do wrong, they may have been <lb/>
            accustomed to hear themselves ill-spoken of. Nay, even if <lb/>
            silence is observed by others, they are still fully conscious <lb/>
            that they may with justice be censured. On the other hand, <lb/>
            every man who is virtuous and without guile, whose ears are <lb/>
            utterly unused to the language of obloquy, and who, from re­ <lb/>
            peatedly hearing himself praised, is unprepared for reproach, is <lb/>
            the more grieved at heart on hearing those things said un­ <lb/>
            deservedly against him, which he could with truth allege <lb/>
            against others. If then, perchance, I shall appear disposed to <lb/>
            defend myself against charges that are absurd and utterly <lb/>
            frivolous, that circumstance ought, in fairness, to be imputed <lb/>
            as a fault to those who are disgraced by having even uttered <lb/>
            them against me; and no blame ought to attach to me, in <lb/>
            whom it will be becoming to have refuted even such things.</p>
          <p>You heard, then, a short time since, at the commencement <lb/>
            of the accusation, words to the following effect: "We accuse <lb/>
            before you a handsome philosopher, and a man of distinguished <lb/>
            eloquence,”—oh, monstrous!—“ both in the Greek and in the <lb/>
            Latin tongues." For, unless I am mistaken, it was in these <lb/>
            self-same words that Tannonius Pudens, a man most certainly <lb/>
            not of distinguished eloquence, commenced his harangue against <lb/>
            me. How I wish he had good grounds for making such <lb/>
            weighty charges against me—of being possessed of good looks <lb/>
            and of eloquence—I should have had no difficultv in answer. <lb/>
            ing him, as Paris does Hector, in Homer :* <lb/>
            " Man may not reject <lb/>
            The glorious bounty by the Gods bestowed, <lb/>
            Nor follows their beneficence our choice."</p>
          <p>Such would have been my answer to the charge of goo.l <lb/>
            looks: and I would have told him besides, that it has been <lb/>
            deemed allowable even for philosophers to be of graceful ap­ <lb/>
            pearance ; I would have shown that Pythagoras, who was the <lb/>
            first to call himself a philosopher, was the handsomest person of <lb/>
            his age; that Zeno, of ancient times, the native of Elea, he <lb/>
            who was the first of all, with truly critical skill, to divide <lb/>
            speech into two departments,† that this same Zeno, too, Was, <note type="footnote"> * In Homer.]—Iliad, III. 65, 66. </note><note type="footnote"> t Into two departments.]—Rhetoric and dialectics, or logic. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="251"/>
            as Plato affirms, most remarkable for the graces of his person. <lb/>
            I would also have told him that many other philosophers have <lb/>
            been handed down to memory as most remarkable for the <lb/>
            beauty of their features, and who have set off the graces of <lb/>
            their persons by the virtues of their lives.</p>
          <p>This mode of defence, however, as I have already observed, <lb/>
            but ill becomes me; for, whereas naturally I had but small <lb/>
            pretensions to good looks, unremitting application to learned <lb/>
            labours has effaced from me all comeliness, has made me thin, <lb/>
            dried up my natural juices, expunged my healthy colour, and <lb/>
            impaired my vigour. This hair, which they, with falsehood <lb/>
            so manifest, affirmed that I had allowed to grow to such a <lb/>
            length, in order to add to the allurements of my beauty—you <lb/>
            see how far it is from being handsome and neatly arranged- <lb/>
            all clogged and matted together, like a rope of twisted tow, <lb/>
            shaggy and uneven, lumped and felted; its knots inextricable <lb/>
            through prolonged neglect, not only of combing, but even of <lb/>
            disentangling and separating it. The charge, then, as to my <lb/>
            hair, which they have made as it were a capital count in <lb/>
            the indictment, has, I fancy, been sufficiently refuted.</p>
          <p>And then, as to eloquence, if I had been possessed of any, <lb/>
            it ought not to appear surprising, or a ground for envy, if, <lb/>
            after devoting myself, with all my energies, from my earliest <lb/>
            years up to the present moment, to the cultivation of litera­ <lb/>
            ture alone, in contempt of all other pleasures, I had succeeded <lb/>
            in acquiring it, after expending upon it an amount of labour, <lb/>
            by night and by day, exceeding, probably, that employed by <lb/>
            any other man, and at the cost of a total disregard and sacrifice <lb/>
            of my health. However, let them stand in no fear of my <lb/>
            eloquence, an accomplishment which I am rather in hopes <lb/>
            of acquiring, than able to display at present, if, indeed, I have <lb/>
            made any progress at all.</p>
          <p>And yet, if the words are true which Statius Cæcilius is <lb/>
            said to have written in his poems, that " Innocence is elo­ <lb/>
            quence," then, on that principle, I am ready to admit, and I do <lb/>
            boldly assert, that in eloquence I will yield the palm to no <lb/>
            man whatever. For, taking this view, what man living is <lb/>
            there more eloquent than myself, who have never so much as <lb/>
            entertained a thought to which I did not dare give utterance ?* <note type="footnote"> * Give utterance ?]—He plays upon the resemblance of the words </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="252"/>
            I affirm, that I am most truly eloquent, for all guiltiness I <lb/>
            have ever esteemed as a thing not to be named; I affirm that <lb/>
            I am most ready in argument, for no deed or saying of mine <lb/>
            is there which I am not able, before all the world, by argu­ <lb/>
            ment to support. For instance, I will now take up the argu­ <lb/>
            ment with reference to the lines, which they put forward as <lb/>
            compositions of mine, of which I ought to be ashamed ; when <lb/>
            you saw me smiling at them in scorn, because they delivered <lb/>
            them in so uncouth and illiterate a manner.</p>
          <p>In the first place, then, they read out of my book of jokes,* <lb/>
            a short letter, the subject of which was dentifrices; this was <lb/>
            written in verse, to one Calpurnianus, who, no doubt, when he <lb/>
            produced that letter against me, did not perceive, in his eager­ <lb/>
            ness to injure me, that if there was anything criminal in it, <lb/>
            he himself was affected thereby in an equal degree with me. <lb/>
            Now, that he had asked me for something to be used for the <lb/>
            purpose of cleaning his teeth, the lines themselves bear wit­ <lb/>
            ness- <lb/>
            " In hurried verse, I bid Calpurnian hail. <lb/>
            I've sent, as you required, the dentifrice, <lb/>
            Arabian produce, brightener of the mouth, <lb/>
            A fine choice powder, a rare whitener, <lb/>
            A soother of the swollen tender gums, <lb/>
            A cleaner-out of scraps of yesterday; <lb/>
            That no unsightly blemish may be seen, <lb/>
            If you should chance with opened lips to laugh."</p>
          <p>And now, pray, what do these lines contain, in meaning or <lb/>
            in language, that I should at all be ashamed of ? What is there <lb/>
            that a philosopher should be at all unwilling to acknowledge <lb/>
            as his own composition ? Unless, perchance, I was deserving of <lb/>
            reprehension for sending to Calpurnianus a powder made of <lb/>
            Arabian drugs, seeing that he was a person who might have <lb/>
            with much more propriety, after the filthy manner of the Ibe­ <lb/>
            rians, <lb/>
            " With his own water washed his teeth and rusty gums," <lb/>
            as Catullus says. <note type="footnote"> ‘ eloquens' and ' eloquor,' 'facundus' and ' nefas,' * disertus ’ and ' dis- <lb/>
            sero;’ but his meaning cannot be easily expressed in English. </note><note type="footnote"> * Book of jokes.]—Called ' Ludicra.' This book is lost, with the <lb/>
            exception of one line, besides those found here. It probably consisted of <lb/>
            jests and amatory stories. </note> <pb n="253"/>
            </p>
          <p>I perceived just now some who could hardly controul his <lb/>
            laughter, when the orator inveighed with such asperity against <lb/>
            cleaning of the teeth, and pronounced the word " dentifrice" <lb/>
            with more indignation than any body else would speak of <lb/>
            poison. And why should he not ? No doubt it is a crime <lb/>
            not to be overlooked in a philosopher, if he is particular in <lb/>
            his precautions against dirt; if he allows no part of his body <lb/>
            that is exposed to view to be unclean and filthy, the mouth <lb/>
            especially, which man makes frequent use of openly and con­ <lb/>
            spicuously : whether he kisses another, or discourses on any <lb/>
            subject, or lectures before an audience, or repeats his prayers <lb/>
            in a temple. For so it is that words precede every act of <lb/>
            mankind ; words which, as the first of poets says, issue forth <lb/>
            from “the hedge* of the teeth." If you could at the present <lb/>
            day produce any one gifted with powers of utterance so grand <lb/>
            as those with which he was endowed, he would declare in his <lb/>
            usual manner, that from him above all men who has any care <lb/>
            for the art of speaking, the mouth requires more sedulous at­ <lb/>
            tention than all the rest of the body, seeing that it is the vesti­ <lb/>
            bule of the mind, the gateway of speech, and the outer court <lb/>
            of the thoughts.</p>
          <p>At all events, according to my way of thinking, I should <lb/>
            say that nothing so ill becomes a man who is of free birth <lb/>
            and liberal education as inattention to the appearance of <lb/>
            the mouth. For this portion of the person is elevated in <lb/>
            position, exposed full in view, and in continual use. On <lb/>
            the other hand, with wild beasts and cattle the mouth is low- <lb/>
            seated, and brought down on a level with the legs; it lies <lb/>
            close to the feet and to the grass on which they feed, and is <lb/>
            scarcely ever to be seen but when they are dead, or in a state <lb/>
            of exasperation and ready to bite; whereas you look upon no <lb/>
            feature before this in a man while he is silent,-no one more <lb/>
            frequently while he is in the act of speaking. I only wish, <lb/>
            now, that my censor, AEmilianus, would answer me this <lb/>
            question: whether he is ever in the habit of washing his feet, <lb/>
            or whether, if he does not deny the fact, he would contend <lb/>
            that greater care ought to be bestowed upon the cleanliness of <lb/>
            the feet than of the teeth ? If, indeed, a person, like yourself, <lb/>
            Æmilianus, will hardly ever open his mouth except to utter <note type="footnote"> * The hedge.]—He alludes to the expression <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐρκος ὀδόντων</foreign>, fre­ <lb/>
            quently found in Homer. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="254"/>
            calumnies and revilings, I am clearly of opinion that he ought <lb/>
            to bestow no attention whatever on his mouth, nor to clean <lb/>
            his teeth with powders brought from abroad, when he might <lb/>
            much more appropriately rub them with charcoal snatched from <lb/>
            the funeral pile; and that he ought not so much as to rinse <lb/>
            them with common water.</p>
          <p>On the contrary, let his malignant tongue, the caterer of <lb/>
            falsehoods and of bitter abuse, for ever lie amid the stench <lb/>
            and foulness which so well become it. For how, in the name <lb/>
            of misfortune, is it consistent with reason that one should have <lb/>
            a clean and purified tongue, and at the same time a loath­ <lb/>
            some and offensive voice ? that he should, like the viper, instil <lb/>
            black venom from teeth white as snow ? On the other hand, <lb/>
            in the case of him who knows he is going to utter language* <lb/>
            that is neither, inappropriate nor unpleasing, it is with good <lb/>
            reason that his mouth is washed beforehand, just like a cup <lb/>
            when it is prepared for containing a pleasant draught.</p>
          <p>But why enlarge any further upon this topic, with regard to <lb/>
            mankind ? That huge beast, the crocodile, which is produced <lb/>
            in the Nile, even it, as I am informed, opens wide its jaws, <lb/>
            and, without inflicting injury, allows its teeth to be cleansed. <lb/>
            For as it has an immense mouth and no tongue, and generally <lb/>
            lies concealed beneath the water, numbers of leeches fasten <lb/>
            about its teeth ; wherefore it repairs to the banks of the river, <lb/>
            and opens its mouth, and one of the river birds, a friend <lb/>
            to it, thrusts in her beak and picks its teeth, without in­ <lb/>
            curring any risk.</p>
          <p>No more of this. I now come to the rest of these love verses, <lb/>
            as they style them; but which they read in such harsh and <lb/>
            uncouth tones, as rather to provoke hatred.</p>
          <p>But really, what has it to do with magical practices, if I <lb/>
            did celebrate in verse the children of my friend Scribonius ? <lb/>
            Am I of necessity a magician, because I am a poet ? Who <lb/>
            ever heard tell of a suspicion like this, a conjecture so happy, <lb/>
            an argument so convincing ? "Apuleius has composed verses <lb/>
            if they were bad ones, it is a fault, no doubt, but then it is not <lb/>
            the fault of the philosopher, but of the poet. If, on the other <lb/>
            hand, they were good ones, on what grounds do you accuse <lb/>
            him? " But then," say you, "he composed verses of a jocu- <note type="footnote"> a, Utter language.]—‘ Orationem' seems a preferable reading to ‘ rati- <lb/>
            onem.’ </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="255"/>
            lar and amorous character." Is this, then, your charge against <lb/>
            me, and did you make a mistake in the name, when you ac­ <lb/>
            cused me of practising magic ? And yet other persons have <lb/>
            done the same: among the Greeks (if you are not aware of <lb/>
            the fact), a Teian, a Lacedæmonian, a Ceian, * and innumerable <lb/>
            others; a woman, too, a native of Lesbos, t wrote in wanton <lb/>
            numbers, and with such gracefulness, as to reconcile us to the <lb/>
            strangeness of her dialect by the sweetness of her lines; then, <lb/>
            among ourselves, AEdituus, and Portius, and Catullus, and <lb/>
            others without number.</p>
          <p>" But these were not philosophers," you say. Will you <lb/>
            go so far, pray, as to deny that Solon was a man of serious <lb/>
            habits and a philosopher ? and yet he was the composer of <lb/>
            that most wanton line, <lb/>
            " Desirous of her thighs and honeyed mouth." <lb/>
            Now what is there in all my verses put together, to be com­ <lb/>
            pared in lasciviousness of expression with this one line ? not <lb/>
            to say a word about the writings of Diogenes, the cynic, and <lb/>
            of Zeno, the founder of the sect of the Stoics ? I will now <lb/>
            read some of my lines over again, that they may understand <lb/>
            that I am not ashamed of them. <lb/>
            “ Thou, Critias, art my bosom's joy; <lb/>
            Charinus too, my sun-bright boy, <lb/>
            Thy portion in my love's the same; <lb/>
            I burn for both with equal flame. <lb/>
            And fear ye not-this double fire <lb/>
            I'll bear, to win my soul's desire. <lb/>
            Let me by both be'looked upon <lb/>
            As by himself is each dear one; <lb/>
            Look on me thus, and you shall be <lb/>
            As precious as two eyes to me."</p>
          <p>And now I will read the other ones, which they read the last <lb/>
            of all, as though they were of surpassing indecency. <lb/>
            " Garlands and song I weave for thy sweet sake; <lb/>
            This for thyself; those let thy Genius take : <lb/>

          <p>Here, then, Maximus, you have the charge against Info <lb/>
            founded upon garlands and songs, just as though I were some <lb/>
            wanton reveller. You also observed, that this, too, was made <lb/>
            a charge against me, that whereas the youths are called by <lb/>
            other names, I have given them those of Charinus and Critias. <lb/>
            Why, upon similar grounds, they might accuse Catullus, for <lb/>
            calling Clodia Lesbia; and just in the same way, Ticida, be­ <lb/>
            cause he wrote Pærilla, whereas the lady's name was Metella ; <lb/>
            Propertius too, who speaks of Cynthia, but means Hostia; and <lb/>
            Tibullus, who had Plania in his thoughts, while Delia was <lb/>
            named in his lines. For my own part, although C. Lucilius <lb/>
            was a poet who wrote Iambic lines, I should still consider him <lb/>
            worthy of censure, because he openly defamed the youths <lb/>
            Gentilis and Macedo in his lines under their own names. How <lb/>
            much more beseemingly does Virgil, the poet of Mantua, act, <lb/>
            who, just as I have done, when praising the son of his friend <lb/>
            Pollio, in his sportive Bucolics, refrains from making mention <lb/>
            of names, and calls himself Corydon, and the youth Alexis.*</p>
          <p>But Æmilianus, more of a clownish churl than any of the <lb/>
            shepherds and herdsmen of Yirgil, a man who will ever be a <lb/>
            bumpkin and a barbarian, while he flatters himself that he is <lb/>
            of more rigid morals than your Serrani, Curii, or Fabricii <lb/>
            avers that this kind of composition does not befit a Platonic <lb/>
            philosopher. And will you still persist in affirming this, <lb/>
            Æmilianus, if I shew that these lines have been composed <lb/>
            after a precedent afforded us by Plato himself, of whose com­ <lb/>
            position there are no verses in existence, except some elegiac <lb/>
            lines on Love; for all his other poems, I suppose because <lb/>
            they were not so elegant, he committed to the flames. Hear, <lb/>
            then, the verses of Plato the philosopher, to the boy Aster, <lb/>
            if indeed, at your time of life, you are still able to learr. <lb/>
            anything in the way of literature. <note type="footnote"> * The youth Alexis.]—He alludes to the Second Eclogue of Virgil. <lb/>

          <p>Why dost thou gaze upon the sky ? <lb/>
            Oh, that I were yon spangled sphere, <lb/>
            And every star should be an eye <lb/>
            To wander o'er thy beauties here. <lb/>
            In life thou wert my morning star ; <lb/>
            And now that death hath stol'n thy light. <lb/>
            Alas, thou shinest dim and far, <lb/>
            Like the pale beam that weeps at night."*</p>
          <p>Hear, also, the lines addressed by the same writer, Plato, to <lb/>
            the boys Alexis and Phædrus, where he addresses them in a <lb/>
            joint poem. <lb/>
            " Although I nothing said but this—‘ How fair <lb/>
            Alexis is,' all turn and gaze on thee. <lb/>
            My soul, why show to dogs a bone, and then <lb/>
            Torment them ? did we not lose Phœdrus thus ?"</p>
          <p>And, again; not to quote any more lines than these, I will <lb/>
            just repeat his last distich on Dion of Syracuse, and then make <lb/>
            an end. <lb/>
            " Thou sleep'st in honour on thy country's breast, <lb/>
            Dion, beloved of my extatic soul!"</p>
          <p>But really am I not acting absurdly, even to mention these <lb/>
            things in court ? and are you not rather acting the part of <lb/>
            calumniators, even to produce these matters as the grounds <lb/>
            of your accusation against me ? just as though, forsooth, it <lb/>
            were any proof of a man's mode of life, that he writes wanton <lb/>
            lines. Have you not read Catullus, where he thus replies to <lb/>
            the malevolent ? <lb/>
            “ 'Tis fit the worthy poet should be chaste- <lb/>
            There's no need that his verses should be so."</p>
          <p>The divine Adrian, when he honoured the tomb of his friend <lb/>
            the poet Voconius with his verse, wrote to this effect:— <lb/>
            " Wanton thou wast in verse, but chaste in mind <lb/>
            a thing he never would have said, if verses somewhat sprightly <lb/>
            were to be considered as indicative of pruriency of thought. <lb/>
            I recollect, too, having read many verses of a similar character <lb/>
            by the divine Adrian himself. Assert then, if you dare, Æmi­ <lb/>
            lianus, that it is evil to do that which the divine Adrian, our <lb/>
            emperor and censor, has done, and has handed down to memory <lb/>
            as having been done by him. Besides, do you suppose that <note type="footnote"> * Weeps at night.]—Translated by Thomas Moore. </note> <note type="footnote"> s </note> <lb/>

            Maximus is likely to censure anything that he knows I have <lb/>
            done after the example of Plato ? whose lines, which I just <lb/>
            now quoted, are the more chaste for being undisguised, the <lb/>
            more modest for their plainness of expression. For, to dissemble <lb/>
            and to conceal these and all such matters, is the part of an <lb/>
            offender, while, to discourse of them openly and without dis­ <lb/>
            guise, is the part of him who speaks but in jest; for so it is, <lb/>
            that by nature the power of utterance has been given to in­ <lb/>
            nocence, while silence has been allotted to criminality.</p>
          <p>But I will forbear to enlarge upon those deep and holy <lb/>
            mysteries of the Platonic philosophy, which, while they are <lb/>
            revealed to but few of the pious, are totally unknown to <lb/>
            all the profane ; how, that Venus is a twofold goddess, each <lb/>
            of the pair producing a peculiar passion, and in different kinds <lb/>
            of lovers One of them is the “ Vulgar," who is prompted by <lb/>
            the ordinary passion of love, to stimulate not only the human <lb/>
            feelings, but even those of cattle and wild beasts, to lust, and <lb/>
            commit the enslaved bodies of beings thus smitten by- her to <lb/>
            immoderate and furious embraces. The other is the "Heavenly" <lb/>
            Venus, who presides over the purest love, who cares for men <lb/>
            alone and but few of them, and who influences her devotees by <lb/>
            no stimulants or allurements to base desire. For the love that <lb/>
            is engendered by her is not a wanton or lascivious love, but, on <lb/>
            the contrary, it is serious and unadorned, and allures its votaries <lb/>
            to virtue by its own intrinsic beauty; and if at any time <lb/>
            she does commend a graceful form, she scrupulously protects <lb/>
            it against all cause for reproach. Nor, indeed, is there any­ <lb/>
            thing else in the beauty of the person deserving of love, beyond <lb/>
            the fact that it recalls to the mind which took its origin in Deity, <lb/>
            that beauty which in all its truth and purity it once beheld <lb/>
            among the gods. Hence it is, that Afranius, with his usual <lb/>
            eloquence, has left this line :— <lb/>
            " Where wise men love, all others will desire."</p>
          <p>However, Æmilianus, if you wish to hear the truth, or if <lb/>
            you can ever arrive at a perception of the fact, the wise man <lb/>
            does not so much love, as recall to mind.* Do pardon, then, <lb/>
            the philosopher Plato, for his verses on love, that I may not <note type="footnote"> 4 Recall to mind.]—The beauty of which it was sensible, when in a <lb/>

            feel myself necessitated, contrary to the maxim of Neoptolemus <lb/>
            in Ennius,* to "philosophize in detail;" or, at all events, if <lb/>
            you decline to do so, I will readily submit, with reference to <lb/>
            verses of this nature, to be censured in company with Plato. <lb/>
            And to you, Maximus, I return abundant thanks, for having <lb/>
            so attentively listened to these appendages to my defence, which <lb/>
            I have deemed necessary, inasmuch as they are put forward in <lb/>
            answer to charges brought against me; and for the same reason <lb/>
            I request that you, will listen as readily and as attentively as <lb/>
            you have hitherto done, to what I have to say, before I come <lb/>
            to the main charges.</p>
          <p>For next follows the lengthy and cutting attack about the <lb/>
            looking-glass, upon which, Pudens, screaming aloud, commen­ <lb/>
            surately with the atrocity of the offence, almost burst him­ <lb/>
            self, crying, " a philosopher has a looking-glass !-a philoso­ <lb/>
            pher possesses a looking-glass !" Let me then confess that I <lb/>
            have one, lest you should flatter yourself that you had hit me <lb/>
            hard if I denied it; but it is by no means a necessary infer­ <lb/>
            ence, that I am in the habit of dressing too before a looking- <lb/>
            glass. For suppose I were in possession of a theatrical ward­ <lb/>
            robe, would you argue thence that I was in the habit of using <lb/>
            the long train of the tragedian, the saffron-coloured dress of <lb/>
            the comedian, or the little mantle of the mimic, as at the <lb/>
            triennial orgies of Bacchus ? You would not, I think. And on <lb/>
            the other hand, there is many a thing of which I am. not pos­ <lb/>
            sessed, but of which I still enjoy the use.</p>
          <p>If, then, the possession of a thing is no proof of the use of <lb/>
            it, or the non-possession of the non-use of it, and if not so <lb/>
            much the possession of a looking-glass is censured by you, as <lb/>
            the looking into it, it then necessarily follows, that you must <lb/>
            shew when and in whose presence I looked into the glass; <lb/>
            for, according to the present state of the case, you make it <lb/>
            a greater offence for a philosopher to look into a looking- <lb/>
            glass, than for one of the uninitiated to pry into† the mysteries <lb/>
            of Ceres. <note type="footnote"> * In Ennius.]—We iearn from Aulus. Gellius,.that the maxim here <lb/>
            alluded to was, ‘ we ought to philosophize concisely, for to do so in de­ <lb/>
            tail is not pleasant." Ennius was one of the oldest of the Latin poets. </note><note type="footnote"> t To pry into.— He alludes to the baskets or boxes which were carried <lb/>

            </p>
          <p>Come now, even if I should confess that I have looked into <lb/>
            it, pray what crime is it to be acquainted with one's own <lb/>
            features, and to have their image not put up* in one fixed <lb/>
            spot, but to carry it about in a little mirror, ready to be sur­ <lb/>
            veyed wherever you please ? Are you ignorant that there is <lb/>
            nothing more deserving to be viewed by a man than his own <lb/>
            features ? For my part, I know that those sons are the mos <lb/>
            beloved who bear the strongest resemblance to the parents <lb/>
            and that a man's own statue is erected at the public expense <lb/>
            in his honour as the reward of merit, in order that he may <lb/>
            look upon the same ; else what is the use of statues and images <lb/>
            thus framed with the varied resources of art ? unless, perchance, <lb/>
            we admit that the very same thing that is worthy of admi­ <lb/>
            ration. when produced by artistic skill, is to be deemed cul­ <lb/>
            pable when presented by nature; whereas, on the contrary, <lb/>
            the readiness and exactness of nature are even still more de­ <lb/>
            serving of our admiration. For in tracing all likenesses by <lb/>
            the hand, a considerable time is consumed in the work, and <lb/>
            yet, after all, no resemblance is to be seen comparable with <lb/>
            that to be viewed in a mirror; for clay is deficient in vigour, <lb/>
            stone in colour, painting in firmness, while all are devoid of <lb/>
            the power of motion, which brings the likeness before us in' <lb/>
            the highest degree.</p>
          <p>For in . the mirror is to be seen the image wonderfully re­ <lb/>
            flected, not only with the resemblance traced out, but en­ <lb/>
            dowed, too, with motion, and obedient to every gesture of the <lb/>
            person whom it represents. Then, besides, it is always of <lb/>
            the same age with the beholder, from the earliest boyhood <lb/>
            down to the very close of old age: so many aspects of life <lb/>
            does it assume, of such varied conditions of the body does <lb/>
            it partake, such numerous changes of the same features, whether <lb/>
            influenced by joy or by grief, does it imitate. But, on the <lb/>
            other hand, the resemblance that is moulded from clay, formed <lb/>
            of molten brass, hewn out of stone, impressed by heat on wax, <lb/>
            laid on a surface with paint, or represented by any other re­ <lb/>
            source of human art, after no long interval of time becomes <lb/>
            quite unlike the original; and besides, it always preserves <lb/>
            the same rigid unmoved features, just like a corpse. To such <lb/>
            a degree then, does the highly-wrought smoothness of its po- <note type="footnote"> * Not put up.]—That is to say, in a portrait. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="261"/>
            lished surface, and artificial brightness of the mirror, surpass <lb/>
            all art in reflecting the likeness of the person.</p>
          <p>Either, then, we are bound to adhere to the opinion of <lb/>
            Agesilaus the Lacedæmonian, who having but a poor opinion <lb/>
            of his own appearance, would never allow himself to be re­ <lb/>
            presented in painting or sculpture, or else, if the usages of all <lb/>
            the rest of mankind appear worthy to be retained, and statues <lb/>
            and images are not to be eschewed, what reason have you to <lb/>
            be of opinion that each man ought to see his likeness rather <lb/>
            in stone than in silver, rather in a picture than in a mirror ? <lb/>
            Do you think it a disgrace for a man carefully to survey his <lb/>
            own figure ? Is it not said of the philosopher Socrates, that <lb/>
            he even advised his disciples to view themselves repeatedly in <lb/>
            a mirror, so that he among them who was smitten with his <lb/>
            own good looks, might be the more scrupulously careful not <lb/>
            to disgrace the beauty of his person by bad manners; while, <lb/>
            on the other hand, he who thought himself not so highly gifted <lb/>
            in appearance, might carefully use his best endeavours to screen <lb/>
            his ugliness by his virtues. And thus did a man, who was <lb/>
            wiser than all others, make use of the mirror for the purpose <lb/>
            even of improving moral cultivation.</p>
          <p>Then too, who knows not how Demosthenes, that most ex­ <lb/>
            cellent master in the art of oratory, always got up his causes <lb/>
            before a mirror, just as though in presence of a master ? So <lb/>
            that most excellent orator, after he had learned eloquence from <lb/>
            the philosopher Plato, and the art of reasoning from Eubulides <lb/>
            the logician, endeavoured to obtain the extreme perfection of <lb/>
            the art of oratory by the assistance of the mirror.</p>
          <p>Which, then, do you think ought to pay the greater atten­ <lb/>
            tion to grace in the impressive delivery of his language, the <lb/>
            wrangling rhetorician or the warning philosopher ? the one <lb/>
            who for a few moments disputes before certain judges who are <lb/>
            chosen by lot, or the one who is continually discussing ques­ <lb/>
            tions in the presence of all mankind; he who wrangles about <lb/>
            the limits of fields, or he who defines the limits of good and <lb/>
            evil ? Why, if it was only for this purpose, ought not a phi­ <lb/>
            losopher to look into a mirror ? For it is often incumbent upon <lb/>
            him not only to view his own likeness, but to consider too the <lb/>
            manner in which that likeness is so reflected; whether it is <lb/>
            that, as Epicurus says, images which emanate from our bodies <lb/>
            in a perpetual flow, being a kind of slough, as it were, as soon <lb/>
             <pb n="262"/>
            as they strike against any smooth and solid surface, are <lb/>
            thrown back again, and so turned the contrary way; or <lb/>
            whether it is that, as other philosophers argue, our rays of <lb/>
            vision, (whether flowing from the middle of the eyes, and <lb/>
            mingling and uniting with the external light as Plato thinks, <lb/>
            or whether only proceeding from the eyes without any foreign <lb/>
            admixture whatever, as Archytas supposes, or whether being <lb/>
            broken by the tension of the atmosphere, as the Stoics ima­ <lb/>
            gine), when they have struck upon any body that is dense, <lb/>
            smooth, and shining, rebound and return to the features at the <lb/>
            same angles of incidence at which they have struck that body, <lb/>
            and so represent in the mirror that which they touch and <lb/>
            behold externally to it. Does it not seem to you to be a <lb/>
            matter of duty that philosophers should investigate all these <lb/>
            subjects and duly enquire into them, and that they ought to <lb/>
            be the only persons to look into mirrors of all kinds, whether <lb/>
            with a watery surface or with a dry ? For their province <lb/>
            it is, besides what I have already mentioned, to enter upon <lb/>
            that other enquiry, why in mirrors with a plain surface images <lb/>
            generally appear alike, while in mirrors which are spherical and <lb/>
            convex in surface, all objects appear diminished, and, on the <lb/>
            other hand, in those which are concave they are magnified; <lb/>
            at what distance and for what reason before a concave mirror <lb/>
            the left hand takes the place of the right; in what cases it is <lb/>
            that the image at one moment withdraws within, and at ano­ <lb/>
            ther, seems to be stepping out* of the same mirror; why it <lb/>
            is that a concave mirror, if it is held facing the sun ignites fuel <lb/>
            placed close to it: how it happens that distinct rainbows are <lb/>
            seen in the clouds, and that two suns exactly similar are to <lb/>
            be beheld : besides numerous other questions of a similar na­ <lb/>
            ture, which are discussed in the ample volume of Archimedes <lb/>
            the Syracusan, a man endowed far beyond all other men with <lb/>
            a wonderful degree of skill in all geometrical subjects; though <lb/>
            I am not quite sure but he is worthy of especial note for the <lb/>
            fact that he consulted the mirror often and carefully. If you <lb/>
            had only been acquainted with his book, Æmilianus, and had <lb/>
            applied yourself not only to your fields and your clods, but to the <lb/>
            geometrician's board and fine sand, believe me, when I say it, <note type="footnote"> * Stepping out.]—He alludes to the appearance, on advancing the <lb/>
            finger or other portion of the body towards and withdrawing it from a <lb/>
            convex mirror. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="263"/>
            that although your extremely ugly features differ but very <lb/>
            little from those of the Thyestes of tragedy, there is no doubt <lb/>
            but you would have looked into the mirror with the object <lb/>
            of learning something new, and would at last have given up <lb/>
            the plough, in the intensity of your admiration of the numerous <lb/>
            furrows and wrinkles to be seen in your own face.</p>
          <p>Now, I should not wonder if you took it in very good part <lb/>
            that I make mention of those most distorted features of yours, <lb/>
            but am silent as to your manners, which are far more repulsive. <lb/>
            The fact is, that whereas I am not naturally of a quarrelsome <lb/>
            disposition, I was, moreover, quite willing until the last few <lb/>
            days, to remain in ignorance whether you were a white or <lb/>
            a black man, and even now, by Hercules! I am far from <lb/>
            certain on that point. This arises from the fact, that while <lb/>
            you have been buried in the obscurity of a country life, I <lb/>
            have been busied with my studies. So, while the shade <lb/>
            thrown around you by your ignoble condition has stood be­ <lb/>
            tween yourself and an observer, I have never made it my <lb/>
            object to learn the misdeeds of any person, but have always, <lb/>
            in preference, studied how to veil my own failings rather <lb/>
            than pry into those of others. I am just in the same position, <lb/>
            then, with reference to you, as the man who chances to be <lb/>
            standing in a place upon which a bright ligh is thrown, while <lb/>
            another, concealed in deep shade, is looking at him. For just <lb/>
            in a similar manner, while you can easily observe, in your <lb/>
            obscurity, what I am doing in the open daylight and before <lb/>
            all the world, you yourself, being concealed by your ignoble <lb/>
            station, and shunning the light, cannot in your turn be dis­ <lb/>
            tinguished by me.</p>
          <p>Hence it is, that whether you have slaves to till your lands, <lb/>
            or whether you make exchange of labour with your neighbours, <lb/>
            turn and turn about, I neither know nor am I anxious to <lb/>
            know ; but you know very well that in one day I manumitted <lb/>
            three slaves at Œa, * and this your advocate, among other <lb/>
            points upon which he had been instructed by you, made an <lb/>
            objection against me; although but very shortly before, he <lb/>
            had asserted that I had come to Œa with but a single ser­ <lb/>
            vant as my attendant. Now I wish you would answer me <lb/>
            this: out of one servant how could I manumit three, unless <note type="footnote"> * At Œa.]—A city of Africa, between the greater and the lesser <lb/>
            Syrtes. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="264"/>
            this, too, is to be set down to the account of magic ? Am I <lb/>
            to suppose that such is your blindness in lying, or such the <lb/>
            inveteracy of that habit in you ? " Apuleius came to (Ea with <lb/>
            a single servant," and then, after babbling out a few words, <lb/>
            " Apuleius manumitted three slaves at (Ea in one day." Why, <lb/>
            not even would your story have been credible, had you said <lb/>
            that I had come attended by three servants, and had liberated <lb/>
            them all; and yet if I had done so, why should you look <lb/>
            upon the possession of but three servants as a mark of poverty, <lb/>
            rather than the manumission of three as a proof of opulence ? <lb/>
            You know not, most decidedly you know not, Æmilianus, <lb/>
            how to bring a charge against a philosopher, when you throw <lb/>
            in my teeth the scantiness of my retinue, a thing that I ought <lb/>
            rather, for the sake of my own credit, to have feigned, had it <lb/>
            been necessary so to do, inasmuch as I was well aware that <lb/>
            not only the philosophers, of whom I profess to be a disciple, <lb/>
            but even emperors of the Roman people have gloried in the <lb/>
            small number of their servants.</p>
          <p>And have not your advocates, pray, read to the same effect ? <lb/>
            How that M. Antonius, a man of consular dignity, had but <lb/>
            eight servants in his house, and how that Carbo, who attained <lb/>
            the highest honours, had one less ? And then, again, how <lb/>
            Manius Curius, who was rendered so illustrious by his nume­ <lb/>
            rous victories, for three times did he enter at the same gate <lb/>
            in triumph, how that Manius Caius, I say, employed but two <lb/>
            camp servants in his expeditions ? So likewise the man who <lb/>
            triumphed over the Sabines, the Samnites, and Pyrrhus, had <lb/>
            fewer servants in. number than the triumphs he enjoyed. Then, <lb/>
            again, Marcus Cato, little expecting that others would mention <lb/>
            it of him, has left it written in a speech of his, that when he <lb/>
            set out as consul for Spain, he took with him from the city <lb/>
            but three attendants, and no more; when he arrived, how­ <lb/>
            ever, at the public villa,* these seemed too few for his re­ <lb/>
            quirements, whereupon he ordered two youths to be purchased <lb/>
            in the forum at the slaves' platform,† and these five he took <note type="footnote"> * Public villa.]—The ' publica villa' was a house of reception used by <lb/>
            the Roman people for the entertainment of foreign ambassadors, taking <lb/>
            the census, and other public purposes. </note><note type="footnote"> t Slaves' platform.]—‘ De mensa.' The I mensa' here alluded to was <lb/>
            a stone or platform on which the slaves stood when put up for sale by the <lb/>
            ‘ præco’ or ' auctioneer.' </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="265"/>
            with him to Spain. If Pudens had read all this, according <lb/>
            to my way of thinking he would either have entirely spared <lb/>
            this invective, or else in three servants he would have seen <lb/>
            cause rather to censure the multitude of a philosopher's attend­ <lb/>
            ants, than the scantiness of his retinue.</p>
          <p>He has even gone so far as to reproach me with my poverty, <lb/>
            a charge truly acceptable to a philosopher, and one to which <lb/>
            I readily plead guilty. For Poverty has long been the hand­ <lb/>
            maid of Philosophy, frugal, temperate, contented with little, <lb/>
            eager for praise, averse from the things sought by wealth, safe <lb/>
            in her ways, simple in her requirements, in her counsels a <lb/>
            promoter of what is right. No one has she ever puffed up <lb/>
            with pride, no one has she corrupted by the enjoyment of <lb/>
            power, no one has she maddened with tyrannical ambition; <lb/>
            for no pampering of the appetite or of the passions does she <lb/>
            sigh, nor can she indulge it.</p>
          <p>But it is your fosterlings of wealth who are in the habit of <lb/>
            perpetrating these disgraceful excesses and others of a kindred <lb/>
            nature. If you review all the greatest enormities that have <lb/>
            been committed in the memory of mankind, you will not find <lb/>
            a single poor man among the perpetrators: whilst, on the <lb/>
            other hand, in the number of illustrious men, hardly any of <lb/>
            the rich are to be found; poverty has nurtured from his very <lb/>
            cradle every individual in whom we find anything to admire <lb/>
            and commend. Poverty, I say, she who in former ages was <lb/>
            the foundress of all cities, the inventress of all arts, she who is <lb/>
            guiltless of all offence, who is lavish of all glory, who has been <lb/>
            honoured with every praise among all nations. For this same <lb/>
            Poverty it was that among the Greeks showed herself just in <lb/>
            Aristides, humane in Phocion, resolute in Epaminondas, wise <lb/>
            in Socrates, and eloquent in Homer. It was this same Poverty, <lb/>
            too, that for the Roman people laid the very earliest founda­ <lb/>
            tions of their sway, and that offers sacrifice to the immortal <lb/>
            Gods in their behalf with the ladle and the dish of clay, even <lb/>
            to this day.</p>
          <p>If there were now sitting as judges at this trial, C. Fabri- <lb/>
            cius, Cneius Scipio, and Manius Curius, whose daughters, by <lb/>
            reason of their poverty, went home to their husbands portioned <lb/>
            at the public expense, carrying with them the glories of their <lb/>
            family and the money of the public, if Publicola, the ex- <lb/>
            peller of the kings, and [Menenius] Agrippa, the reconciler of <lb/>
             <pb n="266"/>
            the people, the expense of whose funerals was, in consequence <lb/>
            of their limited fortunes, defrayed by the Roman people, by <lb/>
            contributions of the smallest coins; * if Attilius Regulus, whose <lb/>
            little field was, in consequence of a like poverty, cultivated at <lb/>
            the public expense; if, in fine, all those ancient families, en­ <lb/>
            nobled by consulships, censorships, and triumphs, could obtain <lb/>
            a short respite, and return to light and take part in this trial, <lb/>
            would you then have dared to reproach a philosopher for his <lb/>
            poverty, in the presence of so many consuls distinguished for <lb/>
            theirs ?</p>
          <p>Or is it that Claudius Maximus appears to you to be a suit­ <lb/>
            able listener, while you are deriding poverty, because he hap­ <lb/>
            pens to be the owner of an ample estate ? You are mistaken, <lb/>
            AEmilianus, and little are you acquainted with his feelings, if <lb/>
            you form your estimate of him according to the indulgence of <lb/>
            Fortune, and not according to the strict rules of philosophy; if <lb/>
            you suppose that a man of such rigid morals and so long used <lb/>
            to warfare, is not better disposed towards circumscribed mode­ <lb/>
            ration than fastidious opulence ; if you suppose that he does <lb/>
            not approve of wealth on the same principles that he does a <lb/>
            garment, rather when it suits the person than when it is re­ <lb/>
            markable for its length. For wealth, too, if it is not conve­ <lb/>
            niently carried, becomes an impediment to us, and trips us up, <lb/>
            no less than a draggling garment. Indeed, in all matters <lb/>
            which are needed for the requirements of life, every thing <lb/>
            that steps beyond becoming moderation is superfluous, and is <lb/>
            rather a burden to us than useful. Hence it is, that immo­ <lb/>
            derate wealth, just like a large and disproportioned rudder, is <lb/>
            more apt to sink than to guide, for in such a case people have <lb/>
            a useless abundance, a pernicious superfluity.</p>
          <p>I see, besides, that among the most opulent persons, those <lb/>
            are especially commended who make no bustle., no immo­ <lb/>
            derate show; who live without thrusting their wealth into' <lb/>
            public view, who manage their vast resources without ostenta­ <lb/>
            tion and without pride, and who imitate the poor in the appear­ <lb/>
            ance of limited means. If, then, the rich. even seek a certain <lb/>
            appearance-a colour of poverty-in order to put on the sem­ <lb/>
            blance of limited means, why should those who are poorer be <lb/>
            ashamed of it, when they have to endure a poverty not affected, <lb/>
            but real ? <note type="footnote"> * Smallest coins.]—‘ Sextantibus.' The ' sextans' was the sixth part of <lb/>
            an ' as.' </note> <pb n="267"/>
            </p>
          <p>I could, indeed, raise an argument with you about the <lb/>
            very name itself, and I could show that none of us are poor <lb/>
            who do not wish for superfluities, and who possess the things <lb/>
            that are necessary, which, by nature, are but few indeed. For <lb/>
            he has the. most who desires the least: he who wants but <lb/>
            little, is most likely to have as much as he wants. For this <lb/>
            reason it is that riches are not better estimated according to <lb/>
            lands and income than according to a man's own mind; for if <lb/>
            a man is craving through avarice, and always greedy of gain, <lb/>
            not even by mountains of gold will he be satisfied, but he will <lb/>
            be always begging for something, that he may increase his <lb/>
            store. And this is the real exposition of poverty. For all <lb/>
            desire of acquiring, arises from the opinion which each man <lb/>
            entertains as to what is poverty. And it matters not how <lb/>
            great is the amount of which you are in want—Philus had not <lb/>
            so great an estate as Lælius, Lælius as Scipio, Scipio as Crassus <lb/>
            the Rich, nor even Crassus the Rich as he wished. So that, <lb/>
            although he surpassed all in wealth, he himself was surpassed by <lb/>
            his own avarice, and seemed to be rich in the eyes of all others <lb/>
            rather than in his own. But, on the other hand, those philoso­ <lb/>
            phers of whom I have made mention, wishing for no more than <lb/>
            they could obtain, and actuated by desires commensurate with <lb/>
            their means, were rightfully and deservedly rich and opulent. <lb/>
            For you become poor through the want of acquisition, and rich <lb/>
            through having no wants to satisfy; inasmuch as a state of po­ <lb/>
            verty is ascertained from the manifestation of desire, opulence <lb/>
            from the fact of being satisfied. Therefore, Æmilianus, if you <lb/>
            wish me to be accounted poor, you must of necessity first show <lb/>
            that I am avaricious. For if, in my mind, there is nothing want­ <lb/>
            ing, I care not what external things may be wanting; for in <lb/>
            the abundance of these consists no praise, in the want of them <lb/>
            no blame.</p>
          <p>Suppose, however, that it is otherwise, and that I really <lb/>
            am poor, because Fortune has denied me riches; suppose that, <lb/>
            as often is the case, either my guardian has made away with <lb/>
            them, an enemy robbed me of them, or my father failed <lb/>
            to leave me any ; is a man, then, to be censured for a thing <lb/>
            which is imputed as a fault to no one of the animals, neither <lb/>
            the eagle, nor the bull, nor the lion ? If a horse has good <lb/>
            qualities, and is an easy trotter, and swift in his gallop, no <lb/>
            one censures him for being in want of fodder; and will you <lb/>

            impute it as a fault to me, not that I have said or done <lb/>
            anything that is bad, but that I live contented with my <lb/>
            .humble means, that I have but few servants, that I eat <lb/>
            sparingly, that I am lightly clad, and that I cater but <lb/>
            meagrely ? And yet, on the other hand, small as you think my <lb/>
            means in all these respects, I both think them abundant, and <lb/>
            more than sufficient, and I desire to restrict myself to still <lb/>
            fewer necessities, being fully assured that I shall be the more <lb/>
            happy, the more circumscribed my wants. For it is wivh the <lb/>
            mind just as with the body; in a healthy state it is lightly <lb/>
            clad, but in sickness it is wrapped in cumbrous clothing <lb/>
            and it is a sure sign of infirmity to have many wants. It is <lb/>
            with life just as with swimming; that man is the most ex­ <lb/>
            pert who is the most disengaged from all encumbrances. Just <lb/>
            the same way, amid the stormy tempests of human life, that <lb/>
            which is light tends to our buoyancy, that which is heavy, to <lb/>
            sink us.</p>
          <p>For my part, I have learned that in this especially the Gods <lb/>
            surpass mankind, that they have to satisfy no necessities. Hence <lb/>
            it is, that him among us who has the fewest possible necessities, <lb/>
            I consider most strongly to resemble a God. I was very well <lb/>
            pleased, therefore, when you said, intending it as a reproach, <lb/>
            that my property consisted of a staff and a wallet. And I only <lb/>
            wish that I had such perfect control over my mind, that I <lb/>
            required nothing whatever beyond those articles, and be­ <lb/>
            comingly submitted to the same equipment which Crates, <lb/>
            throwing all riches aside, spontaneously desired. This Crates, <lb/>
            if you will take my word for it, JEmilianus, was a man of the <lb/>
            higher class of Thebes, rich, and ennobled in his city through <lb/>
            his love of that very state which you impute to me as a fault. <lb/>
            He presented his large and ample property to the people, and <lb/>
            putting away his numerous retinue of servants, made choice of <lb/>
            a life of solitude; his trees, numerous and fruitful as they <lb/>
            were, he scorned in comparison with a single staff; his most <lb/>
            elegant villas he changed for a single scrip; the praises of <lb/>
            which he afterwards even sang in verse, on experience of <lb/>
            its utility, adapting to the purpose those lines of Homer in <lb/>
            which he celebrates the Isle of Crete. I will mention the <lb/>
            words with which he commences, that you may not suppose I <lb/>
            have only invented this for the purpose of my defence—<lb/>
             <pb n="269"/>
            " Scrip is a city's name,* which 'mid dense smoke <lb/>
            Lies fair and flourishing." <lb/>
            And then follow lines so admirable, that, if you were to read <lb/>
            them, you would be much more inclined to envy me my wallet <lb/>
            than the hand of Pudentilla. Do you censure philosophers <lb/>
            for their scrip and staff ? By the same reasoning, you ought to <lb/>
            censure horsemen for their trappings, foot-soldiers for their <lb/>
            bucklers, standard-bearers for their ensigns, and those, in fine, <lb/>
            who enjoy a triumph for their white steeds, and their robes <lb/>
            embroidered with sprigs of palm.</p>
          <p>These, however, are not the equipments of the Platonic sect, <lb/>
            but they are the insignia of the class of Cynics. Still, the <lb/>
            scrip and the staff were the same to Diogenes and to An- <lb/>
            tisthenes, as the diadem to kings, the martial cloak to generals, <lb/>
            the rounded hat to priests, and the crooked staff to augurs. <lb/>
            Indeed, Diogenes the Cynic, when disputing with Alexander <lb/>
            the Great as to who was the true king, boasted of his staff as <lb/>
            serving him in the stead of a sceptre. Even the invincible <lb/>
            Hercules himself—(you will, no doubt, feel a perfect contempt <lb/>
            for those others, as a set of mendicants) — Hercules him. <lb/>
            self, I say, the traveller over the whole earth, the cleanser <lb/>
            thereof from wild beasts, the subduer of nations, when he was <lb/>
            travelling through the earth, and shortly before he was sum­ <lb/>
            moned to heaven for his virtues, had no better clothing than a <lb/>
            single hide, although he was a God,' and no other attendants <lb/>
            than a single staff.</p>
          <p>If, however, you think nothing at all of these instances, and <lb/>
            have summoned me not to plead a cause, but to discourse upon <lb/>
            my income, that you may not be in ignorance about any of <lb/>
            my affairs, if, indeed, you are ignorant, I admit that my father <lb/>
            left me and my brother a little under twenty hundred thou­ <lb/>
            sand sesterces, and that that sum has been a little diminished <lb/>
            by me, in consequence of prolonged travel, close study, and fre­ <lb/>
            quent donations. For I have given assistance to most of my <lb/>
            friends, paid their fees to numbers of instructors, and have <lb/>
            given dowries even to the daughters of some : nor indeed, for <lb/>
            my own part, should I have hesitated to spend even the whole <lb/>
            of my patrimony, in order to acquire, what to me is of far . <lb/>
            greater value, a. contempt for all wealth. <note type="footnote"> * Scrip is a city's name.]—He puts IT <foreign xml:lang="grc">Πήρη</foreign>, a ' scrip,’ or 'wallet,' in <lb/>

            </p>
          <p>You, on the other hand, JEmilianus, and men like you, un­ <lb/>
            polished and uncouth, are to be valued, no doubt, just according <lb/>
            to what you possess ; just as a barren and unproductive tree, <lb/>
            which bears no fruit, is to be estimated in value according to <lb/>
            the amount of timber to be found in its trunk. Nevertheless, <lb/>
            forbear, Æmilianus, from this time forward, to throw his <lb/>
            poverty in the teeth of any man, seeing that, up to a very re­ <lb/>
            cent date, you used to plough for three days single-handed <lb/>
            the one little field at Zaratha, which your father left you, with <lb/>
            the assistance of a solitary ass to get it ready before the usual <lb/>
            wet season. Nor is it such a very long time since the nume­ <lb/>
            rous deaths of relatives came to your support, by giving you <lb/>
            the possession of property that you little deserved ; a circum­ <lb/>
            stance from which, still more than from that most ugly face of <lb/>
            yours, you have obtained the name of Charon.</p>
          <p>And now as to my native country, and your shewing that <lb/>
            it is situate on the confines of Numidia and of Getulia, from <lb/>
            writings of mine, in which I confessed, when I was lecturing <lb/>
            before that most illustrious man, Lollianus Avitus, that I was <lb/>
            a Semi-Numidian and a Semi-Getulian; I do not see what I <lb/>
            have to be ashamed of in that respect, any more than the <lb/>
            elder Cyrus, because he was of mingled parentage, being a <lb/>
            Semi-Median and a Semi-Persian. For the proper subject of <lb/>
            enquiry is not where. a man is born, but what are his man­ <lb/>
            ners ; not in what country, but upon what principle he began <lb/>
            life is the thing to be considered. It is with good reason <lb/>
            allowed the gardener and the vintner to recommend vege­ <lb/>
            tables and wine according to the nobleness of the soil; the wine <lb/>
            of Thasos,* for instance, and the vegetables of Phlius. For it <lb/>
            is a fact, that those productions of the earth are much im­ <lb/>
            proved in flavour by the natural fertility of the district, the <lb/>
            rain of the heavens, the mildness of the breezes, the brightness <lb/>
            of the sun, and the richness of the soil.</p>
          <p>But, on the other hand, while the mind of man is sojourning <lb/>
            in the abode of the body which is foreign to it, how can any <lb/>
            of these particulars in any way add to or subtract from its <lb/>
            merits or its demerits ? When was it not the case that in every <note type="footnote"> * Of Thasos.]—Thasos, an island in the Ægean sea, was famous for <lb/>
            the excellence of its wines. The vicinity of the city of Phlino, near Ar. <lb/>
            Los, was equally famous for its growth of vegetables. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="271"/>
            nation various dispositions were to be found ? and this, al­ <lb/>
            though some of them seem to be peculiarly distinguished for <lb/>
            stupidity, others for talent. Among the Scythians, a people <lb/>
            most remarkable for their stupidity, was born the wise Ana­ <lb/>
            charsis; among the clever Athenians, the fool Melitides. Nor <lb/>
            do -I say this because I am in any way ashamed of my <lb/>
            country, even though ours had still been the city of Syphax ;* <lb/>
            we, however, were conquered, on which we were presented as <lb/>
            a gift of the Roman people to king Masinissa, and after that, <lb/>
            on a new allotment of land being made among the veteran sol­ <lb/>
            diers, we rose to be what we now are, a most famous colony. <lb/>
            In this colony it was, that my father, a man of the highest <lb/>
            rank, a duumvir, enjoyed every honour; whose position I <lb/>
            have occupied in the same community, from the time I was <lb/>
            admitted to the rank of decurion, having in no way dege­ <lb/>
            nerated from him, and, I both hope and think, enjoying the <lb/>
            same amount of honor and of estimation.</p>
          <p>Why do I mention these particulars ? In order that you, <lb/>
            Æmilianus, may have the fewer pretences for levelling your <lb/>
            invectives against me in future; and that you may be the <lb/>
            more inclined to pardon me, if, in my negligence, I did omit <lb/>
            to make choice of that Attic Zarath † of yours, to be born <lb/>
            in. Are you not ashamed of yourselves, thus perseveringly, <lb/>
            in the presence of such a man, to prefer such accusations as <lb/>
            these ? To bring forward matters so frivolous, and at the <lb/>
            same time of so conflicting a nature, and yet to charge me as <lb/>
            being guilty of them all ? Have you not accused me on con­ <lb/>
            tradictory grounds ? on those of the wallet and the staff, be­ <lb/>
            cause of my rigidness of life; on those of the verses and the <lb/>
            looking-glass, on account of my frivolity; of having but one <lb/>
            servant, as being penurious; of having three freedmen, as being <lb/>
            a spendthrift; and then, besides, of being in eloquence a <lb/>
            Greek, by birth a barbarian. Why do you not rouse up your <lb/>
            senses, and recollect that you are pleading your cause before <lb/>
            Claudius Maximus, before a man of serious habits, and one <lb/>
            engaged with the affairs of this entire province ? Why not <note type="footnote"> * City of Syphax.]—Who, contrary to his promise, sided with Han­ <lb/>

            away with these vain reproaches ? Why not prove, whit you <lb/>
            have accused me of, heinous crimes, lawless misdeeds, and <lb/>
            wicked artifices ? Why is your speech thus weak in argu <lb/>
            ments, thus mighty in outcry ?</p>
          <p>I now come to the charge itself of magic, that blazing brand <lb/>
            which you lighted up against me with such immense clamour, <lb/>
            but which has disappointed the expectation of all, dying <lb/>
            out into I know not what old woman's stories. Have you <lb/>
            not, Maximus, sometimes beheld a fire that has broken out <lb/>
            amid stubble? how loud its crackling, how large its blaze, how <lb/>
            rapid its growth, and yet, after all, how slight the fuel on <lb/>
            which it feeds, how short-lived the flame, that leaves after it <lb/>
            no remains! In that flame behold this accusation, which <lb/>
            began in abuse, which has been fanned by assertions, which <lb/>
            has failed in its proofs, and which, after your sentence shall <lb/>
            have been pronounced, is destined to survive in not a single <lb/>
            remnant of this false charge: a charge which has been en­ <lb/>
            tirely centred by Æmilianus in the proof of this one point, <lb/>
            that I am a magician; for which reason I may be allowed <lb/>
            to enquire of these most learned advocates of his, what a <lb/>
            magician is.</p>
          <p>For if, as I have read in many authors, a magician* means, <lb/>
            in the language of the Persians, the same thing that the word <lb/>
            “ priest" does in ours, what is the crime, pray, in being a ma­ <lb/>
            gician ? what is the crime in properly knowing, and under­ <lb/>
            standing, and being versed in the laws of ceremonials, the <lb/>
            solemn order of sacred rites, and religious ordinances ? What <lb/>
            if, indeed, that is magic, which Plato calls " the service of the <lb/>
            Gods," when he relates with what careful training the Per­ <lb/>
            sians bring up a youth who is destined for the throne. I recollect <lb/>
            the very words of that divine man, and do you, Maximus, <lb/>
            recall them to your memory with me: " When he is fourteen <lb/>
            years of age, those persons take charge of the boy, whom they <lb/>
            call 'the royal tutors.' These are four persons, whom they <lb/>
            select from the highest classes of the Persians, and who are ap <lb/>
            proved of for their age. One of these is the most wise, ano­ <lb/>
            ther the most just, another the most prudent, and the fourth <lb/>
            the most valiant man. Of these, one instructs him in the <lb/>
            magic of Zoroaster and of Oromazes, which is the service of <lb/>
            the Gods. He also teaches him the art of governing." <note type="footnote"> * A mayician.]—Magus. </note> <pb n="273"/>
            </p>
          <p>Do yoa not hear then, you who are so rash as to accuse me <lb/>
            of it, that magic is an art acceptable to the Gods, one that <lb/>
            most correctly teaches us how to worship and to venerate them; <lb/>
            one that is consequently consistent with piety, and skilled in <lb/>
            all divine matters; one that has been ennobled from the very <lb/>
            times of Zoroaster and of Oromazes, its inventors, as being the <lb/>
            handmaid of the inhabitants of heaven ? For among the very <lb/>
            rudiments of the royal training this art is taught; nor is any <lb/>
            one of the Persians rashly allowed to be a magician, any more <lb/>
            than he is to be a king.</p>
          <p>The same Plato, in another discourse of his, when speaking <lb/>
            of a certain Zamolxis, a Thracian by birth, but a man skilled <lb/>
            in the same art, has left a passage in his writings to the fol­ <lb/>
            lowing effect:—“ But he said, 0 happy man, that the soul is <lb/>
            healed by certain incantations; and that these incantations <lb/>
            are soothing words." And if this is the fact, what reason is <lb/>
            there why I should not be allowed to understand either the <lb/>
            soothing words of Zamolxis, or the priestly duties enjoined by <lb/>
            Zoroaster ? But if, after the common usage, these people ima­ <lb/>
            gine that a magician is properly a person who, from commu­ <lb/>
            nication and discourse with the immortal Gods, is able, by a <lb/>
            certain incredible power centred in his incantations, to do <lb/>
            everything he pleases, then I greatly wonder, why they have <lb/>
            not been afraid to accuse me, when they admit that I am <lb/>
            possessed of such mighty powers. For you cannot take pre­ <lb/>
            cautions against a power that is of a nature so mysterious <lb/>
            and so divine, in the same way that other influences may be <lb/>
            guarded against. He who summons an assassin before the <lb/>
            judge, comes there attended by others; he who accuses a poi­ <lb/>
            soner, uses every precaution in taking his food; he who charges <lb/>
            a man with theft, keeps watch over his property.</p>
          <p>But here, on the other hand, he who puts a magician, such <lb/>
            as they speak of, on trial for his life, by means of what attend­ <lb/>
            ants, what precautions, what guards, is he to ward off a de­ <lb/>
            struction that is as unforeseen as it is inevitable ? Most as­ <lb/>
            suredly, by none : hence a charge of this kind is not likely to <lb/>
            be preferred by one who believes in its truth. But these accu­ <lb/>
            sations, by a kind of error universally prevalent among the <lb/>
            ignorant, are generally made against philosophers; thus, for <lb/>
            instance, such of them as make enquiry into the pure and pri­ <lb/>
            mary causes of matter, they look upon as irreligious, and, on <note type="footnote"> T </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="274"/>
            that account, assert that they deny the existence of Gods; <lb/>
            such as Anaxagoras, Leucippua, Democritus, Epicurus, and <lb/>
            other advocates of natural causes; others, again, who, with more <lb/>
            than ordinary curiosity, enquire into the governance of the <lb/>
            world, and with the greatest earnestness venerate the Gods, <lb/>
            to these, too, do the vulgar give the name of magicians; sup­ <lb/>
            posing that they know how to bring about those operations <lb/>
            which they know to take place: such, for instance, were in <lb/>
            former days, Epimenides, Orpheus, Pythagoras, and Ostanes.* <lb/>
            In like manner, the Purifications of Empedocles, the Daemon <lb/>
            of Socrates, and the abstract " Good" of Plato, became similar <lb/>
            objects of suspicion. Consequently, I congratulate myself, <lb/>
            when I find myself added to this long list of great men.</p>
          <p>Still, I am afraid that the frivolous, silly, and trifling things <lb/>
            that they have alleged against me in support of their charge, <lb/>
            you will consider to make against me, if only on the ground <lb/>
            that they have been so alleged. “ Why," said he, “ have <lb/>
            you been enquiring after certain kinds of fishes ?" Just as <lb/>
            though a philosopher were not at liberty to do that, in the <lb/>
            cause of knowledge, which an epicure may do to satisfy his <lb/>
            gluttony. "Why has a free-born woman married you after <lb/>
            she has passed fourteen years in a state of widowhood ?" Just <lb/>
            as though it were not a greater cause for wonderment that she <lb/>
            remained unmarried so many years. " Why, before she was <lb/>
            married to you, did she write I know not what thoughts of <lb/>
            hers in a certain letter ?" Just as though any one were bound <lb/>
            to tell another the reasons for his thoughts. " Then, besides, <lb/>
            she, a person advanced in years, did not hesitate to marry a <lb/>
            young man." Why, that very fact, affords a proof that there <lb/>
            was no need of magic to prompt a woman to marry a man, a <lb/>
            widow a bachelor, one advanced in years, her junior; and then <lb/>
            come these other points of a similar nature—“ Apuleius has <lb/>
            got something at home which he worships in secret." Just as <lb/>
            though it would not rather be a ground for crimination not to <lb/>
            have some object to worship. " A boy fell down in the pre­ <lb/>
            sence of Apuleius." And what if a young, man, what if an <lb/>
            old man even had fallen to the ground while I was standing <lb/>
            by, whether he happened to be attacked by some bodily malady, <note type="footnote"> * Ostanes.]—There were two Persian philosophers of this name. One <lb/>
            accompanied the expedition of Xerxes against Greece; the other was <lb/>

             <pb n="275"/>
            or lost his balance through the slippery natuie of the ground ? <lb/>
            Is it on these proofs you would convict me of magical prac­ <lb/>
            tices—the tumbling down of a boy, the marriage of a woman, <lb/>
            and the purchase of some fish ?</p>
          <p>For my own part, I certainly could, with entire safety to <lb/>
            myself, be content, after saying even thus much, to come to a <lb/>
            conclusion. Still as, in proportion to the lengthiness of the <lb/>
            speech made for the prosecution, the water [in the clepsydra] <lb/>
            shows that there is abundance of time left, let us, if you <lb/>
            think proper, consider things in detail. And, for my part, all <lb/>
            the charges that have been brought against me, whether they <lb/>
            are true or false, I shall not deny, but will admit them, just as <lb/>
            though they really were the fact; so that all this vast multi­ <lb/>
            tude, which has flocked together from every quarter to hear <lb/>
            this trial, may fully understand, that not only nothing can be <lb/>
            truthfully alleged against philosophers, but that nothing even <lb/>
            can be falsely devised against them, which they would not <lb/>
            prefer to rebut, although they could deny it, in full reliance <lb/>
            on their innocence. First, then, I will meet their arguments, <lb/>
            and will prove that they bear no relation whatever to the <lb/>
            practice of magic; and, after that,. I will show that, even if I <lb/>
            had been a magician of first-rate ability, still, no cause or <lb/>
            opportunity has existed for them to detect me in any mal­ <lb/>
            practice whatever. I will at the same time discuss more fully <lb/>
            their unfounded envy, their shameful conduct in reading the <lb/>
            letters of this lady, and their still more disgraceful interpreta­ <lb/>
            tion put upon those letters, with. all the circumstances of the <lb/>
            marriage between. myself and Pudentilla: and I will show that <lb/>
            I entered into that alliance more from a sense of duty than for <lb/>
            gain. And, really, what a mighty cause of torment and uneasi­ <lb/>
            ness has this marriage of ours. proved to Æmilianus! Hence all <lb/>
            that anger, and rage, and absolute frenzy,, which have found <lb/>
            a vent in the present prosecution. And if I shall succeed in <lb/>
            proving all these points clearly and distinctly, then I shall call <lb/>
            upon you, Claudius Maximus, and all you who are here present, <lb/>
            to bear witnessthat this youth, Sicinius Pudens, my son-in-law, <lb/>
            in whose name and by whose wish I am accused by his uncle, <lb/>
            has but just-now been removed from my charge, since his bro­ <lb/>
            ther Pontianus, his senior in years, and his superior in character, <lb/>
            departed this life; and I will show that he has been thus nefa­ <lb/>
            riously worked upon against myself and his mother, through <note type="footnote"> x 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="276"/>
            no fault of mine; and that, having forsaken the pursuits of <lb/>
            literature, and abandoned all studies, he is likely, if we may <lb/>
            form a judgment from the wicked plans betrayed in this accu­ <lb/>
            sation, to turn out much more like his uncle Æmilianus than <lb/>
            his brother Pontianus.</p>
          <p>I will now proceed, as I originally purposed, to all the frantic <lb/>
            conceptions of Æmilianus here, and I will begin with that <lb/>
            one which you heard him state at the outset as affording the <lb/>
            strongest grounds for suspecting me of the practice of magic- <lb/>
            the fact, I mean, that I have purchased various kinds of fish of <lb/>
            some fishermen. Which, now, of these circumstances is it <lb/>
            that is to lead to a suspicion of magic ? Is it the fact that <lb/>
            fishermen have endeavoured to procure these fish for me ? I <lb/>
            suppose, then, this task ought to have been entrusted to some <lb/>
            dyers or carpenters; and that, on the same principle, the pur­ <lb/>
            suit of every art ought to have changed hands, so that the <lb/>
            carpenter should have netted fish for me, and the fisherman <lb/>
            have planed wood. Or, is it that you feel satisfied that fishes <lb/>
            must be sought for unlawful practices, because they are sought <lb/>
            on the terms of purchase ? If I had wanted them to set on <lb/>
            table, I should have tried to get them for nothing, no doubt. <lb/>
            Why, then, do you not accuse me in like manner on many other <lb/>
            points ? For many a time have I, for money, purchased wine, <lb/>
            vegetables, fruit, and bread. Why, if you carry out this prin­ <lb/>
            ciple, you prescribe starvation to all purveyors of dainties. For <lb/>
            who will dare to make purchase of them, if it is looked upon <lb/>
            as a matter of course, that all eatables that are procured with <lb/>
            money are wanted, not for food, but for the purposes of magic ?</p>
          <p>But if there is no suspicion whatever existing, either in con­ <lb/>
            sequence of the fact of fishermen being induced, for a sum of <lb/>
            money, to do that which they are in the general habit of do- <lb/>
            in-, namely, catching fish—(they have taken care, however, <lb/>
            to summon none of these fishermen as witnesses, for the best <lb/>
            of reasons, because none such there were )-nor yet of the fact <lb/>
            of a price being given for a marketable commodity—(the <lb/>
            amount of which price, however, they have taken care not to <lb/>
            state, for fear lest, if they had named a moderate price, their <lb/>
            story might have met with contempt, and, if an exorbitant <lb/>
            one, it might not have been believed) ; if, on these points, I <lb/>
            say, no ground for suspicion exists, then let JEmilianus answer <lb/>
            me, on what evident grounds was he induced to make this <lb/>
             <pb n="277"/>
            charge of magical practices ? " You endeavoured to procure <lb/>
            some fish," says he. I do not wish to deny the fact. But tell <lb/>
            me, I beg of you, is he who endeavours to procure some fish <lb/>
            a magician ? For my own part, I don't think he is a bit the <lb/>
            more so than if he were in search of hares, or boars, or fowl. <lb/>
            Or is it that fishes alone are in possession of certain pro­ <lb/>
            perties that are hidden from other people, but known to ma­ <lb/>
            gicians ? If you know what this property is, then it is clear <lb/>
            that you yourself are a magician; but if you do not know it, <lb/>
            then you must, of necessity, confess that you are accusing a <lb/>
            person of a thing about which you know nothing whatever.</p>
          <p>Are you, then, so unversed in all literature, Day, in all the <lb/>
            stories of the vulgar, that you cannot so much as coin these <lb/>
            fictions of yours with some air of probability ? For how <lb/>
            should a lumpish and chilly fish, or anything that is found in <lb/>
            the sea, be able to kindle the flames of desire ? But perhaps <lb/>
            you were induced to frame this falsehood from the circum­ <lb/>
            stance that Venus is said to have arisen from the sea. Take <lb/>
            note, if you please, Tannonius Pudens, of how much you were <lb/>
            ignorant, when you undertook to prove the practice of magic <lb/>
            from the procuring of fish. Had you been a reader of Virgil, <lb/>
            you certainly would have known that other things are usually <lb/>
            sought for such purposes. For, so far as I recollect, that poet <lb/>
            enumerates fillets of soft wool, unctuous vervain, male frank­ <lb/>
            incense, and threads of various colours; besides crackling <lb/>
            laurel, clay that hardens, and wax that liquefies, as well as <lb/>
            some other things, which he has described in his more serious <lb/>
            work.* <lb/>
            “ She sprinkles round, <lb/>
            With feign'd Avernian drops, the hallow'd ground, <lb/>
            Culls hoary simples, found by Phœbe's light, <lb/>
            With brazen sickles reap'd at noon of night; <lb/>

            of scales and bones; he culls from the meadow, you ransack <lb/>
            the deep. I could also have quoted to you similar passages <lb/>
            from Theocritus, others, again, from Homer, and a great num­ <lb/>
            ber from Orpheus, and I could have repeated a multitude of <lb/>
            lines from the Greek comedies and tragedies, as well as from <lb/>
            the historians, had I not already observed that you were un­ <lb/>
            able to read the letter of Pudentilla, because it was written <lb/>
            in Greek. I will therefore just dip into one more Latin poet: <lb/>
            here are the lines, which those will easily recognise who have <lb/>
            read Laevius: * <lb/>
            " Look for your antidote it on every side <lb/>
            They snatch up charms of all sorts, whirling rhombs, <lb/>
            Of magic potency; wing tails, and threads <lb/>
            Of varied colours, and entwined ; with roots <lb/>
            And herbs and suckers; from the neighing colt <lb/>
            Torn is the stimulant ‡ of fierce desire." <lb/>
            If you had had any acquaintance with literature, you would <lb/>
            have framed your fictions with much more probability, if you <lb/>
            had stated that I had sought for these and other things; for <lb/>
            perhaps, in consequence of the stories so universally spread <lb/>
            about them, some credit would have then attached to your <lb/>
            mention of these particulars. But when a fish is caught, what <lb/>
            is it good for except to be cooked and served up at table ? but <lb/>
            for magic it is of no avail.</p>
          <p>I will state to you my reasons for thinking so. Many have <lb/>
            supposed that Pythagoras was a follower of Zoroaster, and was, <lb/>
            like him, skilled in magic, and have informed us in their <lb/>
            writings, that when in the vicinity of Metapontum, on the <lb/>
            shores of his own part of Italy which he had made a kind of <lb/>
            second Greece, § he saw a seine drawn up by certain fisher- <note type="footnote"> * Lævius.]—It is a matter of doubt whether the reading here is <lb/>

            which was valued as being proof against the operations of witchcraft. </note><note type="footnote"> ‡ The stimulant.]—The hippomanes. </note><note type="footnote"> § Second Greece.]—He alludes to the south of Italy, which was called </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="279"/>
            men, whereupon he purchased the chances of the haul; and <lb/>
            that after he had paid the money, he immediately gave orders <lb/>
            that the fish which had been caught should be released from <lb/>
            the nets, and returned to the deep. Now, I suppose, he <lb/>
            would not have let them go out of his hands, if he had found <lb/>
            in them anything useful for magical purposes. For this man, <lb/>
            so well versed in all learning, and so close an imitator of the <lb/>
            ancients, remembered full well that Homer, a poet gifted with <lb/>
            universal knowledge, had, in his writings, attributed all the <lb/>
            power of drugs to the earth, and not to the sea; for when <lb/>
            speaking of a certain enchantress, he writes thus: <lb/>
            " These drugs, so friendly to the joys of life, <lb/>
            Bright Helen learned from Thone's imperial wife, <lb/>
            Who swayed the sceptre, where prolific Nile <lb/>
            With various simples clothes the fatten'd soil; <lb/>
            With wholesome herbage mix'd, the direful bane <lb/>
            Of vegetable venom taints the plain."* <lb/>
            And so likewise in another passage: <lb/>
            " Thus while he spoke, the sovereign plant he drew, <lb/>
            Where on th' all-bearing earth unmark'd it grew."t <lb/>
            While, on the other hand, you will never find in his writings <lb/>
            either that Proteus drugged his changing figure with any <lb/>
            marine and fishy substance, or Ulysses the trench, J Bolus the <lb/>
            bag, Helen the goblet, Circe the cup, or Venus her girdle. <lb/>
            Why, you are the only people to be found in the memory of <lb/>
            man who, forming, as it were, a kind of hodge-podge of the <lb/>
            productions of nature, make nothing of transferring the virtues <lb/>
            of herbs, and roots, and suckers, and pebbles from the tops <lb/>
            of mountains to the depths of the sea, and there sewing them <lb/>
            up in the bellies of fishes. Hence, just as Mercury, the con­ <lb/>

            wine and drugs, to banish grief and tears, Book IV. ; the cup in which Circe <lb/>
            mingled the drugs, by means of which she changed the companions of <lb/>
            Ulysses into swine, Book X.; and the girdle of Venus, the wondrous vir­ <lb/>

             <pb n="280"/>
            the looker-on in the night, and Trivia, the mistress of the <lb/>
            shades, used to be summoned to the ceremonies of the magi­ <lb/>
            cians ; so, according to your account, henceforth Neptune, in <lb/>
            company with Salacia, and Portumnus, and the whole throng <lb/>
            of the Nereids, will have been transferred from the surging agi­ <lb/>
            tations of the waves to the agitations of passionate desire.</p>
          <p>I have now stated why, in my opinion, there is nothing in <lb/>
            common between magicians and fishes. But now, if you think <lb/>
            proper, let us believe, Æmilianus, that fishes really are in the <lb/>
            habit of promoting magical influences. Does it, then, follow, <lb/>
            as a necessary consequence, that whoever seeks for a fish is a <lb/>
            magician ? By the same rule, the person who tries to procure <lb/>
            a light cutter is a pirate, he who looks for a crow-bar is a <lb/>
            housebreaker, and he who seeks a sword is a cut-throat. <lb/>
            Nothing of ever so harmless a nature can you mention, but <lb/>
            may possibly be used to man's disadvantage; and nothing, of <lb/>
            ever so pleasing a tendency, but may be taken in bad part. <lb/>
            Yet it is not, for all that, a necessary consequence that all <lb/>
            things should obtain an utterly bad reputation; as, for instance, <lb/>
            that you should suppose that frankincense, and cassia, and <lb/>
            myrrh, and such other aromatics, are only bought for the pur­ <lb/>
            pose of being used at funerals, seeing that they are also used <lb/>
            in medical preparations, and in sacrifices.</p>
          <p>But, according to this mode of reasoning about fish, you <lb/>
            would suppose that the companions of Menelaiis, too, were <lb/>
            magicians, inasmuch as the greatest of poets says that at the <lb/>
            island of Pharos they banished hunger by using curved hooks. <lb/>
            In the same class, too, you will have to place sea-gulls, dol­ <lb/>
            phins, and cray-fish; and then all epicures, too, who pur­ <lb/>
            chase largely of fishermen; and even the fishermen them­ <lb/>
            selves, who, in pursuit of their calling, seek for all kinds of <lb/>
            fish. " Why, then," say you, " do you try to procure them ?" <lb/>
            Really I do not choose, nor do I deem it necessary, to tell <lb/>
            you ; but show me, I beg of you, if you possibly can, that I <lb/>
            have tried to procure fish for those purposes you state. Sup­ <lb/>
            pose I had bought hellebore, hemlock, or the juice of poppies, <lb/>
            and other things, the use of which, in moderation, is conducive <lb/>
            to health, but which, when mixed or taken in large quan­ <lb/>
            tities, are dangerous; who could with common patience have <lb/>
            endured it, if you had accused me of poisoning, because by <lb/>
            means of these things a man may lose his life ?</p><pb n="281"/>
            
          <p>Let us see, however, what were the different kinds of fishes <lb/>
            which were so necessary for me to possess, and so rarely to be <lb/>
            met with, as to deserve to be sought for on the promise of a <lb/>
            reward. Three only have they named; in one they were <lb/>
            mistaken, while the other two they invented. They were <lb/>
            mistaken in saying thaf the fish was a sea-hare, for it was quite <lb/>
            a different kind of fish altogether; one which my servant <lb/>
            Themiso, a person by no means ignorant of the medical art, <lb/>
            as you have heard from his own lips, brought to me quite <lb/>
            unasked, for me to look at; for the fact is, that he has not <lb/>
            even yet managed to find a sea-hare. Still, I am ready to <lb/>
            admit that I have been in search of other kinds besides, and <lb/>
            that I have given a commission not only to fishermen, but to <lb/>
            my friends also, wherever a person meets with a fish of any <lb/>
            unusual kind, either to describe to me the form of it, or else <lb/>
            to show it me alive, or, if he cannot do so, dead. Why I have <lb/>
            done this, I will presently proceed to inform you.</p>
          <p>But these accusers of mine, so extremely clever, as they <lb/>
            fancy themselves to be, were guilty of a falsehood, when, to­ <lb/>
            wards the end of their charge, they invented the story that I <lb/>
            had been in search of two marine productions with indelicate <lb/>
            names. Those productions, Tannonius here, though he wished <lb/>
            the genitals of both sexes to be understood, could not, all- <lb/>
            accomplished pleader as he is, think of mentioning for very <lb/>
            bash fulness; and, at last, after much stammering and bun­ <lb/>
            gling, he called the fish he meant, by a vile paraphrasis, "the <lb/>
            marine virile member." * But as for the fish called "feminal," † <lb/>
            finding himself unable, in any way whatever, to mention it <lb/>
            with common decency, he betook himself to my writings, and, <lb/>
            because he had read a passage from a book of mine, to this <lb/>
            effect-" May cover the ' interfeminium' both by crossing the <lb/>
            thighs and shading it with the hand," in due conformity ‡ <lb/>
            with the gravity of his own character, he imputed it as a fault <lb/>
            to me, that I was not ashamed to speak decently of shameful <lb/>
            things.</p>
          <p>Why, on the contrary, I might, with much more justice, <note type="footnote"> * The marine virile member.]- The fish was the Veretilla, a name syno­ <lb/>
            nymous witi the male organs of generation. </note><note type="footnote"> t Feminal.]—A Latin name for the female organs ; the name also of a <lb/>

             <pb n="282"/>
            have censured him, who, whilst he publicly professes the art <lb/>
            of eloquence, babbles shamefully even about things that are <lb/>
            proper to be mentioned, and often, when speaking about sub­ <lb/>
            jects that present not the slightest difficulty, either hems and <lb/>
            haws, or comes to a dead stop altogether. Now, tell me, if I <lb/>
            had said nothing at all about that statue of Venus,* and had <lb/>
            never mentioned the word " interfeminium," pray, in what <lb/>
            words would you have accused me on this matter, so suited <lb/>
            alike to your stupidity and to your tongue ? Can there be <lb/>
            anything more silly, than from a similarity of names to infer <lb/>
            a similarity of meaning in things ? And yet, perhaps, you <lb/>
            thought that you had shown great acuteness in this dis­ <lb/>
            covery of yours. Why, then, you should have invented in <lb/>
            your charge that I had been in search of these two marine <lb/>
            productions, the " veretilla" and the " virginal," † for ma­ <lb/>
            gical purposes ; for I must teach you the Latin names of things, <lb/>
            and I therefore give you their various appellations, that you <lb/>
            may be instructed another time in what language to make your <lb/>
            charges against me. Bear this in mind, however, that it would <lb/>
            be as ridiculous an argument to hold, that marine productions <lb/>
            with obscene names are required for venereal purposes, as it <lb/>
            would be to say that sea-combs or scallops are sought for the <lb/>
            purpose of combing the hair, or that the hawk-fish is taken <lb/>
            for the purpose of catching birds that fly, the boar-fish for <lb/>
            hunting boars, or sea-skulls with the object of raising the dead. <lb/>
            I make answer, then, to this position of yours, devised, as it is, <lb/>
            no less foolishly than absurdly, that I neither obtained these <lb/>
            marine trifles and gimcracks at any cost whatever, nor yet <lb/>
            gratuitously.</p>
          <p>And this answer I give you furthermore, that you did not <lb/>
            know what it was you were pretending I had been in search <lb/>
            of. For these trifles which you have mentioned, are generally <lb/>
            found lying in abundance on the sea-shores of all countries, <lb/>
            and, without labour on the part of any one, are spontaneously <lb/>
            thrown up by the tide, however gentle the ripple of the waves. <lb/>
            Why, then, do you not assert that, just in the same way, pay­ <lb/>
            ing a heavy price for them, I have employed numbers of <note type="footnote"> * Statue of Venus.]-In describing which, he made use of the word <lb/>

            fishermen to collect on the sea-shore streaked mussels, lumpish <lb/>
            shells, and smooth pebbles ? Why not add the claws of crabs, <lb/>
            the shells of sea-urchins, the feelers of cuttle-fish, and bits of <lb/>
            chips, old stumps, scraps of rope, and worm-pierced oyster. <lb/>
            shells ?* Why not, in fine, moss and sea-weed, and other <lb/>
            things which are thrown up by the sea, which are drifted by <lb/>
            the winds in all quarters upon the shore, cast up on the surface <lb/>
            with the scum, tossed in the tempests to and fro, and stranded <lb/>
            in the calm ?</p>
          <p>And not a jot the less, in the case of the matters which I have <lb/>
            mentioned, may similar suspicions be broached, in accord­ <lb/>
            ance with their respective names. You affirm that things <lb/>
            gathered from the sea, and that bear the names of the male <lb/>
            and female organs, are efficacious in venereal matters, be­ <lb/>
            cause of the similitude of the names; how, then, can it <lb/>
            possibly be other than the fact, that the calculus or smooth <lb/>
            pebble that is picked up from the same sea-shore bears some <lb/>
            reference to the bladder, the shell known to us as " testa"f to <lb/>
            a testamentary devise, the cancer to a cancerous ulcer, the <lb/>
            " alga," or sea-weed, to ague?‡</p>
          <p>Assuredly, Claudius Maximus, you are a most forbearing <lb/>
            man, and one endowed with the greatest humanity, for having, <lb/>
            by Hercules! so long tolerated these arguments of theirs. For <lb/>
            my own part, when these things were stated by them as being <lb/>
            matters serious and unanswerable, I laughed at their folly, and <lb/>
            was surprised at your powers of endurance. But as Æmilianus <lb/>
            is so very anxious about my affairs, he must be made ac­ <lb/>
            quainted why it is that I have examined so many fishes of <lb/>
            late, and why I did not wish to remain unacquainted with any <lb/>
            of them. Although he is well-stricken in years, and in the <lb/>
            decline of life, still, if he chooses, let him receive some in­ <lb/>
            struction, however late, and in a manner posthumous. Let <lb/>
            him read the records of the ancient philosophers, that at last <lb/>
            he may understand, that I was not the first to make these <lb/>
            researches; but that, long before me, my predecessors Axis. <lb/>

            of Plato, enquired into these matters; and let him know that <lb/>
            they have left many books which treat of the generation of <lb/>
            animals, their diet, their formation, and all their classifications.</p>
          <p>It is fortunate, Maximus, that this cause is tried before <lb/>
            you, who, learned as you are, have no doubt read the numerous <lb/>
            volumes of Aristotle On the Generation of Animals," "On <lb/>
            the Anatomy of Animals," " On the History of Animals be­ <lb/>
            sides innumerable problems of the same writer, as well as <lb/>
            works written by others of the same sect, in which various <lb/>
            matters of the same nature are treated of.</p>
          <p>If it was honorable and praiseworthy in them to write on <lb/>
            these particulars which had been investigated with such scru­ <lb/>
            pulous care, why should it be disgraceful for me to try to do <lb/>
            the same ? And the more especially, when I am making it my <lb/>
            object to write on the same subjects, both in the Greek and <lb/>
            Latin languages, with an improved arrangement, and in more <lb/>
            concise terms, and to ascertain what has been omitted on each <lb/>
            point, or else to supply what is defective? Permit, if you <lb/>
            have the leisure, some of my magical compositions to be read, <lb/>
            in order that Æmilianus may learn that I have made more care­ <lb/>
            ful researches and enquiries than he imagines. Produce* one <lb/>
            of my Greek books, which perhaps my friends have brought <lb/>
            here with them, and which treats on researches into nature, <lb/>
            and that one, in especial, in which are set forth a great number <lb/>
            of facts relative to the class of fishes.</p>
          <p>In the meantime, while he is looking for it, I will just men­ <lb/>
            tion an instance appropriate to the present occasion. Sophocles, <lb/>
            the poet who was the rival of Euripides, and his survivor (for <lb/>
            he lived to a very advanced age), was accused by his own son <lb/>
            of madness, as having, through extreme old age, fallen into a <lb/>
            state of dotage. On this, it is said he produced his (Edipus <lb/>
            Coloneus, the most excellent of his Tragedies, and which he <lb/>
            happened just then to be writing, and having read it to the <lb/>
            judges, he added not a word in his defence, except that he <lb/>
            requested them, without hesitation, to pronounce him mad if <lb/>
            the lines written by him in his old age should show him to <lb/>
            be so. On that occasion, I find that all the judges arose to <lb/>
            pay all due respect to a great poet, and wondrously extolled <note type="footnote"> * Produce.]-He says this to one of the scribes or clerks of court, in <lb/>
            whose hands the documents had been deposited connected with the prose­ <lb/>
            cution. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="285"/>
            him, both for the skill displayed in his plot, and the tragic <lb/>
            elegance of his composition; and it all but turned out that, <lb/>
            on the contrary, they pronounced the accuser mad.</p>
          <p>Have you found the book ? I am much obliged to you. <lb/>
            Come now, let us make trial, whether my literary productions <lb/>
            too will stand my friends in a court of justice ? Read a few <lb/>
            lines at the beginning, and then something on the subject of <lb/>
            fishes. And do you, while he is reading it, take care and <lb/>
            keep the water from dropping.* [The officers read some pas­ <lb/>
            sages from the speaker's physical works, which are now lost.] <lb/>
            You have heard here, Maximus, much that no doubt you have <lb/>
            read in the writings of the ancient philosophers ; bear in mind, <lb/>
            too, that these volumes were written by me on the subject of <lb/>
            fishes alone; in them you will find it stated, which of them <lb/>
            are produced from copulation, which are generated from mud,. <lb/>
            how often, and at what time of the year, the females and the <lb/>
            males of each kind are bent on coupling; in what pacts, and <lb/>
            from what causes, nature has produced a difference between <lb/>
            such of them as are viviparous, and such as are oviparous; <lb/>
            for by those names I denote those which the Greeks call <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ζωοτόϰα</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὠοτόϰα</foreign>.</p>
          <p>And, not to be at the trouble of going through all the genera <lb/>
            of animals, I will next request a few passages to be read from <lb/>
            my Latin compositions, which likewise treat of the same kind <lb/>
            of knowledge, both with reference to their classifications, their <lb/>
            food, their members, their ages, and numerous other particu­ <lb/>
            lars, which, necessary as they are to be known, have but little <lb/>
            to do with a court of justice; in these, you will find, how­ <lb/>
            ever, facts that are known to but very few, as well as some <lb/>
            names that are even unknown by the Romans, and are not <lb/>
            used, as far as I know, up to the present day; they are <lb/>
            names, however, which by means of my labour and study have <lb/>
            been so derived from the Greek, as still to bear upon them the <lb/>
            stamp of the current Latin coinage. If such is not the fact, <lb/>
            then, Æmilianus, let your advocates inform us where they <lb/>
            have read these names set forth as being Latin words. I will <lb/>
            only touch upon aquatic animals, and no other class, except in <note type="footnote"> * Water from dropping.]-He says this to the officer whose charge it <lb/>
            is to watch the clepsydra. The time taken up in reading quotations or <lb/>

            those cases where there are differences of genera in common <lb/>
            with them and others.</p>
          <p>Listen now to what I am going to say. You will presently <lb/>

              the meantime, as to the few that I have mentioned, run over <lb/>
              the names I have given them in Latin. [The Latin names for <lb/>

            school of Plato, which do you think is the more disgraceful to <lb/>

          <p>Q. Ennius, in his work called " Hedyphagetica,"* which <lb/>
            he has written in verse, enumerates the almost numberless <lb/>
            genera of fish which he had, no doubt curiously, examined. I <lb/>
            remember a few of his lines, which I will repeat. <lb/>
            " The best of eel-pouts are at Clypea found ; <lb/>
            At Ænus sea-loche. From Abydos come <lb/>
            Oysters in plenty. Mitylene sends <lb/>
            Her scallops. From Ambracia's rocky shores <lb/>
            We fetch the sea-goat. Good thy sargest are, <lb/>
            Brundusium ; if they're large, make sure and buy. <lb/>
            Know that Tarentum sends of boar-like fish ‡ <lb/>
            The best. Buy sword-fish at Surrentum, buy <lb/>
            Blue fish at Cumæ. But why fail to name <note type="footnote"> * ' Hedyphagetica.']—This seems likely to be the most correct reading. <lb/>
            The meaning will be ' a treatise on good eating.' The following lines are <lb/>
            in a most corrupt state. </note><note type="footnote"> t Sarges.]-It is not known what fish was called ' sargus.' </note><note type="footnote"> t Boar-likefish.]—' Apriculuin.'—It is not known what fish was thus <lb/>

             <pb n="287"/>
            The scarus, equal to the brain of Jove! <lb/>

            The black-tail, sea-thrush, whiting, an I the swift <lb/>
            Sea-shadow,* the Corcyrean polypus ; <lb/>
            Atarna's skull-fish fat, the purpura, <lb/>
            Murex, muriculus ; sweet urchins, too." <lb/>
            Others, besides, he has celebrated in many of his lines, and has <lb/>
            shown in what countries each of them is to be found, and whether <lb/>
            it has the finest flavour when boiled or pickled; and yet, for all <lb/>
            this, he is not censured by the learned. Let me not be censured <lb/>
            then, when I set forth in the Latin tongue, under elegant and <lb/>
            appropriate names, matters which, having been hitherto treated <lb/>
            of in Greek, are known to but very few indeed.</p>
          <p>As I have spoken at sufficient length on this subject, next <lb/>
            hear me on another. Now what can they say against it, pray, <lb/>
            if, being neither unacquainted with the medical art, nor un­ <lb/>
            skilled in it, I seek for certain antidotes in fishes ? for as <lb/>
            very many such are mingled and implanted in all other ob­ <lb/>
            jects by the bounty of nature, so too there are some, no <lb/>
            doubt, to be found in fishes. Do you suppose that to under­ <lb/>
            stand the nature of antidotes, and to search for them, is the <lb/>
            province rather of a magician, than of a physician, or a phi­ <lb/>
            losopher even ? One who is going to use them not for his own <lb/>
            profit, but for the purpose of benefiting others ? Why, the <lb/>
            ancient physicians were even acquainted with certain charms <lb/>
            by way of remedy for wounds, as Homer, that most trust. <lb/>
            worthy author of all antiquity, informs us, when he represents <lb/>
            the blood that flowed from the wound of Ulysses, as being <lb/>
            staunched by means of a charm.t Nothing that is done for <lb/>
            the purpose of ensuring health can be criminal in itself.</p>
          <p>" But then," says he, " for what purpose but a bad one did <lb/>
            you cut up the fish which your servant Themiso brought you?" <lb/>
            As though, indeed, I did not say, a short time since, that I have <lb/>
            written on the parts of all animals, their position, their num­ <lb/>
            ber, and their purposes; and that I make it my study to ex­ <lb/>
            amine and to enlarge the' works written by Aristotle " On <lb/>
            Dissections." And, indeed, I am surprised that you should <lb/>
            only know that one little fish has been examined by me, <note type="footnote"> * Sea-shadow.] —' Umbra marina,' or ' sea-shadow,' so called from <lb/>
            its swarthy colour. </note><note type="footnote"> t Of a charm.-See the Odyssey, Book XIX., et seq. 1. 456. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="288"/>
            when I have in the same manner, on previous occasions, <lb/>
            examined vast numbers of them, whenever they have been <lb/>
            brought to me; especially, seeing that I do nothing in secret, <lb/>
            but everything openly, and any one, a stranger even, may <lb/>
            come and be present, as a spectator. Herein I act according to <lb/>
            the customs and usages of my masters, who say, that a man <lb/>
            of ingenuous birth and high spirit, ought, if he can, to carry <lb/>
            his mind pourtrayed in the very front of his forehead.</p>
          <p>Now this little fish, which you call a sea-hare, I showed to <lb/>
            a great number of persons who were present, and I can not <lb/>
            yet make up my mind what it shall be called, until I shall <lb/>
            have made a more careful examination of it; for among the <lb/>
            ancient philosophers, I find no account of the properties of <lb/>
            this fish, although it is the rarest of all kinds, and, by Her­ <lb/>
            cules ! one that well deserves to be described. For this is the <lb/>
            only fish, so far as I know, that, being without bones in other <lb/>
            parts, has certain bones, twelve in number in the belly, con­ <lb/>
            nected and united one with another, much like the pastern <lb/>
            bones of a pig in appearance. If Aristotle had been aware <lb/>
            of this fact, he certainly never would have omitted to commit <lb/>
            it to writing, since he has mentioned, as a remarkable fact, <lb/>
            that there is a little heart found in the middle of the belly of <lb/>
            the codfish, and of that fish alone.</p>
          <p>" You cut up the fish," says he. Who can endure that being <lb/>
            a crime in a philosopher, which would not have been so in a <lb/>
            butcher or a cook? " You cut up the fish!" Is it because <lb/>
            it was raw, that you censure me for so doing ? If I had ex­ <lb/>
            amined the belly, after boiling the fish, and had dug out the <lb/>
            entrails, just as this stripling, Sicinius Pudens, has learned <lb/>
            to do at your house,* with fish bought with his own pocket- <lb/>
            money; would you not have deemed that a fitting ground <lb/>
            for accusing me ? But know that it is a greater crime for a <lb/>
            philosopher to eat fishes than to examine them. Shall sooth- <lb/>
            navers, then, be allowed to inspect the entrails, and shall a <lb/>
            philosopher be forbidden to observe them, when he knows <lb/>
            that he is the diviner, who gathers omens from all animals; <note type="footnote"> * At your house.]-In this passage, he accuses Æmilianus of neglect­ <lb/>
            ing the duties of an uncle towards Pudens; while he censures the latter <lb/>
            for inordinate epicurism ; as, among nice eaters, the entrails of fish were <lb/>
            generally esteemed the most dainty bits. He seems also to hint, that <lb/>
            Pudens was not over-well fed at the house of Æmilianus. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="289"/>
            that he is the priest of all the Gods ? Do you censure in me, <lb/>
            the very thing that Maximus and I agree in admiring in <lb/>
            Aristotle? whose books unless you banish from the libraries, <lb/>
            and tear them from the hands of the studious, you can bring <lb/>
            no accusation against me.</p>
          <p>But on this point I have almost said more than I ought. <lb/>
            Now, only see to what an extent these people confute them­ <lb/>
            selves. They say, that a woman was captivated by me through <lb/>
            magic arts and charms derived from the sea; this, too, at a <lb/>
            time at which they will not deny that I was far inland among <lb/>
            the mountains of Gætulia, where may be found fishes left <lb/>
            by Deucalion's flood. I really congratulate myself that they <lb/>
            were not aware that I have also read the tract of Theo­ <lb/>
            phrastus, "On animals that bite and are venomous," as <lb/>
            well as the book on antidotes written by Nicander. For in <lb/>
            such case, they would have accused me of poisoning too, though <lb/>
            I have only pursued these studies in imitation of Aristotle, <lb/>
            whose works I have carefully read, my own Plato, in some <lb/>
            measure, encouraging me thereto, when he says, that he who <lb/>
            investigates these matters, "knows things that are godlike <lb/>
            and immortal, if he hits upon the truth."</p>
          <p>Now that their fish story has been sufficiently exposed, <lb/>
            listen to another invention of theirs, quite its equal in folly, <lb/>
            but far more absurd and dishonest. They knew, themselves, <lb/>
            that their fish argument would turn out utterly futile and <lb/>
            worthless, and ridiculous for its singularity. For who ever <lb/>
            heard of fishes being wont to be scaled and boned for magical <lb/>
            malpractices ? On the contrary, they ought rather to have con­ <lb/>
            cocted something with reference to matters more universally <lb/>
            known, and that have already obtained credit.</p>
          <p>For this reason it is, that they have trumped up a tale quite <lb/>
            in accordance with prescribed notions and common report, how <lb/>
            that,-all overlookers being removed-in a secret spot, with <lb/>
            lamp and little altar, I bewitched a certain boy by my incan­ <lb/>
            tations-and how that, a few witnesses being privy thereto, <lb/>
            after he had been enchanted, he fell to the ground, and after­ <lb/>
            wards awoke in a fit of utter bewilderment. No further, <lb/>
            however, than this, did they dare to proceed in their fiction; but <lb/>
            still, that the story might be rendered complete, it was found <lb/>
            necessary to add, that the same boy had, in a spirit of pro­ <lb/>
            phecy, foretold many events, for such, we generally hear, is <note type="footnote"> IT </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="290"/>
            the result of employing incantations. And not only by the <lb/>
            universally received notions of the vulgar, but even by the <lb/>
            authority of learned men, is this miraculous power of boys con­ <lb/>
            firmed.</p>
          <p>I remember, that in the works of Varro the philosopher, a <lb/>
            man who was most intimately acquainted with all learning <lb/>
            and knowledge, I read the following relation among others of <lb/>
            a similar nature :- When the people of Tralles were consult­ <lb/>
            ing the magical art, as to what would be the result of the <lb/>
            Mithridatic war; a boy,* while looking upon the reflection of <lb/>
            a statue of Mercury in the water, uttered a prophecy of a hun­ <lb/>
            dred and sixty lines, setting forth what was about to come <lb/>
            to pass: Furthermore, that Fabius, having lost five hundred <lb/>
            denars, came to Nigidius,t to consult him; on which, certain <lb/>
            boys, who had been inspired by him by means of charms, <lb/>
            pointed out in what place the purse had been buried, together <lb/>
            with some part of the money; how the rest had been distri­ <lb/>
            buted, and how that even M. Cato the philosopher was in <lb/>
            possession of one of the pieces; upon which, M. Cato con­ <lb/>
            fessed that he had received that very coin at the hands of an <lb/>
            attendant of his for the contribution to Apollo.‡,</p>
          <p>These, and other statements, about boys being employed for <lb/>
            magical purposes, I certainly have read in many authors; but <lb/>
            I am doubtful whether to say that such things are possible, <lb/>
            or to deny it. Still, I do think with Plato, that there are <note type="footnote"> * A boy.]—We learn from Mr. Lane, and other travellers in Egypt, <lb/>
            that it is supposed that boys have, in certain cases, the gift of prophecy <lb/>
            or omniscience, and that they can see events passing in other parts of <lb/>
            the world, reflected in a drop of black ink on the finger nail, or palm of <lb/>
            the hand. </note><note type="footnote"> t To Nigidius.]-Nigidius Figulus was a Roman philosopher, famous <lb/>
            for his extraordinary learning. He was noted for his mathematical and <lb/>
            physical investigations, and followed the secrets of the Pythagorean school <lb/>
            of philosophy. He was also famed as an astrologer, and in the Eusebian <lb/>
            Chronicle is called a magician. A letter of Cicero to him is still extant, <lb/>
            in the Epistles, Ad Familiares, Book IV., ep. 13. He is said to have re­ <lb/>
            ceived the name of ' Figulus,' which means a ' potter,' from the circum­ <lb/>
            stance of having promulgated, on his return from Greece, that the globe <lb/>
            whirled round with the rapidity of the potter's wheel. </note><note type="footnote"> ‡ To Apollo.]—It was not considered seemly for the upper classes, <lb/>
            among the Romans, to carry money in the streets. Consequently, the <lb/>
            ' pedissequi,' or ' footmen,' by whom they were attended, usually carried <lb/>
            their purses for them. </note> <lb/>

            certain divine powers which are intermediate both in nature <lb/>
            and locality, between the Gods and mankind, and that these <lb/>
            powers preside over all divinations and miracles of magicians. <lb/>
            And I am further of opinion, that the human mind, and espe­ <lb/>
            cially the uncontaminated mind of a boy, may be lulled to <lb/>
            sleep, and so estranged from the body, as to become oblivious <lb/>
            of the present, being either summoned away from it by the <lb/>
            agency of charms, or else enticed by the allurements of sweet <lb/>
            odours ; and that so, all remembrance of what is done in the <lb/>
            body having been banished for a time, it may be restored and <lb/>
            brought back to its original nature, which no doubt is divine <lb/>
            and immortal, and thus, being in a kind of trance, as it were, <lb/>
            may presage future events.*</p>
          <p>But be this as it may, if any credit is to be given to these <lb/>
            matters, whatever boy is to prophesy, ought, so far as I can <lb/>
            understand, to be of graceful features and of unblemished <lb/>
            body, of quick wit, and fluent in speech; that so, either the <lb/>
            Divine power may take up its abode in him, as in a beseeming <lb/>
            habitation, (if, indeed, it can, under any circumstances, be <lb/>
            becomingly enclosed in the body of a boy ;) or else, his mind, <lb/>
            on being released from the body, may quickly return to its <lb/>
            power of divination ; and that such power being readily within <lb/>
            its reach, and not blemished or impeded by obliviousness, may <lb/>
            be the more easily resumed. For, as Pythagoras used to say, <lb/>
            "It is not out of every log of wood that a Mercury can be <lb/>
            carved."</p>
          <p>If, then, such is the fact, mention the name of this boy, of <lb/>
            sound mind, good health, quick wits, and singular beauty, <lb/>
            whom I have thought proper to initiate in these arts, through <lb/>
            my incantations. As for this Thallus, whom you have named, <lb/>
            he stands more in need of a physician than of a magician. <lb/>
            For he, poor creature! is so affected with epilepsy, that fre­ <lb/>
            quently, as many as three or four times in a day, he falls to <lb/>
            the ground without any incantations whatever, and injures <lb/>
            all his limbs with the blows so received: he has a face, too, <lb/>
            full of ulcers; his head, both before and behind, is covered <note type="footnote"> * Future events.]—This notion is very similar to that of the mesmer- <lb/>
            ists of the present day. This similarity has been recently remarked by <lb/>
            an ingenious correspondent in ' Notes and Queries,' vol. vi., p. 8. The <lb/>
            divine nature and origin of the human mind or soul, will be found fully <lb/>
            discussed in the treatise, ' On the God of Socrates.' </note><note type="footnote">v 2 </note> <lb/>

            all over with bruises; his sight is dim, his nostrils are ex. <lb/>
            panded, and he is quite shaky in the .legs. He would be <lb/>
            the greatest magician of all, in whose presence Thallus could <lb/>
            stand up for any length of time together ; so frequently does <lb/>
            he stagger and fall down under the influence of his disease, <lb/>
            just as though he were fast asleep. And yet you have thought <lb/>
            proper to assert, that he has been made to fall down through <lb/>
            my incantations, because he happened to fall on one occasion <lb/>
            when I was present. Many of his fellow-servants are here, <lb/>
            whom you gave notice to produce. They can tell you, all <lb/>
            of them, why they shun the society of Thallus; why it is that <lb/>
            no one ventures to eat with him from the same dish, to drink <lb/>
            with him from the same cup.</p>
          <p>But why speak of the servants ? Deny it yourselves, if you <lb/>
            dare, that Thallus, long, long before I came to Oëa, was in <lb/>
            the habit of falling down when suffering from attacks of this <lb/>
            disease, and had been repeatedly in the hands of the physicians. <lb/>
            Can his fellow-servants, who are in your own service, deny <lb/>
            that ? I will confess myself guilty on all the charges, if he <lb/>
            has not, this long time past, been banished to a farm at a great <lb/>
            distance in the country, lest he might infect the whole house­ <lb/>
            hold. That this is the fact, not even they themselves can <lb/>
            deny. This, too, has been the reason, why he could not be <lb/>
            produced by us to-day. For, just in accordance with the pre­ <lb/>
            cipitate and hurried manner in which this accusation was <lb/>
            preferred, it was only the day before yesterday, that Æmilianus <lb/>
            gave us notice to produce our fifteen servants before you. The <lb/>
            fourteen who were in the city are present. Thallus, as I <lb/>
            mentioned, is the only one that has been sent away into the <lb/>
            country, almost a hundred miles out of our sight. Thallus is <lb/>
            the only one absent; but still we have sent a person, post haste, <lb/>
            for the purpose of bringing him hither. Enquire, Maximum, <lb/>
            of these fourteen servants, whom we produce, where the boy <lb/>
            Thallus is, and in what state of health; enquire of the servants <lb/>
            of my accusers. They will not deny the fact, that this most <lb/>
            unsightly lad has a body rotten and diseased, that he is liable <lb/>
            to falling fits, is uncouth, and a mere clod.</p>
          <p>A handsome youth, indeed, you have chosen, for any person <lb/>
            to employ in the sacred rites, to touch his head, [in initiating <lb/>
            nim], to clothe him with a pure garment, and to expect him <lb/>
            to give responses! By Hercules ! I only wish he had been <lb/>
             <pb n="293"/>
            here, I would have handed him over to you, Æmilianus, to take <lb/>
            hold of him, and question him yourself. Why, in the very <lb/>
            middle of your examination of him, here, in this same spot, <lb/>
            and before the very tribunal, he would have fixed his staring <lb/>
            eyes upon you, slobbered and spit in your face, clenched his <lb/>
            hands, dropped his head, and, at last, fallen right upon your <lb/>
            breast. The fourteen servants, whom you demanded, I have <lb/>
            brought; why don't you make use of them for examination ? <lb/>
            One lad, and that one a poor epileptic creature, you ask for, <lb/>
            when you know, as well as I do, that he has long since left this <lb/>
            place. How can there be a more manifest calumny than this ? <lb/>
            At your demand, fourteen servants-are here-of them you <lb/>
            take no notice-one young boy is absent, about him you at­ <lb/>
            tack me.</p>
          <p>After all, what is it you want ? Suppose Thallus to be pre­ <lb/>
            sent, do you wish to prove that in my presence he fell to the <lb/>
            ground ? I am quite ready to admit it. Do you say that this <lb/>
            was effected through incantations ? About that, the lad knows <lb/>
            nothing at all: I will prove that such was not the fact. Now <lb/>
            that the lad was suffering from epilepsy, not even you yourself <lb/>
            will dare to deny. Why, then, ought his falling down to be <lb/>
            attributed to incantations rather than to disease ? Could it <lb/>
            not possibly happen that he should be seized with an attack <lb/>
            in my presence, just as he has often been seized on other occa­ <lb/>
            sions, while many other persons were present ? If I had con­ <lb/>
            sidered it a matter of great importance to make an epileptic <lb/>
            person fall down, what necessity was there for me to use in­ <lb/>
            cantations, when the stone called "agate," after being subjected <lb/>
            to the action of fire, as I read in the writers on Physics, readily <lb/>
            and easily tests the presence of this malady ? It is by means <lb/>
            of the smell of this, too, that trial is usually made in the <lb/>
            slave-markets of the soundness or unsoundness of the slaves. <lb/>
            Then besides, the wheel, when whirled round by the potter, <lb/>
            readily affects with vertigo a person suffering from this ma­ <lb/>
            lady, so much does the sight of the rotatory motion affect <lb/>
            his debilitated spirits; so that a potter is much better able <lb/>
            than a magician to cause the epileptic to fall prostrate.</p>
          <p>You have asked, and for no purpose, that I should produce <lb/>
            the servants; I ask, and not for no purpose, that you will <lb/>
            mention by name the witnesses who were present at these ne. <lb/>
            farious rites, when I thus brought to the ground the already <lb/>
             <pb n="294"/>
            tottering Thallus. Only one young lad, after all, do you name, <lb/>
            this Sicinius Pudens here, in whose name you accuse me; <lb/>
            he declares that he was present; but even if his boyhood did <lb/>
            not in the slightest degree detract from his credibility with <lb/>
            the court, still his position as accuser would impair the value <lb/>
            of his testimony. It would have been much easier, .,Emilianus, <lb/>
            and would have carried much greater weight, if you had said <lb/>
            you yourself were present, and that in consequence of these <lb/>
            rites you were first attacked with insanity, rather than entrust <lb/>
            all this business, as though it were a mere joke, to boys.. A boy <lb/>
            fell down,-a boy saw him fall down,-and may not some boy <lb/>
            have acted the enchanter too ? Tannonius Pudens here, craftily <lb/>
            enough, when he perceived that this lying fiction also fell <lb/>
            cold and harmless, and that it was all but hissed outright, as­ <lb/>
            serted that he would produce some other boys who had also <lb/>
            been enchanted by me, that thus at least, by raising your ex­ <lb/>
            pectations, he might lull the suspicions of some among you; <lb/>
            and then he passed on to another head of his argument.</p>
          <p>Now, although I might very well have taken no notice of <lb/>
            this, still, as I have challenged him to proof on all other points, <lb/>
            so I volunteer to do on this. For I long for these boys to <lb/>
            be produced, who, I hear, have been encouraged to give <lb/>
            false evidence against me, through hopes held out to them that <lb/>
            they shall thereby gain their liberty. However, no more <lb/>
            do I say than this: Let them produce them ; I demand, Tan­ <lb/>
            nonius Pudens, and insist that you will fulfil the promise you <lb/>
            have made. Produce these boys, in whom you have put such <lb/>
            confidence; inform us what are their names ; a portion of the <lb/>
            time that has been allotted for my own speech I give you <lb/>
            leave to employ for the purpose. Tell us, I say, Tannonius—; <lb/>
            why are you silent? why do you hesitate? why cast your <lb/>
            eyes on the ground ? If he does not know what it is he has <lb/>
            said, or if he has forgotten the names, then do you, Æmili­ <lb/>
            anus, step this way; say what were the instructions you gave <lb/>
            to your counsel; bring forward the boys ; what makes you <lb/>
            turn so pale ? why thus silent ? Is this the way to bring an <lb/>
            accusation of such magnitude ? to make a laughing-stock of <lb/>
            Claudius Maximus, a man of such exalted station, and to per­ <lb/>
            secute me with your calumnious charges?</p>
          <p>But if, perchance, your advocate did make a slip, and if <lb/>
            you have no. such boys to produce, at all events employ, fot <lb/>
             <pb n="295"/>
            some purpose or other, the fourteen servants whom I have <lb/>
            brought here; or else why was it that you required such a <lb/>
            large household to be brought into court ? Accusing me of <lb/>
            magic, you have given me notice to produce fifteen servants. <lb/>
            If you had accused me of acts of violence, how many servants, <lb/>
            pray, would you have demanded ? Is it, then, that the fifteen <lb/>
            servants know all about it, and yet it is a secret ? or is it <lb/>
            no secret at all, and yet an affair of magic ? One of these two <lb/>
            things you must necessarily confess; either that what I did <lb/>
            was not unlawful, since I did not fear to allow so many per­ <lb/>
            sons to be privy to it, or else that if it was unlawful, so many <lb/>
            witnesses ought not to have been privy to it. This magic, <lb/>
            from all I can learn, is a thing denounced by the laws, and <lb/>
            from the remotest times forbidden by the Twelve Tables, in <lb/>
            consequence of the incredible blasting of standing corn by <lb/>
            means of incantations. Consequently, it is a thing no less <lb/>
            secret in its practices than foul and abominable; it is gene­ <lb/>
            rally carried on by night, hidden in deep gloom, removed from <lb/>
            all observation, and effected by whispered spells: a process at <lb/>
            which few, not to say slaves, but even free men, are allowed <lb/>
            to be present.</p>
          <p>Do you want to make out that fifteen servants were present <lb/>
            as spectators ? Was it a wedding, then, or some other cere­ <lb/>
            monial, or an afternoon carousal ? Fifteen servants are here <lb/>
            taking part in these magic rites, just like so many Quinde­ <lb/>
            cemvirs,* elected for the performance of sacred duties. But <lb/>
            to what end should I have employed so large a number, if the <lb/>
            privity of but one is far more than is requisite ? Fifteen free <lb/>
            men! why, that makes a whole borough.t That amount of <lb/>
            servants ! 'tis a whole household; the same number, if placed <lb/>
            in chains, would fill a whole gaol; t or was it that such a <lb/>
            multitude as this was necessary to hold the victims for sacrifice ? <lb/>
            But all the while you have mentioned no victims except hens. <note type="footnote"> * Quindecemvirs. ]-These were persons whose especial duty it was to <lb/>
            preserve the Sibylline books at Rome. As the text informs us, they were <lb/>

            Or were they required to count the grains of frankincense t <lb/>
            or to knock down Thallus ?</p>
          <p>You stated, besides, that a free-born woman had been <lb/>
            brought to my house, afflicted with the same malady as <lb/>
            Thallus; that I promised to cure her, and that she, too, fell to <lb/>
            the ground enchanted by me. So far as I can see, you have <lb/>
            come here to charge me with being a wrestler, and not a <lb/>
            magician, seeing that you assert in this fashion that all who <lb/>
            have come near me have been levelled with the ground. How­ <lb/>
            ever, upon being questioned by you, Maximus, Themiso, the <lb/>
            doctor, by whom the woman was brought for me to examine, <lb/>
            denied that anything whatever happened to her, except that <lb/>
            I put the question, whether there was a ringing in her ears, <lb/>
            and if so, in which of them in the greatest degree? upon <lb/>
            which she made answer, that her right ear was very much dis­ <lb/>
            turbed by it, and immediately after took her departure.</p>
          <p>And here, Maximus, although at the present moment I am <lb/>
            careful to refrain from praising you, that I may not appear <lb/>
            to flatter you with a view to this trial, still I cannot forbear <lb/>
            from praising your acuteness in cross-examination. For just <lb/>
            now, when these matters were discussed, and they asserted that <lb/>
            the woman was enchanted, whilst the doctor, who was present, <lb/>
            denied it, you very sagaciously enquired, what I was to gain <lb/>
            by thus bewitching her; on which they answered, that the <lb/>
            woman should fall to the ground. " Well, what then?" you <lb/>
            asked, " did she die ?" They said no. " How then," say you, <lb/>
            " what advantage would it have been to Apuleius if she <lb/>
            fell?" For to this effect did you fairly and perseveringly <lb/>
            put the question to them as many as three several times, be­ <lb/>
            cause you well knew that the motives for all actions ought <lb/>
            most carefully to be enquired into, and that often, when facts <lb/>
            are admitted, the causes of them become subjects for enquiry; <lb/>
            and you were aware that for this very reason the advocates of <lb/>
            persons engaged in suits at law have the name given to them <lb/>
            of " causidici," because it is their province to explain the causes <lb/>
            for which each thing has been done. But, on the other hand, <lb/>
            to deny that a thing has been done is an easy matter, and <lb/>
            needs the services of no advocate whatever; while to show <lb/>
            that it has been done rightfully or wrongfully is a most <lb/>
            arduous and difficult task. It is useless, then, to enquire <lb/>
            whether a thing has been done, which has had no evil cause <lb/>
             <pb n="297"/>
            to prompt its being done. Hence it is, that he who is accused <lb/>
            before a conscientious judge of having done a thing, is free <lb/>
            from all fears of enquiry, if he has had no reason for doing <lb/>
            what was wrong.</p>
          <p>Now, since they have neither proved that the woman was <lb/>
            enchanted, nor yet that she was thrown to the ground, and as <lb/>
            I do not deny that, at the request of a medical man, she was <lb/>
            examined by me, I will tell you, Maximus, why I did make <lb/>
            the enquiry about the ringing in the ears ; and I shall do so, <lb/>
            not so much for the sake of exculpating myself in this affair, <lb/>
            which you have already pronounced to have nothing in it <lb/>
            of faultiness or criminality, as because I would not wish to be <lb/>
            silent on any matter that is suited to your ears and your learn­ <lb/>
            ing. I will state it, then, as succinctly as possible, seeing that <lb/>
            you are to be put in mind only, not instructed by me.</p>
          <p>The philosopher Plato, in that most celebrated dialogue of <lb/>
            his, entitled " Timæus," after having, with a sort of celestial <lb/>
            eloquence, explained the structure of the entire universe, most <lb/>
            ingeniously discussed the threefold powers of our mind, and <lb/>
            aptly shown why our several parts were formed by the Divine <lb/>
            Providence, proceeds to range the causes of all maladies under <lb/>
            three heads. The first cause he attributes to the elements of <lb/>
            our bodies, in cases where the qualities of those elements, being <lb/>
            the moist and the cold, and the two qualities that are their <lb/>
            opposites, do not agree the one with the other; and this takes <lb/>
            place when any one of them has exceeded its limits, or has <lb/>
            shifted from its proper locality. The next cause of maladies <lb/>
            exists in the corruption of those parts which are formed by a <lb/>
            coalition of simple elements, united so as to form a single sub­ <lb/>
            stance ; these are, for instance, blood, flesh, bones, and marrow; <lb/>
            and then those parts, which are formed from a mixture of <lb/>
            these several substances. In the third place, there are in the <lb/>
            body collections of various coloured bile, and of restless and <lb/>
            flatulent wind, and gross humours, all which are most frequent <lb/>
            causes of diseases.</p>
          <p>In the number of these last is especially to be found the <lb/>
            primary cause of the falling-sickness, about which I purposed <lb/>
            to speak. For the flesh, through a noxious degree of heat, <lb/>
            sometimes deliquesces into a moist state, that is, dense and <lb/>
            cloggy, and a certain flatulency rises therefrom, in consequence <lb/>
            of the heat of the compressed air, and a corrupt matter of <lb/>
             <pb n="298"/>
            whitish and frothy appearance flows from it. Now, this cor <lb/>
            rupt matter, if it can find a vent to ooze forth from the body, <lb/>
            is ejected with more unseemliness than danger. For it marks <lb/>
            the exterior of the skin with leprosy, and variegates it with <lb/>
            all kinds of spots; the person, however, to whom this happens <lb/>
            is never afterwards attacked by epilepsy; and thus it is that <lb/>
            a most afflicting malady of the mind is compensated by a slight <lb/>
            disfigurement of the body.</p>
          <p>But, on the other hand, if these pernicious secretions are <lb/>
            held in check, and become united with the black bile, these, <lb/>
            raging at large, penetrate through all the vessels; and when <lb/>
            they have done this, making their way towards the crown of <lb/>
            the head, they mingle their destructive humours with the <lb/>
            brain; and instantly affect that regal portion of the under­ <lb/>
            standing which, all-important as it is in the reasoning facul­ <lb/>
            ties, has fixed its seat in the head of man as its citadel and its <lb/>
            palace. For its divers passages and its paths that lead to wis­ <lb/>
            dom, these humours clog up and overwhelm; this, however, <lb/>
            they do with less work during the hours of sleep, as at such <lb/>
            times the patient, being filled with food and drink, only <lb/>
            suffers from a slight attack of impeded respiration, which is <lb/>
            a symptom of epilepsy. But if the humours increase to such <lb/>
            a degree as even to attack the head while the patient is awake, <lb/>
            then, a cloud suddenly comes across the spirit, he becomes <lb/>
            torpid, the breath ceases, and the body falls to the ground, <lb/>
            like that of a dead person.</p>
          <p>This our forefathers styled, not only the "major" and the <lb/>
            " comitial," but also the " divine" disease; just as the Greeks, <lb/>
            with good reason, have styled it <foreign xml:lang="grc">ίερα νοσὸς</foreign>, inasmuch as it <lb/>
            attacks especially the reasoning parts of the mind, which are <lb/>
            by far its most holy portion. You see, then, Maximus, what <lb/>
            is the theory of Plato, which I have explained as perspicuously <lb/>
            as I could, considering the time allowed me; and as I believe <lb/>
            with him, that the Divine disease [or epilepsy] proceeds from <lb/>
            these bad humours mounting to the head, it is clear I had <lb/>
            good reason to make the enquiry, did this woman's head ache, <lb/>
            was her neck torpid and stiff, and was there a throbbing in <lb/>
            her temples, and a tingling in her ears ? And, what is still <lb/>
            more, inasmuch as she admitted that she had a repeated ring­ <lb/>
            ing in the right ear, that was a clear sign that the malady had <lb/>
             <pb n="299"/>
            taken a deep root. For as the right side of the body is the <lb/>
            strongest, the less hope of recovery is there left, when even <lb/>
            that gives way to disease. Aristotle has also left it written in <lb/>
            his Problems, that, in the case especially of those who are <lb/>
            epileptic, and are attacked by the disease on the right side, <lb/>
            the cure will be most difficult. It would take a long time if I <lb/>
            were to repeat the opinions stated by Theophrastus also with <lb/>
            reference to the same malady; but there is in existence an <lb/>
            excellent book of his, written on the subject of epilepsy. <lb/>
            Persons afflicted with this disease, are told in another book <lb/>
            which he has written IOn animals that envy," that the sloughs- <lb/>
            of newts (which those animals, like the rest of the serpent <lb/>
            tribe, cast aside at stated periods, like a sort of old age,) are <lb/>
            very useful as a remedy ; but if you do not quickly take them' <lb/>
            away, these animals will instantly turn round and devour <lb/>
            them, whether it is that they act through a malignant pre­ <lb/>
            sage [of their possible usefulness], or through a natural <lb/>
            appetite.</p>
          <p>These matters I have mentioned, and have been careful to <lb/>
            name both the points discussed and the books written by these <lb/>
            celebrated philosophers, while, at the same time, I have not <lb/>
            thought of giving any of the physicians or poets, in order <lb/>
            that these people may cease to wonder, if philosophers, by the <lb/>
            aid of those studies which are peculiar to themselves, gain <lb/>
            some knowledge of the causes and remedies of diseases. Ad. <lb/>
            mitted, then, that an afflicted woman was brought to me to <lb/>
            examine for the purpose of effecting a cure, and that, by the; <lb/>
            confession of the medical man who brought her, I acted rightly, <lb/>
            then I think, they must either come to the conclusion that it is <lb/>
            the part of a magician, and of a man guilty of malpractices, to <lb/>
            heal diseases, or else, if they do not dare to make such an <lb/>
            assertion, they must confess that, in the case of the boy and <lb/>
            the woman afflicted with epilepsy, they have uttered frivolous <lb/>
            and abortive calumnies.</p>
          <p>Nay, if you wish to hear the truth, Æmilianus, you yourself <lb/>
            are much afflicted with the falling-sickness, having fallen flat so <lb/>
            often in attempts to calumniate me. For it is not a more grievous <lb/>
            thing to fail in body than in spirit, to be found giving way <lb/>
            rather in the feet than in the mind, and to be defiled with <lb/>
            spittle in a private chamber, than to be execrated in this most <lb/>
            illustrious assembly. However, you fancy, perhaps, that you <lb/>
             <pb n="300"/>
            are sane in mind, because you are not confined at home, but <lb/>
            follow your mad fit just where it may chance to lead you. <lb/>
            Still, if you compare your own madness with that of Thallus, <lb/>
            you will find that there is no such great difference between <lb/>
            them, except that Thallus attacks himself, while you go so far <lb/>
            as to attack others. Besides, Thallus distorts his eyes, you <lb/>
            the truth; Thallus screws his hands, you your advocates; <lb/>
            Thallus falls flat on the pavement, you before the tribunal. In <lb/>
            fine, whatever he does, he does through infirmity; he offends <lb/>
            in ignorance, while you, wretched man, knowingly and advi­ <lb/>
            sedly, are guilty.</p>
          <p>So extreme is the violence of the disease that holds its sway <lb/>
            over you, that you accuse me of what is false as though it were <lb/>
            the truth; a thing that was never done, you charge me with <lb/>
            doing; one whom you know, beyond a doubt, to be innocent, <lb/>
            you still accuse as though he were guilty. I have omitted, <lb/>
            besides, to say that there are some things of which you con­ <lb/>
            fess yourself ignorant, and yet persist in charging me with, <lb/>
            just as though you were fully acquainted with them. For you <lb/>
            assert that I kept something wrapped up in a napkin in the <lb/>
            same room with the Lares of Pontianus. What these things <lb/>
            were, thus wrapped up, and what was their nature, you con­ <lb/>
            fess you know not, and you admit there is no one who has <lb/>
            seen them; and yet, at the same time, you assert that they <lb/>
            were appliances of magic.</p>
          <p>. Let no one flatter you, AEmilianus. This is no proof of <lb/>
            your skill in framing an accusation, nor of your effrontery <lb/>
            even; so don't you suppose that it is. What is it then ? It <lb/>
            is the unhappy frenzy of an embittered spirit, the wretched <lb/>
            insanity of a soured old age. For, almost in these very words <lb/>
            did you plead before a judge so distinguished for his gravity <lb/>
            and his shrewdness: " Apuleius kept certain articles wrapped <lb/>
            up in a linen cloth in the same room with the Lares of Pon­ <lb/>
            tianus. As I do not know what these articles were, I assert <lb/>
            that they were for magical purposes ; believe me, therefore, <lb/>
            in what I assert, because I am asserting what I know no­ <lb/>
            thing about." An excellent argument, and one that so con­ <lb/>
            vincingly proves my guilt! " Such and such it was, because <lb/>
            I know not what it was." You are the only person that has <lb/>
            ever yet been found, Æmilianus, to know even those very <lb/>
            things that you do not know. To such a degree as this have <lb/>
             <pb n="301"/>
            you been exalted above all in folly! While, on the one hand, <lb/>
            the ablest and most sagacious of philosophers have asserted <lb/>
            that we must not so much as place confidence in those things <lb/>
            even which we see ; you, on the other hand, go so far as to <lb/>
            assert the existence of things that you have never so much as <lb/>
            seen or heard of. If Pontianus were alive, and you were to <lb/>
            ask him what was within that cover, he would tell you he <lb/>
            did not know. The freed man, too, who has kept the keys of <lb/>
            that place up to this very day, and is one of your supporters, <lb/>
            declares that he never looked into it, although, as being the <lb/>
            keeper of the books which were put away there, he opened and <lb/>
            shut the place nearly every day. Many a time has he gone <lb/>
            into the room with me, and much more frequently alone, and <lb/>
            has seen a linen cloth lying upon the table, without any seal, <lb/>
            without any fastening upon it. And why so ? Magical imple­ <lb/>
            ments were concealed in it--that was the reason why I kept <lb/>
            them in such a careless manner. Still more, I needlessly <lb/>
            exposed them for him to pry into and examine, and even, if <lb/>
            he had thought fit, to take them away; I entrusted them <lb/>
            to the care of another person, I left them at the mercy of <lb/>
            another.</p>
          <p>What, then, is it that you now want to be believed ? That <lb/>
            a thing about which Pontianus, who lived on terms of inse­ <lb/>
            parable intimacy with me, knew nothing at all, you are fully <lb/>
            acquainted with, you, whom, before I met you in this court <lb/>
            of justice, I never in my life set eyes upon ? Or is it that, <lb/>
            when a freedman was there at all times and seasons, and had <lb/>
            every opportunity of examining, you, who never went there, <lb/>
            saw a thing which that same freedman never saw? In short, <lb/>
            do you wish it to be believed that a thing which you never saw, <lb/>
            is just what you affirm it to have been ? But, you blockhead, <lb/>
            if you, this very day, had gained possession of that same nap-<unclear/> <lb/>
            in, whatever you might have produced therefrom, I could have <lb/>
            denied that it was ever employed for magical purposes.</p>
          <p>However, I give you full permission ; invent whatever you <lb/>
            please, plan, devise anything that may possibly appear appli­ <lb/>
            cable to magical practices, I could still dispute the question <lb/>
            with you ; I could either say that it had been surreptitiously <lb/>
            placed there, or that it was employed as a remedy, or that it <lb/>
            had been entrusted to me for the performance of sacred rites, <lb/>
            or had been recommended to me in a dream. There are a <lb/>
             <pb n="302"/>
            thousand other means by which I could, after the most ordi­ <lb/>
            nary methods in use, truthfully rebut your assertions. Now, <lb/>
            this is what you require, that the very thing which, if made <lb/>
            known and discovered, would not prejudice me before an up­ <lb/>
            right judge, may, while it remains undiscovered and un­ <lb/>
            known, lead to my condemnation, upon an idle suspicion. <lb/>
            I don't know whether you will again say, as usual with <lb/>
            you,—"What was it, then, that you kept covered up with <lb/>
            a linen cloth, and so carefully put away in the same room with <lb/>
            the Lares ?" Is it so, Æmilianus ? You make your accusations <lb/>
            in such a way that you gain all your information from the <lb/>
            person accused, while you yourself bring forward nothing <lb/>
            that is known for certain. "For what purpose did you try to <lb/>
            procure the fishes?" "Why did you examine the sick woman?" <lb/>
            " What was it you kept in the napkin ?" Which of the two have <lb/>
            you come here to do, to accuse or to interrogate me ? If to <lb/>
            accuse me, prove yourself the assertions you make; if to in­ <lb/>
            terrogate me, do not prejudge the fact, since the very reason <lb/>
            that makes it necessary for you to interrogate me, is that you <lb/>
            are ignorant of the fact.</p>
          <p>But really, according to this mode of proceeding, all men <lb/>
            will have accusations brought against them, if there is to be <lb/>
            no necessity for one who makes a charge against another to <lb/>
            prove his case, but, on the contrary, he may enjoy every possible <lb/>
            facility for making enquiries. For in such case, charges of <lb/>
            magical practices may be made against any body, and every <lb/>
            thing he may chance to have done, will be brought forward <lb/>
            against him. " You placed your vow in writing upon the <lb/>
            thigh of some statue, therefore you are a magician; if not, <lb/>
            why did you so place it?" " You silently put up prayers <lb/>
            to the Gods in a temple, therefore you are a magician, or else <lb/>
            why did you so express your wishes ?" On the other hand, <lb/>
            " You omitted to pray in the temple, therefore you are a <lb/>
            magician, else why did you not address your supplications to <lb/>
            the Gods?" Just the same may happen, whether you present <lb/>
            some donation, offer up a sacrifice, or take home some of the <lb/>
            sacred herbs.</p>
          <p>The day would not suffice for me, if I were to attempt to <lb/>
            enumerate all the matters on which a calumnious accuser <lb/>
            will thus call for an explanation. In especial, what is put <lb/>
            away in one's house, what is placed under seal, what is <lb/>
             <pb n="303"/>
            shut up, and kept there; all these things, by the same line <lb/>
            of reasoning, will be said to be of a magical nature, or else will <lb/>
            have to be transferred from the store-room to the forum, and <lb/>
            into a court of justice. For my own part, Maximus, I could <lb/>
            discuss at very considerable length the value to be set upon <lb/>
            such points as these, what their character is, how large a field <lb/>
            for calumnious charges is opened by this course adopted by <lb/>
            Æmilianus, and what an enormous amount of trouble* and <lb/>
            vexation has been caused to innocent persons by this one single <lb/>
            napkin. I will do, however, as I originally purposed, even <lb/>
            where there is no necessity that I should do so; I will give <lb/>
            him the benefit of an admission, and, as I have been interro­ <lb/>
            gated by Æmilianus, I will give him an answer.</p>
          <p>You ask, Æmilianus, what it was I had in the napkin. <lb/>
            Now, although I might utterly deny that any napkin belong- <lb/>
            in- to me was ever placed in the library of Pontianus, I <lb/>
            will grant, by all means, that such was the case, as it still <lb/>
            remains in my power to say, that nothing whatever was <lb/>
            wrapped up in that napkin. And if I do say so, by the testi­ <lb/>
            mony of no one, by no proof can I be refuted. For there is <lb/>
            not a person who ever touched it, and only a single freed man, <lb/>
            according to your own story, who saw it. Still I tell you, <lb/>
            so far as I am concerned, I am quite ready to admit that <lb/>
            it was stuffed full of something ; think so, if you like, just as <lb/>
            in days of yore the companions of Ulysses fancied that they <lb/>
            had found a treasure when they fingered the leather bag that <lb/>
            was blown out with the winds.t Would you like me to tell <lb/>
            you what the things were, thus wrapped up in the napkin <lb/>
            which I entrusted to the charge of the Lares of Pontianus ? <lb/>
            You shall be indulged. I have been initiated into most of the <lb/>
            sacred rites of Greece. Certain of their tokens and insignia, <lb/>
            which have been given to me by the priests, I carefully keep <lb/>
            as reminiscences. Of nothing unusual, nothing unheard-of <lb/>
            am I speaking. You, too, brother members of the college of <lb/>
            that single God, father Bacchus, who are here present, you, <note type="footnote"> * Amount of trouhle.]-He puns upon 'sudor,' 'sweat,' and ' suda. <lb/>
            riolum,' a ' sweat cloth,' meaning a napkin or ' handkerchief.' Literally, <lb/>
            the passage would be, and how much sweat has been caused to innocent <lb/>
            persons by this one sweat cloth ?' </note><note type="footnote"> t With the winds. ]-He alludes to the bag mentioned in the tenth <lb/>
            book of the Odyssey, as having been given by Æolus to Ulysses, filled <lb/>
            with winds that would ensure his safe return. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="304"/>
            I say, know full well what it is you keep so carefully trea­ <lb/>
            sured up at home, and what it is that, after excluding the <lb/>
            uninitiated, you venerate in silence. Well, then, I, as I was <lb/>
            saying, in my eagerness for truth and in performance of my <lb/>
            duty towards the Gods, have become acquainted with mani­ <lb/>
            fold rites, usages, and ceremonials. I do not invent this to <lb/>
            suit the present occasion; for nearly three years since, when, <lb/>
            at the very earliest period after my arrival at Oea, I was de­ <lb/>
            livering a public lecture on the majestic attributes of AEscu­ <lb/>
            lapius, I mentioned the very same thing with reference to my­ <lb/>
            self, and reckoned up the number of sacred mysteries with <lb/>
            which I was acquainted. That lecture of mine is very well <lb/>
            known; every body reads it; it is in the hands of all; being <lb/>
            recommended to the religious of Oëa, not so much by my own <lb/>
            eloquence, as by its mention of Æsculapius.* Repeat some <lb/>
            of you, if there are any who happen to remember it, the be­ <lb/>
            ginning of that discourse. [It is repeated] Do you hear, <lb/>
            Maximus, how many are able to quote it? Nay, more, only <lb/>
            look; the book is handed to me. I will request that those <lb/>
            same passages be read; for judging by the very kind expres­ <lb/>
            sion of your countenance, I am fully assured that you will <lb/>
            not object to hear them read. [The passages so read are want­ <lb/>
            ing.] Can it, then, seem wonderful to any man who has any <lb/>
            thought or regard whatever for religion, that a person who has <lb/>
            been initiated into so many sacred mysteries of the Gods, keeps <lb/>
            in his house certain tokens connected with those sacred rites, <lb/>
            and that he wraps them up in woven linen, a substance that <lb/>
            forms. the purest of all coverings for things of a holy nature?</p>
          <p>For wool, being an excrement of a most inert body, and <lb/>
            taken from an animal's back, has ever been held to be an im­ <lb/>
            pure covering, in conformity with the dicta of Orpheus and <lb/>
            Pythagoras; while, on the other hand, flax, the purest pro­ <lb/>
            duction of the earth, and one that springs up from the ground <lb/>
            among the choicest of its fruits, is employed by the most holy <lb/>
            of the priests of the Egyptians, not only for their dress, but <lb/>
            also for the purpose of covering things of a sacred nature. <lb/>
            Still, I am quite aware that there are some, and Æmilianus <lb/>
            here especially, who make a joke of sacred matters, and laugh <lb/>
            them to scorn. For, from what I can learn from some of the <note type="footnote"> Æsculapius.]-This God was the patron deity of Oëa, where he had <lb/>
            a fine temple. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="305"/>
            people of Oëa, who are acquainted with him, up to this pre. <lb/>
            sent advanced period of life, he has offered his supplications <lb/>
            to no deity, crossed the threshold of no temple. If he chances <lb/>
            to pass by any holy place, he holds it an abomination to <lb/>
            move his hand to his lips for the purpose of shewing venera­ <lb/>
            tion. Not even to the Gods of husbandry, who feed him and <lb/>
            clothe him, does this man offer any first-fruits of his crops, or <lb/>
            his vines, or his flocks: no shrine is there built on his estate, <lb/>
            no consecrated spot or grove is there to be found. But why <lb/>
            do I talk about groves and shrines ? Those who have been <lb/>
            there, declare that they never so much as saw a single anointed <lb/>
            stone within the boundaries of his estate, or one branch <lb/>
            crowned with garlands. Hence it is, that two nicknames <lb/>
            have been given him, Charon, as I have mentioned already, <lb/>
            in consequence of the unseemliness of his features and his dis­ <lb/>
            position ; and another, which he likes better, and which is <lb/>
            given him on account of his contempt for the Gods, namely, <lb/>
            that of Mezentius.* For this reason, I can very easily un­ <lb/>
            derstand that these initiations into so many sacred rites will <lb/>
            appear to him to be mere nonsense; and perhaps, in his con­ <lb/>
            tempt for things divine, he will persuade himself not to be­ <lb/>
            lieve me, when I say that I most religiously preserve these <lb/>
            tokens and reminiscences of so many sacred ceremonials.</p>
          <p>But what Mezentius may choose to think of me, not one <lb/>
            snap of a finger do I care. To the rest, however, who are <lb/>
            around me, in my loudest voice I give notice, that if any <lb/>
            one happens to be present who has been initiated into the samt <lb/>
            rites as myself, if he will give me the sign, he shall then be at <lb/>
            liberty to hear what it is I keep with such care. For, so far <lb/>
            as I am concerned, by no peril will I ever be compelled to dis­ <lb/>
            close to the uninitiated the things that I have had entrusted to <lb/>
            me on condition of silence. I have now then, Maximus, to <lb/>
            my thinking, fully satisfied the mind of any man, even the <lb/>
            most unreasonable; and, so far as the napkin is concerned, <lb/>
            have wiped away every stain of suspicion; and I believe I may <lb/>
            now pass on in perfect security from the suspicions of Æmili­ <lb/>
            anus to the testimony of Crassus, which, next to the preceding <lb/>
            matters, they adduced as of the greatest importance.</p>
          <p>You heard read in the information, the testimony of a cer- <note type="footnote"> * Mezentius.]—This contemner of the Gods is mentioned in the Æneid, <lb/>
            as one of the allies of Turnus against AEneas. </note> <note type="footnote"> X </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="306"/>
            tain glutton and desperate debauchee, Junius Crassus by name, <lb/>
            who stated that I had been in the habit of performing sacred <lb/>
            rites at night in his house, together with my friend Appius <lb/>
            Quintianus, who had paid a sum for the hire of that house. <lb/>
            This Crassus affirms, too, that although at that very time he. <lb/>
            was at Alexandria, he still knows this for a fact, from the smoke <lb/>
            left by the torches and from the feathers of birds which were <lb/>
            found there. I suppose he means to say, that while he was <lb/>
            celebrating his orgies at Alexandria, (for this, you must know, <lb/>
            is that same Crassus who delights to creep at midday into <lb/>
            his dens of brothels,) he caught, amid the steams of the <lb/>
            kitchen, the feathers that had been wafted thither all the <lb/>
            way from his abode, and that he recognized the smoke of his <lb/>
            own house, as it curled afar from his paternal roof. If he <lb/>
            really did manage to see it with his eyes, he certainly is blessed <lb/>
            with a power of sight that far transcends the wishes and as­ <lb/>
            pirations of Ulysses himself. Ulysses, for many a year, looked <lb/>
            out in the distance from the sea-shore, and longed in vain <lb/>
            to espy the smoke as it ascended from his native land.* Crassus, <lb/>
            in the few months during which he was absent, without the <lb/>
            slightest trouble, espied that smoke while seated in a wine- <lb/>
            shop.</p>
          <p>And if, too, he managed to snuff up with his nostrils the <lb/>
            fumes that arose from his house, why, then, he outdoes even <lb/>
            dogs and vultures in the keenness of his scent. For by what <lb/>
            dog, by what vulture, under the Alexandrian sky, can any­ <lb/>
            thing possibly be smelt all the way from the confines of Oea ? <lb/>
            No doubt this Crassus is an inordinate glutton, and far from <lb/>
            unskilled in all kinds of fumes; but really, considering his <lb/>
            fondness for drinking, the only thing for which he has become <lb/>
            distinguished, it would be much more easy for the fumes of <lb/>
            wine, than the smell of smoke to reach him at Alexandria. <lb/>
            Even he himself was sensible that this would not be easily be­ <lb/>
            lieved. For the report is, that before the second hour of the <lb/>
            day, with an empty stomach, and before he had taken a drop <lb/>
            of wine, he made sale of this same testimony of his; upon which, <lb/>
            he wrote down that he had made this discovery in the follow­ <lb/>
            ing manner. <note type="footnote"> * His native land.]-He alludes to the passage in the first hook of the <lb/>
            Odyssey, in reference to which, Horace says, that Ulysses ' preferred to <lb/>
            behold the smoke rising from his native land, to gaining immortality.' </note> <pb n="307"/>
            </p>
          <p>Upon his return from Alexandria, he straightway repaired <lb/>
            to his own house, which Quintianus had just quitted: in the <lb/>
            vestibule of it he found a great many feathers of birds, and <lb/>
            perceived that the walls were black with soot. On enquiring <lb/>
            of his servant, whom he had left at Oëa, what was the reason <lb/>
            of this, the servant informed him of the nocturnal rites cole. <lb/>
            brated by me and Quintianus. How very cleverly invented ! <lb/>
            What a very likely story, that, if I had wanted to do anything <lb/>
            of that kind, I should not have done it at my own house in <lb/>
            preference. That Quintianus here, who is now standing by <lb/>
            me, (whose name, in consideration of the strictest ties of <lb/>
            friendship which exist between him and me, of his extraordi­ <lb/>
            nary learning and his most consummate eloquence, I here men­ <lb/>
            tion for the purpose of honouring and extolling him,) that this <lb/>
            same Quintianus, I say, if he was going to have any fowls for <lb/>
            his dinner, or if, as they say, he required them to be killed for <lb/>
            magical purposes, could find no servant to pluck the feathers <lb/>
            and throw them away! Moreover, that the smoke was in such <lb/>
            volumes, that it quite blackened the walls! and that Quin­ <lb/>
            tianus was willing to put up with this dirty appearance in his <lb/>
            room, all the time that he was residing there !</p>
          <p>You make no answer to this, Æmilianus; it is not likely <lb/>
            you would; but perhaps Crassus, on his return, did not direct <lb/>
            his steps to the chamber, but, consistently with his usual prac­ <lb/>
            tice, made straight for the kitchen-stove. But on what ground <lb/>
            did the servant of Crassus form this suspicion of his, that the <lb/>
            walls got blackened in the night time precisely ? or why, that <lb/>
            it was smoke with which they were discoloured ? It is, I sup­ <lb/>
            pose, because smoke that escapes by night, is blacker than the <lb/>
            smoke of the daytime, and so differs from it in its effect! And <lb/>
            then, why should a servant, so full of his suspicions, and so <lb/>
            notable a person, allow Quintianus to leave, without having <lb/>
            the house cleaned out? Why did those feathers, just like so <lb/>
            many lumps of lead, lie there all that time, even till Crassus <lb/>
            had returned ? Ought not Crassus to scold his servant for this ? <lb/>
            No, he has preferred to trump up this falsehood about the soot <lb/>
            and the feathers, because, even in giving his evidence, he can­ <lb/>
            not tear himself from the kitchen.</p>
          <p>And then, why did you read his evidence from the record ? <lb/>
            Where is Crassus himself? Has he got tired of his house, <lb/>
            and returned to Alexandria ? Is he busily engaged in cleaning <note type="footnote"> x 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="308"/>
            down those walls of his ? Or, what is much more likely, is <lb/>
            that gormandizer at this moment laid up with a fit of in-- <lb/>
            digestion? For I, my own self, AEmilianus, saw him no <lb/>
            longer ago than yesterday, here at Sabrata,* publicly enough, <lb/>
            hiccupping away to you, in the middle of the market-place. <lb/>
            Make enquiry then, Maximus, of your clerks of court, although, <lb/>
            no doubt, he is better known to cookshop-keepers than to clerks <lb/>
            of court; still, ask them, I say, whether they have seen here <lb/>
            Junius Crassus, a native of Oea ; they will not say no. There­ <lb/>
            fore, let AEmilianus bring before us this most worthy youth, in <lb/>
            whose testimony he places such confidence. You see what <lb/>
            time of the day it is. I am ready to affirm, that long before <lb/>
            this hour, Crassus has been snoring away dead drunk, or else, <lb/>
            that he is at this moment taking his second bath, and sweat­ <lb/>
            ing off his wine, that he may be ready for a second drinking <lb/>
            bout after dinner. This fellow, though he is quite close at <lb/>
            hand, speaks through the record : not but that he is so utterly <lb/>
            void of shame, that if even he were in your presence, he would <lb/>
            lie, without changing colour in the slightest; but very prp- <lb/>
            bably, from his drunken habits, he has not been able to exer­ <lb/>
            cise even such a slight degree of control over himself, as to <lb/>
            keep sober and await this hour. Or else it is, that Æmilianus <lb/>
            has done this designedly, in order that he might not have to <lb/>
            place him before such scrutinizing eyes as yours; his object <lb/>
            being that you might not, from his appearance, form a bad <lb/>
            opinion of the brute, with his lank jaws, and his sinister aspect; <lb/>
            when you saw his head despoiled of beard and hair, though <lb/>
            he is still a young man, his eyes distilling rheum, his eyelids <lb/>
            swollen, his lips bedewed with slaver, his voice quite cracked, <lb/>
            his hands shaking, as he grinst and belches by turns. All <lb/>
            his patrimony he has long ago devoured, and nothing of his <lb/>
            family possessions is there now left, except one solitary house, <lb/>
            for the purpose of affording him an opportunity of making sale <lb/>
            of his false evidence; and which he has never let at a more <lb/>
            remunerating rate, than in affording this bit of testimony. <lb/>
            For this drunken fabrication of his, he has bartered to <note type="footnote"> * At Sabrata.]-This was a city near Oëa. There is considerable <lb/>
            doubt, however, as to the correct reading of the passage. </note><note type="footnote"> t At he grins.]-This passage is incomplete in the text: though both <lb/>

            JEmilianus for three thousand pieces of money, a fact of which <lb/>
            there is not a person in Oea who is ignorant. Before the bar­ <lb/>
            gain was concluded, we all knew of it, and by giving timely <lb/>
            information, I might have put a stop to it, if I had not been <lb/>
            well aware that so silly a lie would do far more harm to JEmi­ <lb/>
            lianus, who was making purchase of it to no purpose, than to <lb/>
            myself, who could well afford to hold it in contempt. I was <lb/>
            willing that Æmilianus should have to suffer a loss, and that <lb/>
            Crassus should be exposed for the disgraceful character of his <lb/>
            evidence.</p>
          <p>Why, it is no longer ago than the day before yesterday, that, <lb/>
            without the slightest attempt at concealment, the transaction <lb/>
            was concluded, at the house of one Rufinus, of whom I shall <lb/>
            just now have to make mention, the said Rufinus and Calpur­ <lb/>
            nianus acting as the go-betweens and promoters of the trans­ <lb/>
            action. And this part Rufinus was the more ready to act, <lb/>
            because he felt very sure that Crassus would bring by no <lb/>
            means the smallest part of his bribe to his own wife, at whose <lb/>
            intrigues he purposely connives. I perceived you too, Maxi­ <lb/>
            mus, the very moment that the information was produced, <lb/>
            showing, by your looks, that you regarded the whole matter <lb/>
            with contempt; for, with your usual wisdom, you suspected <lb/>
            their plot, and saw that it was a conspiracy got up against me. <lb/>
            And yet, after all, possessed though they are of unbridled auda­ <lb/>
            city and insolent effrontery, not even they have dared to read <lb/>
            through the evidence of Crassus, for they saw that it stunk in <lb/>
            your nostrils, nor have they ventured to place any reliance <lb/>
            upon it. I</p>
          <p>Now this is why I have mentioned these things, not that <lb/>
            with you for my judge, I was frightened by their feathers and <lb/>
            their smoke stains, but that Crassus might not escape unpu­ <lb/>
            nished for his offence in selling smoke* to a country clown <lb/>
            like Æmilianus.</p>
          <p>Then there was a charge made by them, when they read the <lb/>
            letters of Pudentilla. It was about a certain little image, <lb/>
            which they say I ordered to be secretly made, of the most <lb/>
            costly wood, for purposes of magic. They assert, too, that, <lb/>
            although it was the figure of a skeleton, something quite <lb/>
            shocking and horrible, I was in the habit of paying the <note type="footnote"> * Selling smoke.]—A proverbial expression, signifying to ' take in' a <lb/>
            person. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="310"/>
            greatest veneration to it, and calling it by the Greek name of <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">βασιλευς</foreign>, or " king." If I am not mistaken, I am following <lb/>
            their steps in regular order, and unravelling the whole tex­ <lb/>
            ture of their calumnies piecemeal. How can the fabrication <lb/>
            of the image have possibly been secret, as you allege, when <lb/>
            you know so well who was the maker of it, that you have given <lb/>
            him notice to appear ? Look, here is Cornelius Saturninus, the <lb/>
            carver, a man praised among his fellow-citizens for his skill and <lb/>
            esteemed for his character; the same person, Maximus, who, <lb/>
            a short time since, when you carefully enquired into all the <lb/>
            circumstances of the transaction, recounted them with the <lb/>
            strictest fidelity and veracity. He stated that, after I had <lb/>
            seen at his house a number of geometrical figures made of box- <lb/>
            wood, in a very clever and workmanlike manner, I was induced <lb/>
            by his skill to request him to make for me some mechanical <lb/>
            implements, and at the same time gave him a commission to <lb/>
            carve for me the figure of any god he might think fit, and out <lb/>
            of any material, so long as it was wood, that I might address <lb/>
            my prayers to it, after my usual practice. Accordingly, he <lb/>
            tried boxwood first. He also stated that, in the meantime, <lb/>
            while I was in the country, my son-in-law, Sicinius Pontianus, <lb/>
            who made it his study how to gratify me, having obtained from <lb/>
            a most respectable lady, Capitolina by name, some boxes made <lb/>
            of ebony, brought them to him, and requested him to make the <lb/>
            implements of that material in preference, as being rarer and <lb/>
            more durable; remarking that I should be especially gratified <lb/>
            by such a present. In conformity with my son-in-law's request, <lb/>
            he made the articles, as far as the wood of the boxes sufficed, <lb/>
            and was able to complete besides a small figure of Mercury, <lb/>
            by putting the layers of ivory piece by piece one upon another, <lb/>
            in order to give it the requisite thickness.</p>
          <p>As I say, all these particulars you heard from him: added <lb/>
            to which, on examining the son of Capitolina, a most worthy <lb/>
            young man, who is now present, you were told to the same <lb/>
            effect; how that Pontianus asked for the boxes, and how that <lb/>
            Pontianus took them to the artist, Saturninus. The fact, <lb/>
            too, is not denied, that Pontianus received the image when <lb/>
            completed from Saturninus, and afterwards made a present of <lb/>
            it to me. All these matters being clearly and distinctly proved, <lb/>
            what remains after aH this, in which any ground for suspicion <lb/>
            of magical practices can lurk ? Or rather, what is there in <lb/>
             <pb n="311"/>
            the whole matter that does not convict you of a manifest lie ? <lb/>
            You declared that the image was made secretly, while the fact <lb/>
            is, that Pontianus, an illustrious knight, had it made ; and that <lb/>
            Saturninus, a man of respectability and of high character among <lb/>
            his fellow-citizens, seated in his own workshop, carved it <lb/>
            openly and without concealment; while a lady of the highest <lb/>
            reputation aided the work by the present she made ; num­ <lb/>
            bers, too, both of my own servants and of my friends, who <lb/>
            were in the habit of visiting me, knew that it was about to <lb/>
            be made, and that it was made.</p>
          <p>Were you not ashamed to invent such a lie, and to assert <lb/>
            that I had gone all the city over in search of the wood, and <lb/>
            that I had taken the greatest trouble in so doing, whereas you <lb/>
            knew full well that at that very time I was absent, and had <lb/>
            given orders, as was fully proved, that it was to be made of <lb/>
            any kind of material ? Your third lie was, that the figure was <lb/>
            made to resemble a frightful corpse, all lean, or rather fleshless, <lb/>
            quite horrible and spectre-like. Now, if you were aware of <lb/>
            the existence of such an evident proof of magic, why did you <lb/>
            not give me notice to produce it ? Was it that you might be <lb/>
            at liberty to lie as you pleased about a thing that was not be­ <lb/>
            fore the court ? Thanks, however, to a certain habit of mine, <lb/>
            you cannot make this falsehood pass. For it is my custom, <lb/>
            wherever I go, to carry with me the image of some god or <lb/>
            other stowed away among my books, and to address my prayers <lb/>
            to it on festive days, together with offerings of frankincense <lb/>
            and wine, and sometimes victims. Accordingly, when I heard <lb/>
            just now that most impudent fabrication of yours about a ske­ <lb/>
            leton, I requested a person to go, post haste, and fetch from <lb/>
            my lodgings the little image of Mercury which Saturninus had <lb/>
            made for me at Oëa.</p>
          <p>Come, let them see it; handle it, examine it. There it <lb/>
            is before you—the thing that this scoundrel has called a ske­ <lb/>
            leton. Do you not hear the expressions of displeasure so <lb/>
            loudly uttered by all present ? Do you not hear their con­ <lb/>
            demnation of your falsehood ? Are you not at last utterly <lb/>
            ashamed of so many calumnious charges ? Is this a skeleton? <lb/>
            Is this the figure of a spectre ? Is this a thing that you will <lb/>
            persist in calling a demon ? Is this an image adapted to ma <lb/>
            gical practices, or is it one of the usual and ordinary kind ? <lb/>
            Take it, pray, Maximus, and look at it: to hands so pure and <lb/>
             <pb n="312"/>
            so holy as yours a sacred thing is well entrusted. There, now, <lb/>
            just look at it; how beauteous its figure, and how replete with <lb/>
            stalwart vigour; how smiling are the features of the god; <lb/>
            how becomingly does the first growth of down overspread the <lb/>
            cheeks, and how gracefully do the crisped locks peep forth upon <lb/>
            the head from beneath the shelving brim of the cap! How <lb/>
            charmingly do the wings shoot forth above his temples ! How <lb/>
            smartly, too, is the garment laid down in plaits about the <lb/>
            shoulders ! Any one who dares to call this a skeleton, it is <lb/>
            clear that he never sees an image of the Gods; or if he does, <lb/>
            he passes them all in heedless contempt. Any one who takes <lb/>
            this to be the figure of a spectre, is a spectre-stricken being <lb/>
            himself.</p>
          <p>In return, Æmilianus, for this lie of yours, may this Di­ <lb/>
            vinity, who visits the Deities above and the shades below, <lb/>
            bring upon you the enmity of the Gods who dwell in either <lb/>
            realm, and may he thrust upon your vision phantoms of the <lb/>
            dead, all the shades of hell, all the Lemurs, all the Manes, all <lb/>
            the hobgoblins, all the apparitions of the night, all the spectres <lb/>
            of the sepulchres, all the terrors of the tombs-from making <lb/>
            a more intimate acquaintance with which, you are not very <lb/>
            far distant, both in age and in deserts. But as for us, the dis­ <lb/>
            ciples of Plato, of nothing do we .know, except that which <lb/>
            is festive and joyous, consistent with propriety, divine and <lb/>
            heavenly. Nay, more, in its aspirations for what is exalted, <lb/>
            this sect has even explored things loftier than the very heavens, <lb/>
            and has taken up its abode on the convex side* of the firma­ <lb/>
            ment. Maximus knows that I speak the truth, for he has <lb/>
            attentively read in the Phædrus of " the place" which Plato <lb/>
            mentions as "being above the heavens, and upon the back <lb/>
            thereof." Maximus, too, understands full well (to answer you <lb/>
            in relation to the namet) who it is that was called first of <lb/>
            all, not by me but by Plato, by the title of " Basileus," the <lb/>
            first cause, and reason, and primitive origin of universal nature, <lb/>
            the supreme father of the mind, the eternal preserver of ani­ <lb/>
            mated beings, the ever-watchful artificer of his universe. And, <lb/>
            indeed, he is an artificer who knows not labour, a preserver <lb/>
            devoid of anxiety, a father without generation, one compre- <note type="footnote"> * Convex sufe.]—Literally, ' the back of the universe.' </note><note type="footnote"> t To the name.]-Of ' Basileus,' or ' king :' said to have been given <lb/>
            by him to the image. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="313"/>
            hended by no space, by no time, by no name, and therefore to <lb/>
            be conceived by few, to be expressed by none. See, then, I <lb/>
            volunteer to add to your suspicions of my magical pursuits. I <lb/>
            do not answer you, Æmilianus, as to who it is I worship under <lb/>
            the name of " Basileus." Nay, more, even if the proconsul <lb/>
            himself were to ask me who my God is, I should be silent. <lb/>
            With reference to the name, for the present I have said enough; <lb/>
            as for the rest, I am not unaware that some who stand around <lb/>
            me are anxious to hear why I wished the image to be made <lb/>
            not of silver or gold, but of wood especially; and this I be­ <lb/>
            lieve they desire to know, not so much for the purpose of en­ <lb/>
            suring my acquittal as of gaining information, so that they may <lb/>
            have their minds set at ease even upon this little matter, when <lb/>
            they have seen every ground for suspicion abundantly confuted.</p>
          <p>Listen, then, you who wish to know; listen with the closest <lb/>
            attention, as though you heard the very words of the sage Plato, <lb/>
            which are found in his last book, "On the Laws." "It is <lb/>
            right that a moderate man should present offerings in mo­ <lb/>
            deration to the Gods. But as the earth, like the domestic <lb/>
            hearth, is sacred to all the Gods, let no one dedicate that a <lb/>
            second time to the Gods." He gives this prohibition in order <lb/>
            that no private person may presume to erect a temple on his <lb/>
            own property. For he thinks that public temples are sum- <lb/>
            cient for the citizens for the purpose of immolating victims. <lb/>
            He then subjoins, " For gold and silver, both in other cities <lb/>
            and in our own, employed in temples, is an odious thing. <lb/>
            Ivory, too, as proceeding from a body deprived of life, is not <lb/>
            a becoming offering. Again, iron and copper are instruments <lb/>
            of warfare. But of wood, let each person consecrate as much <lb/>
            as he pleases, so long as it is of a single kind, and the same as <lb/>
            to stone, in the temples that are common to all."</p>
          <p>The expressions of assent on all sides, and yours especially <lb/>
            who sit here in judgment, show that I have most fortunately <lb/>
            employed Plato not only as the guide of my life, but as my ad­ <lb/>
            vocate in this trial, whose directions you see me so ready to <lb/>
            obey.</p>
          <p>It is now time* to turn to the letters of Pudentilla, or, in- <note type="footnote"> * It is now time.]-In many editions this begins what is called the <lb/>
            ' Second Apology' or ' Defence of Apuleius.' It is clear, however, from <lb/>
            internal evidence, that the whole speech was delivered on the same oc­ <lb/>
            casion. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="314"/>
            deed, to go a little further back, and retrace all these events, <lb/>
            in order that it may be palpable to all, that if I, who, they <lb/>
            persist in saying, effected an entrance into the house of Puden­ <lb/>
            tilla from motives of cupidity, had thought of any thing like <lb/>
            gain, I ought rather to have always shunned that house, and <lb/>
            an alliance that in other respects has turned out for me so <lb/>
            far from fortunate. It is one, indeed, that would have proved <lb/>
            disastrous to me, had it not been that my wife in herself, <lb/>
            by her many virtues, makes ample amends for disadvantages <lb/>
            so numerous ; for really nothing can you find but disappointed <lb/>
            envy as the prompter of this accusation, and the source of <lb/>
            many previous perils to which I have been exposed.</p>
          <p>But why, even if he really had found me to be a magician, <lb/>
            should AEmilianus have been moved to indignation, when not <lb/>
            only has he never been injured by any act, but not by the <lb/>
            slightest word even of mine, so as to give him a pretext for <lb/>
            taking umbrage and entertaining a desire for revenge ? Nor <lb/>
            yet is it for the sake of renown that he accuses me; the <lb/>
            ruling motive when M. Antonius accused Cneius Carbo; C. <lb/>
            Mutius, A. Albertius; P. Sulpitius, Cneius Norbanus; C.Furius, <lb/>
            M. Aquilius; C. Cario, Q. Metellus. For all these persons, men <lb/>
            of the greatest learning and in the prime of life, made these <lb/>
            their first efforts in the forensic art for the sake of gaining re­ <lb/>
            nown ; and their object was, that by engaging in some cele­ <lb/>
            brated cause they might become known to their fellow-citizens. <lb/>
            But this custom, which, among those of farmer times, was <lb/>
            allowable in rising young men, for the purpose of showing off <lb/>
            the vigour of their intellect, has long since gone out of usage; <lb/>
            and even if at the present day it were in use, it ought to have <lb/>
            been resorted to by him the last of all. For neither would <lb/>
            the boasts of eloquence have become a person so rude and so <lb/>
            unlearned, the desire of glory one so clownish and so uncouth, <lb/>
            nor the practice of pleading causes an aged man with one foot <lb/>
            in the grave; unless it is, perchance, that AEmilianus, in ac­ <lb/>
            cordance with nis severity of manners, has wished to set an <lb/>
            example, and from the very hostility that he entertains to vice <lb/>
            itself, has, in conformity with the unblemished character of <lb/>
            his morals, taken upon himself to make this charge. But this <lb/>
            I could hardly have believed even of Æmilianus, not this <lb/>
            African one, but him who was called Africanus* Numantinus, <note type="footnote"> * Africanus.]—He puns upon the resemblance of the names ' Afer,' an </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="315"/>
            and who had held, too, the office of censor; much less can I <lb/>
            entertain the notion that in this stick here there is any <lb/>
            hatred of crimes, or even so much as a comprehension of what <lb/>
            they are.</p>
          <p>What is the reason, then ? To any one it is as clear as day <lb/>
            that it is nothing else but envy that has instigated him and <lb/>
            his prompter, Herennius Rufinus (of whom I shall have to <lb/>
            speak presently), and the rest of my enemies, to frame these <lb/>
            calumnious charges of magical practices.</p>
          <p>There are five points, then, which it is incumbent upon <lb/>
            me to discuss ; for so many, if I remember aright, have they <lb/>
            objected against me in relation to Pudentilla. Now, the first <lb/>
            point is, their assertion that after her first husband's decease <lb/>
            she would never have married again, had she not been forced <lb/>
            by my incantations; the second concerns her letters, which <lb/>
            they consider to be an admission of magical practices; then, in <lb/>
            the third and fourth places, they have made the objection that <lb/>
            in the sixtieth year of her age she was married to gratify lustful <lb/>
            propensities, and that the marriage contract was signed not in <lb/>
            town, but at her country house. The last and the most odious <lb/>
            charge is that which bears reference to her fortune. Into that <lb/>
            they have with all their might discharged their whole venom; <lb/>
            upon that point they were most especially anxious, and this is <lb/>
            what they have alleged; they say that immediately after we were <lb/>
            married, at her country house, remote from all witnesses, I ex­ <lb/>
            torted from my fond wife this large fortune of hers. All these <lb/>
            assertions I will prove to be so false, so worthless, so unfounded, <lb/>
            and will so easily and beyond all question refute them, that <lb/>
            truly, Maximus, and you councillors, I do very much fear you <lb/>
            will think that the accuser has been engaged and suborned by <lb/>
            me, to give me an opportunity publicly to extinguish the rancor­ <lb/>
            ous hatred with which I have been pursued. Believe me when <lb/>
            I say it, and the event will prove my words true, that I shall <lb/>
            have to take all possible pains that you may not suppose rather <lb/>
            that I have in my craftiness devised, than that they have in <lb/>
            their folly undertaken so frivolous a prosecution.</p>
          <p>Now, while I briefly recount the circumstances of the case in <lb/>
            their order, and force AEmilianus himself to own on what false <lb/>
            grounds he has been induced to hate me, and that he has wan- <note type="footnote"> African by birth, and ' Africanus,' the surname given to P. Cornelius <lb/>
            Scipio Æmilianus, the conqueror of Carthage. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="316"/>
            dered far indeed from the truth, I beg that you will as carefully <lb/>
            as you have already done, or even more so, if possible, consider <lb/>
            cne very origin and foundation of this trial.</p>
          <p>Æmilia Pudentilla, who is now my wife, had, by one Sici­ <lb/>
            nius Amicus, to whom she was previously married, two <lb/>
            sons, Pontianus and Pudens. These children were left orphans, <lb/>
            and under care of their paternal grandfather (for it so hap­ <lb/>
            pened that Amicus died, leaving his father surviving him), <lb/>
            on which she manifested the most exemplary affection, and <lb/>
            brought them up with the greatest care for a period of four­ <lb/>
            teen years. Still, however, it was by no inclination of hers <lb/>
            that, in the flower of her age, she remained so long in a <lb/>
            state of widowhood ; but the grandfather of the children used <lb/>
            all his endeavours to unite her, much against her wish, to <lb/>
            Sicinius Clarus, another son of his, and for that reason he kept <lb/>
            all other suitors at a distance, while at the same time he <lb/>
            threatened that if she should marry a stranger, he would by <lb/>
            his will leave no portion of their paternal property to her <lb/>
            sons. Being a woman endowed with prudence and of ex­ <lb/>
            emplary affection, and seeing this match so perseveringly <lb/>
            proposed to her, she complied, and executed a marriage con­ <lb/>
            tract with Sicinius Clarus, that she might not, through any con­ <lb/>
            duct of hers, be the cause of detriment to her children. How­ <lb/>
            ever, by resorting to various pretexts, she put off the nuptials <lb/>
            until such time as the grandfather of the children had de­ <lb/>
            parted this life, leaving her sons his heirs, and upon the under­ <lb/>
            standing that Pontianus, who was the elder, should be the guar- <lb/>
            than of his brother.</p>
          <p>On being thus set free from this state of perplexity, she was <lb/>
            sought in marriage by men of the highest rank, and she accord­ <lb/>
            ingly made up her mind no longer to remain in a state of <lb/>
            widowhood; for, although she might have been able to endure <lb/>
            the tediousness of celibacy, she was quite unable to bear up <lb/>
            against bodily ailment. A woman of inviolable chastity, who <lb/>
            had lived so many years in a state of widowhood, without <lb/>
            a blemish, without an aspersion on her character, with her <lb/>
            system torpid from her prolonged disuse of the married state, <lb/>
            afflicted with a protracted inactivity of the vital parts, the <lb/>
            interior of her womb disordered—she was often brought by <lb/>
            her sufferings to extreme peril of her life. Both doctors and <lb/>
            midwives agreed that the disease had taken its rise through <lb/>
             <pb n="317"/>
            disuse of the married state, that the malady would gain strength <lb/>
            every day, and her weakness become still greater; and they <lb/>
            strongly suggested that while some hopes of life were still re­ <lb/>
            maining, recourse ought to be had to marriage.</p>
          <p>Other persons, too, approved of this advice, Æmilianus here, <lb/>
            in especial, the very man who, a short time since, asserted <lb/>
            with most audacious falsehood, that Pudentilla never enter­ <lb/>
            tained a thought about marriage, until she was coerced by <lb/>
            me through magical practices ; and that I was the only one <lb/>
            found to violate the flower of her widowhood, a kind of <lb/>
            virginity, as it were, by means of my charms and drugs. I <lb/>
            have many a time heard it said, with very good reason too, <lb/>
            that " A liar ought to have a good memory." Now, did it <lb/>
            not occur to your recollection, Æmilianus, that before I even <lb/>
            came to Oëa, you had gone so far as to write a letter to <lb/>
            her son, Pontianus, who was then grown up, and residing at <lb/>
            Rome, in which you recommended that she should marry? <lb/>
            Give me the letter, will you, or rather hand it to him; let <lb/>
            him read it; by his own voice and by his own words let him <lb/>
            convict himself. [He reads the beginning of the letter.] Is <lb/>
            not that your own writing ? Why do you turn pale ? for <lb/>
            blush you decidedly cannot. Is not this your signature ? <lb/>
            Read it, I beg, and aloud, too, so that all may understand what <lb/>
            a vast difference there is between this man's tongue and his <lb/>
            hand, and how much less he disagrees with me than with <lb/>
            himself. [The clerk of court reads the rest of the letter.]</p>
          <p>Were you not the writer, Æmilianus, of these words which <lb/>
            have been read? "I know that she wishes and ought to <lb/>
            marry; but whom she may choose, I do not know." Quite <lb/>
            right, no doubt you did not know. For Pudentilla, being <lb/>
            well aware of your spiteful malignity, only thought proper <lb/>
            to inform you of the fact, but said nothing at all about a <lb/>
            suitor. You, however, deluded by vain hopes that she would <lb/>
            marry your brother Clams, even went so far as to advise her <lb/>
            son Pontianus to consent to her marriage. Consequently, if she <lb/>
            had made choice of Clarus, a clownish* and decrepit old man, <lb/>
            you would have been ready to assert that, quite spontaneously, <lb/>
            and without any magical practices whatever, she had long been <lb/>
            anxious to marry; but as she has made choice of such a youth <lb/>
            as you talk of, you affirm that it was by compulsion she did so, <lb/>
            and that, otherwise she always entertained an aversion to <lb/>
             <pb n="318"/>
            marriage. You little thought, dishonest man, that your letter <lb/>
            on this matter had been preserved; you little thought that <lb/>
            you were going to be convicted on your own testimony. Pu­ <lb/>
            dentilla, however, knowing full well how fickle and change­ <lb/>
            able you were, and how untruthful and shameless to boot, <lb/>
            thought it better to keep this letter than to part with it, as an <lb/>
            evidence of your own wishes on the subject.</p>
          <p>Besides, she herself wrote to her son, Pontianus, while he <lb/>
            was at Rome, on the same subject, and entered very fully too <lb/>
            upon the causes that prompted her to take this resolution. <lb/>
            She mentioned to him all the matters connected with her <lb/>
            health, that besides there was no reason why she should per­ <lb/>
            sist any longer in remaining unmarried; she reminded him, <lb/>
            how that, disregarding her own welfare, she had, by her pro­ <lb/>
            longed state of widowhood; obtained for them their grand­ <lb/>
            father's property, and had with the most scrupulous carefulness <lb/>
            increased the same; that, thanks to the Gods, he himself was <lb/>
            now of marriageable estate, and his brother ready to assume <lb/>
            the manly gown: * that they ought now at last to allow her to <lb/>
            find some alleviation for her state of solitude and sickliness: <lb/>
            that they need be under no apprehension as to the constancy <lb/>
            of her affection, and her remembering them in her last will: <lb/>
            that such as she had shown herself towards them while a <lb/>
            widow, she would still prove when a wife. I will request the <lb/>
            copy of this letter to be read, which she sent to her son. [The <lb/>
            copy of the letter of Pudentilla to her son Pontianus is read. ]</p>
          <p>I think that from this letter it may be quite manifest to <lb/>
            any one that it was not by any incantations of mine that <lb/>
            Pudentilla was prevailed upon to abandon her prolonged state <lb/>
            of widowhood, but that having been for a long time not averse <lb/>
            to marriage, she perchance preferred me to the rest. And I <lb/>
            really do not see why this choice made by a woman of such <lb/>
            respectability, ought to be imputed to me as a crime, rather <lb/>
            than an honor. But I do wonder that Æmilianus and Rufinus <lb/>
            take amiss this decision of the lady, when those persons who <lb/>
            aspired to the hand of Pudentilla bear with resignation the <lb/>
            fact that I was preferred to them. Besides, in so doing, she <lb/>
            rather consulted her son's wishes, than her own feelings on <lb/>
            the subject. That such was the fact, not even AEmilianus can <lb/>
            deny. <note type="footnote"> * The manly gown.]-The 'toga virulis,' assumed by youths at the age <lb/>
            of seventeen. </note> <pb n="319"/>
            </p>
          <p>For Pontianus, on receiving his mother's letter, instantly <lb/>
            flew hither with all haste from Rome, being greatly afraid, <lb/>
            if she should take some greedy fellow for a husband, she would <lb/>
            be carrying off everything, as too frequently is the case, to her <lb/>
            husband's house. This anxiety influenced his feelings in no <lb/>
            slight degree : for all the hopes of himself and of his brother <lb/>
            were centred in possessing the property of their mother. <lb/>
            Their grandfather had left a small property, their mother's <lb/>
            possessions amounted in value to four millions of sesterces. <lb/>
            Out of this sum she did, no doubt, owe some money to her <lb/>
            sons, which she had borrowed from them without giving any <lb/>
            vouchers, but simply on her own credit. These apprehensions <lb/>
            of his he kept secret; for he did not dare openly to offer op­ <lb/>
            position, lest he should seem to distrust her. While mat­ <lb/>
            ters were in this state, the mother being wooed, and the son <lb/>
            racked with apprehensions, whether it was by chance, or by a <lb/>
            kind of fatality, I happened to arrive there, being on my road <lb/>
            to Alexandria. " By Hercules, I only wish it had never so <lb/>
            happened," I might add, if respect for my wife did not pro- <lb/>
            vent me. It was the winter season. Fatigued by the journey, <lb/>
            I made a stay of several days at the house of the Appii, old <lb/>
            friends of mine, whose names I mention to testify for them <lb/>
            my honor and my esteem. While I was staying there, Pon­ <lb/>
            tianus called upon me; for, some few years before, he had <lb/>
            been introduced to me at Athens, by some common friends of <lb/>
            ours, and had been subsequently united to me by ties of the <lb/>
            strictest intimacy. He was in everything sedulous to testify <lb/>
            his respect for me, to promote my welfare, and dexterously to <lb/>
            prompt my affections. For he thought that in me he had now <lb/>
            found a very suitable husband for his mother, and one to whom <lb/>
            he might, without any risk, entrust the welfare of the family.</p>
          <p>He began to sound my inclination by hints, and as he per­ <lb/>
            ceived that I was intent upon pursuing my travels, and averse <lb/>
            to wedlock, he begged that I would at least make a short stay. <lb/>
            He said that it was his wish to accompany me, that it was un­ <lb/>
            advisable then to proceed on account of the burning heat of <lb/>
            [the sands of] the Syrtis, and the wild beasts that infested <lb/>
            it, and that as my bad state of health had deprived me of the <lb/>
            present winter, it would be as well to wait for the next. By <lb/>
            force of entreaties, he withdrew me from the house of my <lb/>
            friends, the Appii, to transfer me to his mother's abode, as <lb/>
             <pb n="320"/>
            likely to prove a more healthy place of residence for me; be­ <lb/>
            sides, I should be able from her house to enjoy a very exten­ <lb/>
            sive view of the sea, a thing that for me has especial charms. <lb/>
            He urged these considerations with great earnestness, and in­ <lb/>
            troduced to me his mother and his brother, this same youth. <lb/>
            They received some assistance from me in their common studies, <lb/>
            and the intimacy increased apace. In the meantime I re­ <lb/>
            covered my health, and at the request of my friends I gave a <lb/>
            public lecture. All who were present in the thronged basilica,* <lb/>
            the place appointed for its delivery, cried out with one accord, <lb/>
            requesting that I would remain there, and become a citizen of <lb/>
            Oea. When the audience had departed, Pontianus addressed <lb/>
            me, and began by saying that he interpreted this accordance in <lb/>
            the public voice as an omen from heaven. Then he disclosed <lb/>
            to me that it was his own wish, if I had no objection, to unite <lb/>
            me to his mother, whom a great many persons were eager to <lb/>
            obtain; seeing that, as he said, I was the only person in whom <lb/>
            he placed entire trust and confidence. Would I take upon me <lb/>
            that incumbrance ? for it was no pretty maiden he offered me, <lb/>
            but a woman, the mother of children, and of homely features. <lb/>
            If, on thinking over these things, I should reserve myself for <lb/>
            some other match, with the view of gaining beauty or riches, <lb/>
            he would neither take me for a friend nor a true philosopher.</p>
          <p>My speech would be far too long, were I to relate what I <lb/>
            stated to him in answer; at what length, and how frequently <lb/>
            the subject was discussed by us; with what repeated and earnest <lb/>
            entreaties he plied me; and how he never ceased till he had <lb/>
            finally gained his point. Not but that having now lived in <lb/>
            the same house with her a whole year, I had become tho­ <lb/>
            roughly acquainted with Pudentilla's character, and had dis­ <lb/>
            covered her virtuous endowments; still, as I was anxious to <lb/>
            travel, I declined for some time to marry, as being likely to <lb/>
            prove an impediment to my design. Before very long, how­ <lb/>
            ever, I was no more disinclined to take such a woman for my <lb/>
            wife, than if I had sought her of my own accord.</p>
          <p>Pontianus, too, had prevailed upon his mother to choose me <lb/>
            in preference to all others, and showed incredible anxiety to <lb/>
            bring it about as soon as possible. It was with difficulty <lb/>
            we obtained of him even a short respite, until such time as he <note type="footnote"> * Basilica.]—The ' basilica' was a large building, where public meet­ <lb/>
            ings were held, and the magistrates sat in judgment. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="321"/>
            himself should have married, and his brother have assumed <lb/>
            the manly gown; after which we agreed to be united in mar­ <lb/>
            riage. I wish, by Hercules! it were possible, without the <lb/>
            greatest injury to my cause, to pass over the matters which <lb/>
            I am obliged next to mention, that I might not appear now to <lb/>
            accuse Pontianus of fickleness, whom I forgave freely and with­ <lb/>
            out reserve, when he asked forgiveness for his error. For I <lb/>
            am ready to confess a thing that has been brought forward as <lb/>
            a charge against me, that, after he was married, he was guilty <lb/>
            of a breach of that fidelity which he had pledged to me, <lb/>
            and that, suddenly changing his mind, he endeavoured with <lb/>
            equal pertinacity to prevent that which he had before endea­ <lb/>
            voured with the greatest zeal to promote--that, in fact, he was <lb/>
            ready to submit to anything, to do anything, in order that our <lb/>
            marriage might not take place. And still, all this unbecoming <lb/>
            change of mind on his part, and this ill-will against his mo­ <lb/>
            ther, ought not to be imputed as a fault to him, but rather to <lb/>
            his father-in-law, who stands there, Herennius Rufinus, a man <lb/>
            who has left not one individual upon the face of the earth more <lb/>
            vile, more dishonest, or more iniquitous than himself. ,</p>
          <p>In a very few words, as I am necessitated so to do, I will <lb/>
            describe the man, but still in language as moderate as I pos­ <lb/>
            sibly can; lest, if I should be altogether silent about him, he <lb/>
            should have lost his pains, in using his utmost endeavours <lb/>
            to create for me all this trouble. For it is he who is the <lb/>
            instigator of this stripling; it is he who is the prompter of <lb/>
            this prosecution; it is he who is the hirer of these advocates; it <lb/>
            is he who is the suborner of these witnesses; it is he who is <lb/>
            the furnace wherein this calumny has been annealed; it is he <lb/>
            who acts as the torch and the goad of Æmilianus here; while <lb/>
            in the presence of all, he boasts most immoderately that it is <lb/>
            through his machinations that I have been accused. And, no <lb/>
            doubt, he has in these matters very good grounds for congra­ <lb/>
            tulating himself. For he is the base contractor of all litigation, <lb/>
            the inventor of all falsehoods, the framer of all pretences, the hot­ <lb/>
            bed of all mischiefs; he, too, is a very haunt, a den, a brothel for <lb/>
            lusts and debaucheries; from his very earliest age he has been <lb/>
            universally notorious for his disgraceful vices. Formerly, in <lb/>
            his boyhood, before he was disfigured by that baldness of his, <lb/>
            he was subservient to his corruptors in the perpetration of every <lb/>
            infamous crime; after that, in his youth, as a dancer on the <note type="footnote"> y </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="322"/>
            stage, he was so pliant in body as to seem to be utterly with­ <lb/>
            out bones and nerves ; but, from what I hear, he was remark­ <lb/>
            able for a coarse and uncouth effeminacy. Indeed, he is said <lb/>
            to have had nothing whatever of the actor, except the immo­ <lb/>
            desty. At his present age, too, the years at which he has <lb/>
            now arrived-may the Gods confound him!—high commen­ <lb/>
            dations these to be uttered in his hearing-his whole house <lb/>
            is a brothel, his entire household a mass of corruption, himself <lb/>
            devoid of all shame, his wife a prostitute, his sons just like <lb/>
            himself. His door, a sport, day and night, for the young men <lb/>
            of the place, is battered by their heels, his windows serenaded <lb/>
            by their ditties, his dining-room kept in an uproar by revellers, <lb/>
            and his bed-chamber a common thoroughfare for adulterers ; <lb/>
            nor, in fact, has any one the least fear to enter it, with the ex­ <lb/>
            ception of, him who has brought no admission-fee to the hus­ <lb/>
            band. In this way is the dishonor of his bed a source of in­ <lb/>
            come to him. Formerly he used to earn money by his own <lb/>
            person; now he earns it by letting out the person of his <lb/>
            wife.</p>
          <p>With this same man, many a one—I am telling no falsehood <lb/>
            -with this same man, I say, many a one has bargained for <lb/>
            a night with his wife. Hence, then, that collusion which is <lb/>
            so notorious between the husband and the wife. When people <lb/>
            have brought a handsome compliment for the woman, no one <lb/>
            takes any notice of them, and they take their departure at their <lb/>
            own time and pleasure. But as for those who have come not <lb/>
            so well supplied, on a signal given, they are seized as adul­ <lb/>
            terers ; and, as though they had come for the purpose of learn­ <lb/>
            ing a lesson, they do not get away before they have done a <lb/>
            little writing.*</p>
          <p>But really what was the wretched man to do when he had <lb/>
            lost a very handsome fortune-one, however, which he had <lb/>
            quite unexpectedly picked up through his father's fraudulent <lb/>
            proceedings ? This father of his, being eaten up by usurious <lb/>
            debts due to a great number of creditors, preferred to save <lb/>
            his money rather than his honor. For when he was dunned <lb/>
            on all sides on his bonds, and clutched hold of by all who <lb/>
            met him, just as though he had been a madman—"Have <lb/>
            patience," he exclaimed; and then he declared it was not in <note type="footnote">* A little writing.]-They are forced, under fear of maltreatment, to <lb/>
            give a promissory-note, or a cheque upon their bankers. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="323"/>
            his power to pay his debts; laid aside his gold rings and all <lb/>
            the insignia of his rank, and made a composition with his <lb/>
            creditors. But, by a most artful fraud, he managed to trans­ <lb/>
            fer the greater part of his property into the name of his wife ; <lb/>
            and so, himself in want, and stripped naked, though covered <lb/>
            with his ignominy, he left to Rufinus here—I am telling no <lb/>
            falsehood in so saying-three millions of sesterces for him to <lb/>
            devour. For fully that sum came to him as his mother's pro­ <lb/>
            perty, free and unencumbered, besides all that his wife has <lb/>
            earned for him by her marriage-portions* from day to day. <lb/>
            All these sums, however, this gluttonous wretch has so care­ <lb/>
            fully stowed away in his paunch, and squandered upon his <lb/>
            orgies of all kinds, that you would really suppose he was afraid <lb/>
            lest it might be said that he retained possession of anything <lb/>
            that was the result of his father's frauds. This man, so just <lb/>
            and so pure in his morals, used his utmost endeavours that <lb/>
            what was so badly gotten should be as badly lost; and, from <lb/>
            being the possessor of this enormous fortune, he has nothing <lb/>
            left, except a wretched ambition and an insatiate appetite.</p>
          <p>As for his wife, being now an old woman and nearly worn <lb/>
            out, she has at last given up her disgraceful courses. And then, <lb/>
            as for his daughter, after having, to no purpose, at the insti­ <lb/>
            gation of her mother, gone the round of all the rich young men, <lb/>
            and after having been lent even to some of her suitors for them to <lb/>
            make trial of her, if she had not fallen in with the good-natured, <lb/>
            easy tempered Pontianus, she would perhaps have been still <lb/>
            sitting at home a widow before she was a wife. Although we <lb/>
            most strongly dissuaded him from doing so, Pontianus con­ <lb/>
            ferred on her the false and misplaced name of wife, not being <lb/>
            unaware that, shortly before he married her, she had been de­ <lb/>
            serted by a young man of the highest respectability, who had <lb/>
            become tired of her, and to whom she had been previously <lb/>
            engaged.</p>
          <p>Accordingly, his new-married wife came home to him full <lb/>
            of assurance, and unabashed, with her chastity rifled, her vir­ <lb/>
            ginity lost, her nuptial veil all sullied; after her so recent re­ <lb/>
            pudiation, a virgin once more, but bringing with her rather <lb/>
            the name than the unblemished character of a maid. In a <lb/>
            litter supported by eight persons was she borne along. You <note type="footnote"> * Her marriage-portions.]—That is to say, the presents received by <lb/>
            her from her paramours. </note> <note type="footnote"> T 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="324"/>
            saw,- no doubt, you who were present, how shamelessly she <lb/>
            stared about her at the young men, how immodestly she ex­ <lb/>
            posed herself. Who was there that did not recognize the mo­ <lb/>
            ther's training, when, in the daughter, he beheld the face be- <lb/>
            plastered with cosmetics, the rouged cheeks, and the ogling <lb/>
            eyes ? The very day before, her entire fortune was swept <lb/>
            away by a creditor, to the utmost farthing, and certainly a <lb/>
            larger one than a house impoverished and full of children <lb/>
            would bespeak.*</p>
          <p>However, this fellow, whose circumstances are as limited as <lb/>
            his hopes are inordinate, his avarice being commensurate with <lb/>
            his neediness, had in his vain anticipations gulped up the whole <lb/>
            four million sesterces belonging to Pudentilla; and therefore, <lb/>
            as he thought that I ought to be got out of the way, in order <lb/>
            that he might more easily practise upon the pliable disposition <lb/>
            of Pontianus and the solitary state of Pudentilla, he began to <lb/>
            rate his son-in-law for having engaged his mother to me; <lb/>
            prompted him, while yet he had the opportunity, as speedily <lb/>
            as possible, to extricate her foot from such great peril; told <lb/>
            him that he himself ought to possess his mother's property, <lb/>
            rather than purposely hand it over to a stranger; and in case he <lb/>
            should decline to do so, this crafty knave alarmed the ena­ <lb/>
            moured youth by threatening that he would take home his <lb/>
            daughter. Why enlarge upon the subject? At his own will <lb/>
            he led the simple-minded youth, entangled in the allure­ <lb/>
            ments of his new-made bride, quite away from his original <lb/>
            design. Carrying with him the words of Rufinus, he goes <lb/>
            straight to his mother. However, after trying in vain to <lb/>
            shake her constancy, after taking upon himself to censure her <lb/>
            for levity and fickleness, he had to carry back no pleasing re­ <lb/>
            port to his father-in-law: that, contrary to her extremely <lb/>
            mild and imperturbable disposition, his mother had been <lb/>
            roused to anger by his expostulations, which served in no <lb/>
            slight degree to support her in her obstinate determination: <lb/>
            that, finally, she declared she was by no means unaware <lb/>
            that it was through the advice of Rufinus he expostulated <lb/>
            with her, for which reason she should be all the more in- <note type="footnote"> * Would bespeak.]-' Postulabat.' This seems to be the meaning of <lb/>
            the passage ; and the speaker would almost appear to hint that the in­ <lb/>
            tended fortune of the daughter of Rufinus was a very large one, but only <lb/>
            -upon paper. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="325"/>
            dined to obtain the protection of a husband against his despe­ <lb/>
            rate avarice.</p>
          <p>On hearing these words, this pander to his wife so swelled <lb/>
            with anger, so blazed with rage, that in the presence of her <lb/>
            own son he said things against this lady, a woman of most <lb/>
            chaste and modest character, which would have been far <lb/>
            more befitting his own chamber, and shouted out that she <lb/>
            was a love-sick creature, and I was a magician and sorcerer; <lb/>
            and this in the hearing of many persons, whom, if you desire <lb/>
            it, I will name ; and declared that with his own hand he would <lb/>
            put an end to me. Hardly, by Hercules! can I moderate my <lb/>
            anger, so great is the indignation which rises in my mind. <lb/>
            What, you, you most effeminate wretch! do you threaten death <lb/>
            to be dealt with your hand to any man ? With what hand, <lb/>
            pray ? Is it the hand of Philomela ? or of Medea ? or of Cly­ <lb/>
            temnestra ? whom, when you personate in the dance, such is <lb/>
            the effeminacy of your disposition, such is your dread of steel, <lb/>
            that you are afraid to dance with the mimic sword.*</p>
          <p>But, not to digress any further, when Pudentilla saw that <lb/>
            her son was corrupted contrary to her expectations, she went <lb/>
            into the country, and there wrote to him that famous letter of <lb/>
            hers, in which, as they said, she admitted that she had been <lb/>
            bereft of her senses and induced to love me through my <lb/>
            magical practices. And yet this very letter, by your order, <lb/>
            Maximus, I copied at length the day before yesterday, in pre­ <lb/>
            sence of the public registrar, and before witnesses, Æmilianus <lb/>
            taking a copy at the same time; and in every point it is found <lb/>
            to tell in my favour, and against their accusations. For even <lb/>
            if she had distinctly called me a magician, it might seem that <lb/>
            in excusing herself to her son, she preferred to do so rather on <lb/>
            the ground of my irresistibleness than of her own inclination. <lb/>
            Is Phædra the only woman that ever wrote an untrue letter on <lb/>
            the subject of love ? Is not this a common artifice with all <lb/>
            females, to try and make it appear that they act by compul­ <lb/>
            sion, when they have once set their minds upon any thing <lb/>
            of this nature ?</p>
          <p>And even if she did in her own mind think that I was a <lb/>
            magician, am I any the more a magician, because Pudentilla <note type="footnote"> * Mimic sword.]—' Cludine.' The ' cluden' was a sword or dagger <lb/>
            used on the stage, and so contrived that, in seeming to penetrate the body, <lb/>
            the blade fell into the hilt. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="326"/>
            , has written to that effect? You, by your numerous argu­ <lb/>
            ments, your multitude of witnesses, your lengthy oration, <lb/>
            fail to prove that I am a magician; was she by a single ex­ <lb/>
            pression of hers to prove it ? And yet of how much greater <lb/>
            weight ought a charge to be considered which is undertaken <lb/>
            to be proved in a court of justice, than an assertion merely <lb/>
            made in a letter ? But why do you not convict me by my own <lb/>
            actions, and not by the words of another person ? Henceforth, <lb/>
            on the same principle, many will be accused of all sorts of <lb/>
            offences, if things are to be held as true which anybody, <lb/>
            influenced by love or by hatred of another, has written in a <lb/>
            letter. Pudentilla has written that you are a magician, <lb/>
            therefore you are a magician. Suppose she had written that <lb/>
            I was a consul, would it follow that I really am a consul ? <lb/>
            And what if a painter, what if a physician ? what, in fine, if <lb/>
            she had said I was innocent? would you have believed her in any <lb/>
            one of these assertions, merely because she said So.? In none <lb/>
            of them, no doubt. Well, but it is most unjust to give credit <lb/>
            for evil to one to whom you would decline to give the same <lb/>
            credit for good; to allow his letters to have power to injure, <lb/>
            and yet not to have power to save. " But her feelings <lb/>
            were racked with anxiety," you say; "she loved you to <lb/>
            distraction." For the moment, I will grant it. Is it the <lb/>
            fact, then, that all who are beloved are magicians, if the <lb/>
            person who loves happens to write to that effect ? You must <lb/>
            admit, now, that at this period Pudentilla did not love me, <lb/>
            inasmuch as she wrote that to others which was destined <lb/>
            to be to my prejudice before the public. In fine, which do <lb/>
            you wish to assert, that she was sane, or that she was insane, <lb/>
            when she wrote the letter ? Sane, do you say ? then she has <lb/>
            suffered nothing from my magical practices. Insane, will <lb/>
            you answer ? then she did not know what it was she wrote, <lb/>
            and therefore we must put no faith in her assertion.</p>
          <p>And then, besides, if she had been insane, she would not <lb/>
            have known that she was insane. For in the same way that <lb/>
            the person acts absurdly who says that he is silent, because in <lb/>
            the very act of saying that he is silent, he is not silent, and by <lb/>
            his very affirmation he contradicts what he affirms: so, even <lb/>
            more self-contradictory is the expression, "I am insane," be­ <lb/>
            cause it is not true, unless he who says it knows what it is to be <lb/>
            insane. But he who knows what insanity is, is sane; whereas <lb/>
             <pb n="327"/>
            insanity can no more be sensible of its own existence, than <lb/>
            blindness can see itself. Consequently, Pudentilla, if she <lb/>
            fancied that she was not in her senses, was quite in her senses. <lb/>
            I could, if I chose, enlarge upon the subject, but I will now <lb/>
            have done with logic. I will have the letter itself read, which <lb/>
            cries aloud to a far different effect, and which seems as though <lb/>
            it had been prepared and framed for the very purpose of this <lb/>
            trial. Take it and read on until I interrupt you. [Part of the <lb/>
            letter of Pudentilla is read.] Cease reading for a moment, for <lb/>
            we have now arrived at the turning point in this matter.</p>
          <p>Thus far, Maximus, from all that I can perceive, this lady <lb/>
            has no where mentioned the name of magic, but has re­ <lb/>
            counted the very same train of circumstances that I did a short <lb/>
            time since, as to her long widowhood, the cause of her bad <lb/>
            state of health, her wish to marry, my own good qualities, of <lb/>
            which she had heard an account from Pontianus, and his re­ <lb/>
            commendation that she should marry me in preference to any <lb/>
            one else. Thus far has now been read; there remains the other <lb/>
            portion of the letter, which, though written in like manner in my <lb/>
            favour, has been made to turn its horns against me, and which, <lb/>
            while it was sent for the very purpose of removing from me <lb/>
            all suspicion of magical practices, has, to the transcendent <lb/>
            glory of Rufus, changed sides, and gone so far as to gain for <lb/>
            me a quite opposite character in the eyes of certain persons in <lb/>
            Oëa, as though I really were a magician. Much in the inter­ <lb/>
            change of conversation, Maximus, you have heard, still more <lb/>
            in reading you have learned, and no little knowledge by expe­ <lb/>
            rience you have gained; but still, you must declare that <lb/>
            treachery so insidious, and contrived with such astounding <lb/>
            wickedness, you never heard of. What Palamedes, what <lb/>
            Sisyphus, what Eurybates, in fine, what Phrynondas* could <lb/>
            have thought of such a thing ? All those whom I have named, <lb/>
            and any besides who have been famed for their cunning, if <lb/>
            put in comparison with this single device of Rufinus, would <lb/>
            seem to be utter fools and blockheads. 0 wondrous inven­ <lb/>
            tion! 0 subtlety, worthy of the prison and the dungeon <lb/>
            cell! who would have believed that it could come to pass that <lb/>
            what was a defence, could possibly, while the characters still <note type="footnote"> * Phrynondas.]—Eurybates and Phrynondas were persons, probably <lb/>
            magicians, whose, names among the Greeks had become proverbial for <lb/>
            craft and duplicity. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="328"/>
            remained the same, be transformed into an accusation ? By <lb/>
            Hercules! it transcends all belief!</p>
          <p>k But how this thing, which so transcends belief, was brought <lb/>
            about, I will now explain to you. It was the rebuke of a <lb/>
            mother to her son, because, at the dictation of Rufinus, he was <lb/>
            now declaring, that I, a man whom he had so highly extolled <lb/>
            to her, was a magician. The words themselves were to this <lb/>
            effect: [in Greek.] "Apuleius is a magician, and I have <lb/>
            been enchanted by him! I certainly do love him. Come <lb/>
            then to me, until such time as I shall have recovered my <lb/>
            senses." Now these words, which I have read in Greek, <lb/>
            picked out by themselves, and separated from their proper con­ <lb/>
            text, Rufinus showed to everybody, as a confession made by <lb/>
            the lady, at the same time leading Pontianus with him as he <lb/>
            hawked them about the forum.</p>
          <p>He allowed the letter which she wrote to be read, just as <lb/>
            far as I have quoted; what was written before and after he <lb/>
            used to conceal, saying, it was of too disgraceful a nature to be <lb/>
            shewn, and that it was enough to know that the lady had made <lb/>
            confession of magical practices. What could be wanted more ? <lb/>
            It appeared a very probable story to all. The very words that <lb/>
            had been written for the purpose of exculpating me, stirred <lb/>
            up intense hatred against me, among those who did not un­ <lb/>
            derstand the matter. This abominable fellow, raving in the <lb/>
            midst of the forum, like a very bacchanal, collected crowds <lb/>
            together; ever and anon opening the letter, he would appeal <lb/>
            to the citizens, and exclaiming, "Apuleius is a magician, <lb/>
            what she feels and suffers she herself declares; what more would <lb/>
            you have ?" There was no one to take my part, and thus to <lb/>
            answer him, "Have the goodness to give me the whole of the <lb/>
            letter. Allow me to see every part of it, and to read it from <lb/>
            beginning to end. There are many things, which when pro­ <lb/>
            duced in an unconnected form, may seem amenable to accusa­ <lb/>
            tion. Any person's language may afford ground for a charge, <lb/>
            if words which are connected with preceding ones are to be <lb/>
            curtailed of their beginning; if certain parts in the current <lb/>
            order of what has been written are to be suppressed at plea­ <lb/>
            sure ; if what has been asserted ironically, is to be read rather <lb/>
            in the tone of a person who admits, than of one who indig­ <lb/>
            nantly expostulates."</p>
          <p>How justly these and other such remarks might have been <lb/>
             <pb n="329"/>
            made on those occasions, the tenor itself of the letter will show. <lb/>
            Now tell us, Æmilianus, whether you did not, in the presence <lb/>
            of witnesses, copy these words at the same time as myself. <lb/>
            [In Greek.] " For when I was desirous, for the reasons I <lb/>
            mentioned, to marry, you yourself persuaded me to choose him <lb/>
            in preference to all others, because you admired the man, and <lb/>
            greatly wished, through my means, to make him a connection <lb/>
            of ours. But now, when wicked and evil-minded men prompt <lb/>
            you, all on a sudden, Apuleius is a magician, and I have been <lb/>
            enchanted by him. I certainly do love him. Come then to <lb/>
            me, until such time as I shall have recovered my senses." I <lb/>
            ask you, Maximus, if letters, some of which are called vocals <lb/>
            [vowels], could indeed find a voice, if words were winged, <lb/>
            as poets say, would they not, the instant Rufinus, with such <lb/>
            bad faith, made these extracts from this letter, and read <lb/>
            a few words only, while he purposely withheld the greater <lb/>
            and better part,—would not the rest of the letters have <lb/>
            shouted aloud, that they were being wickedly suppressed? <lb/>
            Would not the words so suppressed, have taken flight from <lb/>
            the hands of Rufinus ? Would they not have filled the whole <lb/>
            forum with their outcries ? Would they not have declared <lb/>
            that they, too, were sent by Pudentilla, that they, too, had <lb/>
            a message to speak ? Would they not have said this, in order <lb/>
            that people might not listen to a dishonest and wicked man <lb/>
            attempting to establish a falsehood by means of the letter of <lb/>
            another person, but listen in preference to their own decla­ <lb/>
            ration, that Apuleius was not accused by Pudentilla of the prac­ <lb/>
            tice of magic, but when accused by Rufinus, was acquitted by <lb/>
            her of the fact. All these things, although not then expressed, <lb/>
            are now made clearer than daylight, at a time when they are <lb/>
            of still greater service to me. Your artifices, Rufinus, are ex­ <lb/>
            posed ; your frauds are detected; your falsehoods are set forth <lb/>
            to view. The truth, before suppressed by you, now raises it­ <lb/>
            self erect, and emerges as it were from the deep pit of ca­ <lb/>
            lumny. You challenged me to abide by the letter of Puden­ <lb/>
            tilla ; by that letter do I conquer; and if you choose to hear <lb/>
            the latter portion of it also, I will not prevent it. Read the <lb/>
            words with which this spell-bound, insane, demented, and <lb/>
            love-stricken woman closes her epistle : "I have not been <lb/>
            enchanted at all; that I am in love, is the work of Fate."</p>
          <p>What more than this do you require ? Pudentilla contra- <lb/>
             <pb n="330"/>
            diets you, and, by proclamation as it were, defends her sanity <lb/>
            from your calumnious charges. For the cause or necessity of <lb/>
            her marrying, she ascribes to fate, from whose operations <lb/>
            magic is far removed indeed, nay, utterly estranged. For <lb/>
            what virtue is there left in spells and enchantments, if the <lb/>
            fate of each individual thing, like a torrent of most impetuous <lb/>
            violence, can neither be restrained,, nor yet accelerated in its <lb/>
            course ? Why, in this sentence of hers, Pudentilla has not only <lb/>
            denied that I am a magician, but even that such a thing as <lb/>
            magic exists.</p>
          <p>It is fortunate that Pontianus, according to his usual cus­ <lb/>
            tom, kept his mother's correspondence safe; it is fortunate <lb/>
            that the speedy hearing of this cause has precluded you from <lb/>
            finding leisure to make any alteration in this letter. This ad­ <lb/>
            vantage is owing to you, Maximus, and to your foresight; be­ <lb/>
            cause, seeing from the very first into the calumnious nature of <lb/>
            these charges, you hurried on the hearing of them, in order that <lb/>
            they might not gain strength by lapse of time; and so, by <lb/>
            granting them no respite, you have nipped their growth.</p>
          <p>Suppose, now, that in a letter written in confidence, the mo­ <lb/>
            ther had, as often is the case, made some confession to her son <lb/>
            with reference to love, would it have been right, Rufinus, not <lb/>
            to say duteous or manly even, for the contents of such a letter <lb/>
            to be divulged and published, and that above all, on the infor­ <lb/>
            mation of her son? But I am a simpleton to expect that <lb/>
            you should be observant of the fair name of another, seeing <lb/>
            that you have lost your own. But why do I complain of what <lb/>
            is past, when the present is no less distressing ? That this <lb/>
            boy should be so utterly corrupted by you, as to read aloud <lb/>
            the letters of his own mother, which he takes to be of an <lb/>
            amatory character! and that he should, before the tribunal <lb/>
            of a proconsul, before Claudius Maximus, a man of the strictest <lb/>
            virtue, in presence of these statues of the emperor Pius,* ac­ <lb/>
            cuse his own mother of shameless incontinence! Who is there <lb/>
            so meek as not to be incensed at this? What! make it your <lb/>
            business to pry into your parent's thoughts in such matters; <lb/>
            to watch her eyes; count her sighs; scrutinize her feelings; <lb/>
            intercept her letters; accuse her of amorousness. What! spy <note type="footnote"> * Emperor Pius.]—Antoninus Pius. It was considered criminal and <lb/>
            impious to use any gross expression, or to make any offensive or calum­ <lb/>
            nious charge, in presence of the statue of a Roman emperor. ' </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="331"/>
            out what is done in the retirement of the chamber, not to say <lb/>
            by your own mother when in love, but by any lady whatsoever! <lb/>
            Is it possible you can imagine that she was inspired by any <lb/>
            other than the affectionate feelings of a parent ?</p>
          <p>Alas! unhappy was thy womb, Pudentilla! Oh, barren­ <lb/>
            ness, how far preferable to progeny ! Oh, ten months* pro­ <lb/>
            ductive of what unhappiness! Oh, fourteen years of widow­ <lb/>
            hood thus ill repaid! The viper, I have heard say, eats through <lb/>
            the womb of its mother, and crawls forth to light, and so <lb/>
            owes its birth to parricide. But upon thee, while living, are in­ <lb/>
            flicted wounds still deeper, those, too, by a son who has already <lb/>
            arrived at years of maturity. Thy state of solitude is lacerated, <lb/>
            thy fair name is mangled, thy breast is stabbed, thy inmost <lb/>
            vitals are torn away !</p>
          <p>Is this the way that, like a good son, you make return to <lb/>
            your mother for having given you life—for acquiring an in­ <lb/>
            heritance for you—for providing for your support during four­ <lb/>
            teen long years ? Or has your uncle trained you in a course <lb/>
            like this, in order that you might feel convinced that your <lb/>
            sons would turn out like yourself, and so might not venture <lb/>
            to marry? There is a line of a poet † which is not uncom­ <lb/>
            monly quoted: <lb/>
            "I hate precocious wisdom in young boys." <lb/>
            But, still more, who would not hate and detest precocious <lb/>
            wickedness in a boy ? when he beholds him, like a sort of <lb/>
            monster, full grown up in crime before he is mature in years, <lb/>
            venomous before he is come to his strength, green in boyhood, <lb/>
            in villany hoary, and even more baneful because he is sure of <lb/>
            impunity, and while he is abundantly able to inflict injuries, <lb/>
            he is not liableJ to pains and penalties. Injuries, did I say ? <lb/>
            Nay, crimes rather, and those against a parent; crimes in­ <lb/>
            famous, enormous, astounding! Why, the Athenians, in con­ <lb/>
            sideration of the common rights of humanity, when the inter­ <lb/>
            cepted letters of Philip of Macedon, their enemy, were read in <lb/>
            public, forbade one to be published which had been written by <lb/>
            Philip to his wife, Olympias. They chose rather to spare an <lb/>
            enemy than to divulge the secrets which had been entrusted <note type="footnote"> * Ten months.]—Of gestation. </note><note type="footnote"> t Of a poet.]—It is not known what poet is here referred to. </note><note type="footnote"> t Not liable.]—Not having arrived at man's estate, he was not liable <lb/>

            by a husband to his wife, being of opinion that universal right <lb/>
            ought to be regarded rather than private vengeance.</p>
          <p>Such did enemies shew themselves towards an enemy; what <lb/>
            sort of a son have you shewn yourself towards your mother ? <lb/>
            Do you see how extremely similar are the cases I compare ? <lb/>
            And yet you, a son, read letters written by your own mother, <lb/>
            on amorous subjects, as you allege, in the presence of this <lb/>
            numerous assemblage, before whom, if you had been requested <lb/>
            to read some wanton poet, you assuredly would not have ven­ <lb/>
            tured to do so, but would have been prevented by some sense <lb/>
            of shame; indeed, if you had ever touched upon letters in <lb/>
            general, you would never have touched letters* written by <lb/>
            your own mother. But what an epistle of your own was it <lb/>
            that you ventured to give to be read ! the letter which, most <lb/>
            disrespectfully, most insultingly, and most basely, you wrote <lb/>
            about your mother, and secretly sent to Pontianus, at the very <lb/>
            time that you were still nurtured in her bosom! in order, I <lb/>
            suppose, that you might not have sinned once only, and that <lb/>
            such reputable conduct as yours might not be buried in obli­ <lb/>
            vion. Wretched youth ! you do not perceive that your uncle <lb/>
            allowed this to be done, in order that he might exculpate him­ <lb/>
            self in the sight of men, when it should become known from <lb/>
            your own letter, that even before you betook yourself to him, <lb/>
            even when you were still fawning upon your mother, even <lb/>
            then you were acting a fox-like and unnatural part. Besides, <lb/>
            I cannot bring myself to believe that Æmilianus is so simple <lb/>
            as to suppose that the letter of a: boy, and that boy my ac­ <lb/>
            cuser, could do me any injury.</p>
          <p>Then, there was that counterfeit letter, which was neither <lb/>
            written by my hand, nor even forged with any likelihood, by <lb/>
            which they wished to make it appear that this lady had been <lb/>
            plied by me with blandishments. Why should I need to re­ <lb/>
            sort to blandishments, if I relied on my magical powers ? <lb/>
            Besides, by what means, too, was a letter to come into their <lb/>
            hands, which was, no doubt, sent to Pudentilla by the hands of <lb/>
            some trusty messenger, as usual in matters of this nature ? And <lb/>
            why should I write in expressions so ungrammatical, in lan­ <lb/>
            guage so barbarous, when they assert that I am far from unac­ <lb/>
            quainted with the Greek language ? Why, too, should I solicit <note type="footnote"> * Touched letters.]—This pun exists in the original. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="333"/>
            her with compliments so absurd, so pot-house like,* when they <lb/>
            say that I am able to express myself elegantly in the wanton <lb/>
            numbers of amatory verse ? The truth, no doubt, is this; to <lb/>
            every one it is self-evident :-he who was not able to read the <lb/>
            letter of Pudentilla, because it was expressed in purer Greek, <lb/>
            could read this more easily, and find himself more at home in <lb/>
            descanting upon it, because the composition was his own.</p>
          <p>But now, I shall consider that I have said sufficient on the <lb/>
            subject of these letters, when I shall have added this single <lb/>
            fact, that Pudentilla, after having written by way of irony and <lb/>
            joke, " Come until such time as I shall have come to my <lb/>
            senses," after the date of that very letter invited to her house <lb/>
            her sons and her daughter-in-law, and lived there with them <lb/>
            for a period of nearly two months. Let this dutiful son de­ <lb/>
            clare what, during that period, he saw his mother either do or <lb/>
            say that was unbecoming, in consequence of this insanity of <lb/>
            hers. Let him deny that she did,. in the most intelligent <lb/>
            manner, audit and sign the accounts of the bailiffs, and the shep­ <lb/>
            herds, and the grooms ; let him deny that his brother Ponti­ <lb/>
            anus was seriously warned by her to be on his guard against <lb/>
            the insidious designs of Rufinus; let him deny that he was <lb/>
            justly censured for having everywhere carried about the letter <lb/>
            which she had written to him, and yet not having read it <lb/>
            faithfully; let him deny that, after all this, his mother was <lb/>
            married to me at her country-house, the place previously agreed <lb/>
            on between us.</p>
          <p>For we had thought it better for us to be united at her <lb/>
            country-house in the suburbs, in order that the people of the <lb/>
            city might not again flock to us for largesses; as it was not <lb/>
            very long since Pudentilla had expended fifty thousand pieces <lb/>
            of money, her own property, upon the public, on the day on <lb/>
            which Pontianus was married, and this boy was invested with <lb/>
            the manly gown. Another reason, was our wish to escape nume­ <lb/>
            rous invitations and annoyances which newly-married people <lb/>
            generally have to submit to. ' Here, JEmilianus, you have the <lb/>
            entire cause why the marriage contract between me and Puden­ <lb/>
            tilla was signed, not in town, but at the country-house, that <lb/>
            she might not have again to expend fifty thousand pieces of <lb/>
            money, and that we might not be obliged to feast in your com­ <lb/>
            pany, or at your house. <note type="footnote"> * Sopot-house like.]—' Tamque tabernariis </note> <pb n="334"/>
            </p>
          <p>Was not the cause, then, a reasonable one ? Still I am sur. <lb/>
            prised that you, who generally live in the country, have such <lb/>
            a remarkable aversion to a country-house. The Julian law, at <lb/>
            all events, in its ordinances for the regulation of marriages, no­ <lb/>
            where contains any prohibition to this effect—" Marry not a <lb/>
            wife at a country-house." Nay, to say the truth, a wife is <lb/>
            married under much better auspices, so far as relates to pro­ <lb/>
            geny, at a country-house, than in a town-upon a fruitful soil, <lb/>
            than in a sterile spot--upon the glebe of the field, than upon <lb/>
            the stones of the Forum. She who is destined to be a mother, <lb/>
            ought to enter upon the marriage state in the very bosom of <lb/>
            her mother, among the ripening ears of corn, and upon the <lb/>
            fertile sod; or else she should recline beneath the wedded <lb/>
            elm, on the lap of her mother earth, amid the offspring of the <lb/>
            grass, the progeny of the vines, and the offshoots of the trees. <lb/>
            Closely in accordance with this is that line,* so frequently <lb/>
            quoted in the comic writers- <lb/>
            " Children in fields are lawfully begot."</p>
          <p>To the Romans of ancient times, the Quintii, † the Serrani, <lb/>
            and many others like them, not only wives, but consulships <lb/>
            even, and dictatorships, were presented in the country. I <lb/>
            will check, myself, however, in a field of such ample range, <lb/>
            that I may not gratify you [a rustic] by lavishing praises upon <lb/>
            a country-house.</p>
          <p>And now, as to the age of Pudentilla, about which, after these <lb/>
            other matters, you uttered falsehoods with such great assurance, <lb/>
            as even to assert that she was sixty years of age when she mar­ <lb/>
            ried, I will say a few words; for, on a matter so self evident, it <lb/>
            is not necessary to descant at any great length. Her father, at <lb/>
            her birth, made the usual declaration, that she was his daughter. <lb/>
            Her register is preserved, one part in the public registry, the <lb/>
            counterpart at home, and the latter is now presented before <lb/>
            your face. Hand that register to Æmilianus. Let him see <lb/>
            the fastenings, J examine the impression of the seal, read the <lb/>
            names of the consuls, and count the years. Of the sixty years <note type="footnote"> * That line.]—The author of this line is now unknown. </note><note type="footnote"> t The Quintii.]—In allusion to Q. Cincinnatus. See Livy, Book iii. <lb/>

            that he gave to this lady, let him prove as much as five and <lb/>
            fifty. By a whole lustrum* has he deviated from the truth. <lb/>
            But that is not enough: I will deal with him still more libe­ <lb/>
            rally. For he has made a present of a great number of years <lb/>
            to Pudentilla; I shall, therefore, have to give them back to <lb/>
            him by way of return. Like Ulysses, Mezentius † has gone <lb/>
            astray ten whole years; let him prove, at least, that this lady <lb/>
            is fifty years of age. But why use many words ? To deal <lb/>
            with him as I would with a four-fold informer, J I will double <lb/>
            the five years twice over, and at once strike off twenty. <lb/>
            Order the consuls to be reckoned, Maximus: if I am not mis­ <lb/>
            taken, you will find that Pudentilla is not now much beyond <lb/>
            her fortieth year. Oh, audacious and outrageous lie, that <lb/>
            ought to be visited with an exile of twenty years! Do you <lb/>
            dare, Æmilianus, to amplify your lies, by thus adding to them <lb/>
            one half as much again ? If it had been thirty years§ that <lb/>
            you stated instead of ten, you might possibly have appeared to <lb/>
            have made a mistake in the position of your fingers in count­ <lb/>
            ing, and, where you ought to have contracted the fingers in a <lb/>
            circle,|| to have opened them too wide. ¶ But when the num­ <lb/>
            ber forty, which is denoted more easily than any of the others, <lb/>
            by opening out the palm of the hand, when this number forty <lb/>
            you increase by half as much again, you can have made no <lb/>
            such mistake in the position of your fingers; unless, perhaps, <lb/>
            you took the years of Pudentilla to be thirty, and accidentally <lb/>
            added together the two consuls for each year. <note type="footnote"> * Whole lustrum.]-A period of five years, or, more properly, four years <lb/>

            </p>
          <p>All these matters I pass by: I now come to the very root of <lb/>
            this accusation, to the very cause of the alleged magic. Let <lb/>
            .Emilianus and Rufinus make answer for what profit, even if <lb/>
            I had been the greatest of magicians, I should by charms and <lb/>
            ' by drugs have enticed Pudentilla to marry me. And yet I am <lb/>
            Well aware, that many a person has been accused of a crime <lb/>
            where certain motives for the commission of it could be proved <lb/>
            to exist, and still, has most successfully defended himself by <lb/>
            shewing that his whole course of life has been utterly averse <lb/>
            to misdeeds of such a nature; and that it ought not to prove <lb/>
            to his detriment if there seemed to exist some inducements <lb/>
            for the perpetration of the crime. For not every thing which <lb/>
            possibly may have happened, ought to be considered'as really <lb/>
            having happened. There are various fluctuations in human <lb/>
            affairs ; but the disposition of each person affords a sure evi­ <lb/>
            dence, for, as it is always affected with the same tendency to­ <lb/>
            wards virtue or towards vice, it affords an unerring proof of the <lb/>
            readiness to embrace criminality or to reject it.</p>
          <p>Although I might, with the greatest justice, make use of <lb/>
            these arguments, still, I spare you them; nor do I deem it <lb/>
            enough to have abundantly proved my innocence on all the <lb/>
            points on which you accuse me, and to have never allowed <lb/>
            the slightest suspicion even of the practice of magic to attach <lb/>
            to me. Only consider what a degree of confidence in my own <lb/>
            innocence I display, and what supreme contempt of you [my <lb/>
            accusers], when I say that if even the slightest ground shall <lb/>
            appear why I should have coveted this match with Pudentilla <lb/>
            for the sake of any advantage to myself, if you shall prove the <lb/>
            most trifling gain to me thereby, then may I be held to be a <lb/>
            Phrynondas, a Damigeron,* a Moses, a Jannes, an Apollonius, <lb/>
            or even Dardanus himself, or any one else, who, since the <note type="footnote"> * Damigeron.]-He is mentioned by Tertullian as a famous magician : <lb/>
            Dardanus was also celebrated for his skill in the same art. Phrynondas, <lb/>
            Apollonius of Tyana, Zoroaster, and Ostanes have been previously al­ <lb/>
            luded to. Moses, the law-giver of the Hebrews, was universally looked <lb/>
            upon among the heathens as a magician, and is mentioned as such by <lb/>
            Strabo, Pliny, and. Tacitus. Jannes, and his brother Jambres, are sup­ <lb/>
            posed to have been two of the chief magicians who opposed Moses in the <lb/>
            court of Pharaoh. They are also mentioned in the Second Epistle to <lb/>
            Timothy, iii. 8. Jannes is also mentioned, together with Moses, by <lb/>
            Pliny, and he and Jambres are spoken of by Numenius and Palladius as <lb/>
            most skilful magicians.. </note> <lb/>

          <p>Do see, Maximus, I beg of you, what an uproar they raise, <lb/>
            merely because I have enumerated a few of the magicians <lb/>
            by name. What am I to do with men so ignorant, so barbar­ <lb/>
            ous ? Am I to tell them over again, that these and very many <lb/>
            other names I have read in public libraries, in the works of <lb/>
            authors of the highest reputation ? Or am I to discuss the <lb/>
            point, that it is one thing to be acquainted with their names, <lb/>
            but quite another to have been initiated into the art itself, and <lb/>
            that the appliances of learning, and the recollections of erudi­ <lb/>
            tion, are not to be held to be a confession of criminality ? Or <lb/>
            shall I do better, and rely, Claudius Maximus, on your learn­ <lb/>
            ing, and extensive information, and not think it worth my <lb/>
            while to make answer on these matters to foolish and illiterate <lb/>
            men ? I will adopt that course. What they may think of it, <lb/>
            I care not a nutshell. I will proceed to prove what I stated: <lb/>
            that I had no reason whatever for using incantations to induce <lb/>
            Pudentilla to form an alliance with me.</p>
          <p>They took it upon themselves to disparage the looks and the <lb/>
            age of this lady, and then they imputed it to me as a crime, <lb/>
            that I desired to gain such a wife, in order to satisfy my <lb/>
            avarice, and that for that reason, at the very earliest moment <lb/>
            after our union, I wrested from her a large and ample fortune. <lb/>
            It is not my intention to fatigue you, Maximus, by a lengthened <lb/>
            speech in reply to this. There is no need of words, when the <lb/>
            documents themselves speak so much more eloquently; docu­ <lb/>
            ments by which you will find that I have acted throughout, <lb/>
            both as regarded present arrangements, and provisions for the <lb/>
            future, in a manner quite at variance with what they sur­ <lb/>
            mised of me, in conformity with their own rapacious dispo­ <lb/>
            sitions. In the first place, then, the amount put in settle- . <lb/>
            ment by this lady of such vast wealth, you will find to have <lb/>
            been but small, and that amount not a sum paid down, but <lb/>
            only secured in remainder. Besides this, you will find that <lb/>
            the union took place upon these terms; in case ahe should <lb/>
            depart this life without issue by me, the entire sum so settled <lb/>
            was to go to her sons, Pontianus and Pudens; but, if she should <lb/>
            die, leaving one such son or one daughter surviving her, then, <lb/>
            in such case, one half of the sum was to go to the last born <lb/>
            son, and the residue to the older ones. This, I say, I will <note type="footnote"> z </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="338"/>
            prove, from the instrument itself. It may possibly happen, <lb/>
            that not even then, .,Emilianus will believe that only three <lb/>
            hundred thousand pieces of money were so settled, and that by <lb/>
            arrangement they were to go in reversion to the sons of Pu­ <lb/>
            dentilla.</p>
          <p>Take this document in your own hands, [Æmilianus], and <lb/>
            give it to your prompter, Rufinus, for him to read. Let him <lb/>
            be ashamed of his swelling aspirations, and his ambitious <lb/>
            mendicity; for he himself, though in utter want, and stripped <lb/>
            naked, gave, as a marriage portion to his daughter, four hun­ <lb/>
            dred thousand pieces of money taken from a creditor; Pu­ <lb/>
            dentilla, on the other hand, a wealthy woman, has contented <lb/>
            herself with a settlement of three hundred thousand pieces, <lb/>
            and has a husband, too, who, after having many a time re­ <lb/>
            jected settlements of ample sums, rests contented with the <lb/>
            empty name of such a trifling sum as this, for he reckons all <lb/>
            other things, except his wife, as nothing at all, and centres <lb/>
            all his possessions and all his wealth in the concord of the <lb/>
            marriage state, and in mutual attachment.</p>
          <p>And yet, who, of all men that had the slightest knowledge <lb/>
            even of the world, would have presumed to censure her, if a <lb/>
            woman, who was a widow and of average good looks, but be­ <lb/>
            yond mid age, being desirous to marry, had by offering an <lb/>
            ample settlement and handsome terms, held out a temptation <lb/>
            to a young man who was by no means to be despised either for <lb/>
            his looks, his intellect, or his fortune ? A beauteous virgin, <lb/>
            even though she may chance to be utterly destitute, is still <lb/>
            provided with an ample marriage portion ; for she brings to <lb/>
            her new husband the winning nature of her disposition, the <lb/>
            charms of her beauty, the first fruits of her maidenhood. The <lb/>
            very recommendation itself of virginity is rightly and de­ <lb/>
            servedly most highly esteemed by all husbands. For whatever <lb/>
            else you gain by way of portion, you may, whenever you <lb/>
            please, return the whole of it, so as to remain under no obli­ <lb/>
            gation whatever. Money you may repay in full, slaves you <lb/>
            may restore, a house you may quit, an estate you may leave. <lb/>
            Virginity alone, when once it has been bestowed, can never be <lb/>
            returned; of the things that form a marriage portion, that alone <lb/>
            must of necessity remain with the husband.</p>
          <p>A widow, on the other hand, on a divorce taking place, de­ <lb/>
            parts just as she came on marriage ; nothing does she bring <lb/>
             <pb n="339"/>
            that she may not reclaim; but she comes to you deflowered by <lb/>
            another; to say the least, very far from being an apt scholar in <lb/>
            carrying out your wishes; holding her new abode in no less sus­ <lb/>
            picion than that in which, by reason of her separation from her <lb/>
            former husband, she herself deserves to be held; whether it is <lb/>
            that she has lost that husband by death, in which case, as being <lb/>
            a woman of unlucky omen, and unfortunate in wedlock, she <lb/>
            ought to be avoided ; or whether it is, that she has been sepa­ <lb/>
            rated from him by divorce, in which latter case a woman must <lb/>
            have one or the other of these two faults; she must have been <lb/>
            either so unbearable as to have been repudiated, or else so fro­ <lb/>
            ward as to have divorced herself. For these and other reasons <lb/>
            it is, that widows generally invite suitors by more ample set­ <lb/>
            tlements ; a thing that Pudentilla, even, might have done in <lb/>
            the case of another husband, if she had not met with a philo­ <lb/>
            sopher who held all settlements in contempt.</p>
          <p>Well, now, if I had desired to gain this lady in order to <lb/>
            satisfy my avarice, what plan would there have been more <lb/>
            feasible by which to gain possession of her house, than to sow <lb/>
            discord between the mother and her sons ? to erase from her <lb/>
            feelings all affection for her children, in order that I might the <lb/>
            more freely and the more certainly, on being left without <lb/>
            rivals, gain full possession of the desolate woman ? Was not <lb/>
            this the part of a robber such as you pretend that I am ? and <lb/>
            yet I, the author, promoter, and supporter of peace, and con­ <lb/>
            cord, and affection, not only did not sow new dissensions, but <lb/>
            even utterly eradicated those which previously existed. I <lb/>
            prompted my wife, the whole of whose property they assert I <lb/>
            had already made away with, I prompted her, I say, and at last <lb/>
            succeeded in persuading her, on her sons demanding repayment <lb/>
            of their money, as I have already mentioned, to repay them <lb/>
            without delay, and that in lands valued at a low figure, and at <lb/>
            whatever price they themselves pleased. Besides this, out of <lb/>
            her own private-property, I persuaded her to give them some <lb/>
            of the most fertile of her farms, a fine house, too, fitted up in a <lb/>
            most costly manner, with a great quantity of wheat, barley, <lb/>
            wine, oil, and other products of the soil; slaves, too, no less <lb/>
            than four hundred in number, and cattle not a few, and of no <lb/>
            small value; and all this, that she might set them at ease as <lb/>
            to that portion of her property which she thus gave them, and <lb/>
            encourage them to be of good hopes as to the remainder. All <note type="footnote"> z 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="340"/>
            this I obtained with great difficulty, and by urgent entreaties, <lb/>
            from the angry and reluctant Pudentilla—for as such was the <lb/>
            fact, she will not obj ect to my saying so. I reconciled the mother <lb/>
            to her sons; I enriched my step-sons, (who in this first expe­ <lb/>
            rienced the benefit of having a step-father,) with a large sum of <lb/>
            money. Throughout the whole city this fact was well known. <lb/>
            All vented execrations against Rufinus, and lavished commend­ <lb/>
            ations upon me. Pontianus came to us, together with this bro­ <lb/>
            ther of his, so unlike him in disposition, before his mother <lb/>
            would consent to make this gift; and, throwing himself at our <lb/>
            feet, asked us to forget and forgive all that had passed, weeping <lb/>
            and kissing our hands, and saying how much he repented that <lb/>
            he had listened to Rufinus and those like him.</p>
          <p>After that, he suppliantly entreated me to excuse him to <lb/>
            Lollianus Avitus,* that most illustrious man, to whom, shortly <lb/>
            before, he had been recommended by me at the outset of his <lb/>
            professional career; t for he had become aware that a few days <lb/>
            previously I had written and informed A vitus of every thing <lb/>
            that had taken place. This, too, he prevailed upon me to do. <lb/>
            Accordingly, furnished with a letter by me, he set out for <lb/>
            Carthage, where, Maximus, the period of his proconsulship <lb/>
            being now nearly expired, Lollianus A vitus was awaiting your <lb/>
            arrival. After reading my letter, in conformity with his usual <lb/>
            extreme kindness of disposition, he commended Pontianus for <lb/>
            having so readily made amends for his error, and wrote back <lb/>
            to me, by him, good Gods! what a letter! what a style, what <lb/>
            wit, what grace and sweetness of expression! He wrote, in <lb/>
            fact, just as a good man, and one skilled in the arts of elo­ <lb/>
            quence, ought to write. I am sure, Maximus, that you will <lb/>
            hear his letter with pleasure; and if I do read it, it shall be <lb/>
            with my own lips. Hand me the letter of A vitus, that so, <lb/>
            what has ever been an ornament to me, may now prove my <lb/>
            safety too. You, in the meantime, may suffer the water [of the <lb/>
            Clepsydra] to run on; for were I to read over the letter of <lb/>
            that most excellent man three or four times, I would not <lb/>
            think it lost time. [He reads the letter of Lollianus Avitus, <lb/>
            which is now lost. ]</p>
          <p>I am not unaware that I ought, after that letter of A vitus, <lb/>
            to come to a close. For whom can I produce to speak more <note type="footnote"> * Lollianus Avitus.]—The proconsul of Africa before Claudius Maximus. </note><note type="footnote"> t Professional career]—That of a pleader or advocate. </note> <lb/>

            abundantly in my commendation ? what witness to my charac <lb/>
            ter more worthy of all confidence ? what more eloquent advo <lb/>
            cate ? Many eloquent men who bore the Roman name have I <lb/>
            known and studied during my life, but never did I admire any <lb/>
            one so much as him. There is not an individual at this day, <lb/>
            in my opinion, of any name, of any promise in the arts of elo­ <lb/>
            quence, but would greatly prefer to be Avitus, if, all envy <lb/>
            laid aside, he would think proper to institute a comparison be­ <lb/>
            tween Avitus and himself. For in this one man are united <lb/>
            all the various gifts of eloquence, even those that are almost <lb/>
            opposite in their nature. Whatever the speech Avitus may <lb/>
            compose, so perfect and finished will it be in all its parts, that <lb/>
            in it Cato would not fail to find his own gravity, Lælius his <lb/>
            smoothness, Gracchus his vehemence, Caesar his vigorous <lb/>
            subtlety, Hortensius his perspicuity, Calms his wit, Sallust his <lb/>
            terseness, nor Cicero his richness of expression ; once, for all, <lb/>
            I say, not to review each particular, if you were to hear Avitus, <lb/>
            you would wish nothing added, nothing withdrawn, nothing <lb/>
            changed. I see, Maximus, with what pleasure you hear those <lb/>
            characteristics described, which you recognize as distinguishing <lb/>
            your friend Avitus. It is your kindness that has induced me <lb/>
            to say even this little of him. But I will not so far indulge <lb/>
            your sympathy as to allow myself, nearly exhausted as I now <lb/>
            am, and my defence drawing to its close, to begin at this late <lb/>
            hour to descant on his exemplary virtues; but I will, in pre­ <lb/>
            ference, reserve these topics for my recruited strength and a <lb/>
            leisure opportunity.</p>
          <p>For now, to my disgust, my discourse must be turned from <lb/>
            the praises of a man of such eminent worth, to these pestilent <lb/>
            wretches. And would you dare then, Æmilianus, to set your­ <lb/>
            self in comparison with Avitus ? Him whom he pronounces to <lb/>
            be a good man; him whose manner of life Avitus so abundantly <lb/>
            commends in his letter, will you pursue with your charges of <lb/>
            magic and criminality ? Is it for you to be more annoyed at <lb/>
            my thrusting myself into the house of Pudentilla and plunder- , <lb/>
            ing her of her property, than was Pontianus, who, even in <lb/>
            my absence, made full amends to me before Avitus, for the en­ <lb/>
            mity of a few days into which he had been led by your insti­ <lb/>
            gation ; and who expressed his gratitude to me in presence of a <lb/>
            man of such eminence ?</p>
          <p>Suppose, now, I had stated what took place before Avitus, <lb/>
             <pb n="342"/>
            but had not read his letter, what would you, or what would <lb/>
            any one, have found to censure in this matter ? Pontianus <lb/>
            himself declared that it was by my bounty he had received <lb/>
            what had been presented to him by his mother; from his in­ <lb/>
            most heart Pontianus congratulated himself that it had fallen <lb/>
            to his lot to have me for a step-father, and would that he had <lb/>
            returned in safety from Carthage! or, since it was thus decreed <lb/>
            by Fate, would that you, Rufinus, had not obstructed the <lb/>
            carrying out of his latest intentions! What grateful thanks <lb/>
            would he have expressed to me, either personally or in his <lb/>
            last will! Still the letters which he sent to me from Carthage, <lb/>
            as well as while on the road home-those written while in <lb/>
            robust health, the others when reduced by sickness, but both' <lb/>
            replete with commendations of me, both filled with expressions <lb/>
            of affection—these, Maximus, I beg you will allow, for a mo­ <lb/>
            ment, to be read, in order that his brother, my accuser, may <lb/>
            know how different in every respect is the career which he is <lb/>
            running from that of his brother, a man of most blessed me­ <lb/>
            mory. [The letters of Pontianus are read.]</p>
          <p>Did you hear the epithets which your brother, Pontianus, <lb/>
            bestowed on me; how, both repeatedly on other occasions, <lb/>
            as also at his latest moments, he called me his parent, his <lb/>
            master, his instructor? I could also produce letters of yours <lb/>
            to the like effect, if I thought it worth while to waste a mo­ <lb/>
            ment upon them. I would prefer, rather, that your brother's <lb/>
            last will, unfinished as it is, should be produced, in which he <lb/>
            makes most affectionate and most honorable mention of me. <lb/>
            That will, however, Rufinus would not allow to be seen, nor <lb/>
            even to be completed, through his vexation at losing the pro­ <lb/>
            perty ; a property which he had valued at the large price of the <lb/>
            nights of a few months during which he was the father-in-law <lb/>
            of Pontianus. Besides this, he had consulted some Chaldæan <lb/>
            astrologers or others, in what way he might dispose of his <lb/>
            daughter with profit to himself. They, as I hear, and I only <lb/>
            wish that they had not in this given a true answer, replied that <lb/>
            her first husband would die in the course of a few months. But <lb/>
            the rest of their answer, as to his property, they framed, as is <lb/>
            generally the case, just in conformity with the wishes of the <lb/>
            person who consulted them. However, the Gods so willed it, <lb/>
            that just like some blind beast, he opened wide his jaws, but <lb/>
            got nothing at all. For Pontianus, on detecting her guilt, <lb/>
             <pb n="343"/>
            ,not only did not make the daughter of Rufinus his heir, but <lb/>
            did not so much as leave her a decent legacy; but ordered <lb/>
            that, as a mark of disgrace, linen cloth,* of about two hundred <lb/>
            denars in value, should be presented to her, in order that it <lb/>
            might be understood that he had disinherited her, prompted <lb/>
            by a feeling of indignation, and had not omitted her through <lb/>
            forgetfulness.</p>
          <p>For in this will, as well as in a former one which was read, <lb/>
            he made his mother and his brother his heirs; the latter of <lb/>
            whom, though'still a mere boy, as you see, Rufinus is plying <lb/>
            with this same daughter of his, as his engine of attack, throw­ <lb/>
            ing her in his way, and thrusting upon this wretched youth a <lb/>
            woman greatly his senior in age, and but recently the wife of <lb/>
            his own brother. As for him, being captivated and enthralled <lb/>
            by the allurements of the harlot of a daughter and the wiles of <lb/>
            the pimp of a father, the moment that his brother breathed his <lb/>
            last, he left his mother, and betook himself to his uncle, in order <lb/>
            that, being at a distance from us, his designs might be the better <lb/>
            put into execution. For Rufinus is a favourite with Æmili­ <lb/>
            anus, who wishes him success in his plans. Good! it is well <lb/>
            that you have reminded me ;† his own expectations, too, this <lb/>
            worthy uncle, cherishes and promotes, by adopting this course, <lb/>
            as he well knows that he is more likely ‡ to be the legal heir <lb/>
            of the boy if he dies intestate, than his appointed heir under a <lb/>
            will. By Hercules! I should have been sorry if that notion <lb/>
            had originated with me. It is not in accordance with my <lb/>
            moderation openly to give vent to what are the secret suspi­ <lb/>
            cions of all: it was wrong on your part to suggest it.</p>
          <p>At all events, AEmilianus, if you would have the truth, <lb/>
            many persons are surprised at this affection of yours for this <lb/>
            boy, which has so suddenly sprung up since the death of his <lb/>
            brother Pontianus; whereas, before that, you were so much <lb/>
            a stranger to him, that, many a time when you met him, you <note type="footnote"> * Linen cloth.]—Isidorus, in his ' Origines,' informs us that linen gar­ <lb/>

            did not know by face the son of your own brother. Now, <lb/>
            however, you show yourself so considerate of him, so spoil him <lb/>
            by indulgence, are so careful not to thwart him in anything, <lb/>
            as, by this course, to produce a confirmation of such suspicions. <lb/>
            You received him from us a stripling; you instantly invested <lb/>
            him with the privileges of puberty. As long as he was under <lb/>
            our management, he was in the habit of attending masters ; <lb/>
            now, taking a wide flight from them, he makes for the brothel; <lb/>
            his friends of steady demeanour he shuns, while, at his tender <lb/>
            age, this young boy passes his life with young men of the <lb/>
            most abandoned character, amid courtesans and cups. It is he <lb/>
            who is the ruler in your house, it is he who is the head of your <lb/>
            family, it is he who is the master of your banquets. At the <lb/>
            gladiatorial exhibitions, too, he is a constant attendant, and, <lb/>
            like a lad of gentility, he is instructed by his fencing-master <lb/>
            in the names of the gladiators, their combats, and their <lb/>
            wounds.</p>
          <p>He never speaks but in the Punic tongue, or any little <lb/>
            smattering of Greek he may still retain, after learning it from <lb/>
            his mother. But in Latin he has neither the will nor the <lb/>
            inclination to speak. You heard, Maximus, a short time ago, <lb/>
            my step-son, the brother of Pontianus, a young man who was <lb/>
            distinguished for his eloquence-shame and disgrace to him!— <lb/>
            stammering out with the greatest difficulty a few syllables, at <lb/>
            the time when you enquired of him whether his mother had <lb/>
            presented to them the property which I asserted she had at <lb/>
            my prompting so presented. I therefore call you to witness, <lb/>
            Claudius Maximus, and you who are sitting here in judgment, <lb/>
            and you also who aid me with your presence on this my <lb/>
            trial, that these corruptions, and scandals in his life, ought <lb/>
            to be attributed to his uncle here, and to this candidate for <lb/>
            the honor of being his father-in-law; and I protest that I shall, <lb/>
            from this time forward, congratulate myself that such a step- <lb/>
            son as this has shaken off from his neck the yoke of my <lb/>
            guardianship, and shall no more think of entreating his mother <lb/>
            in his behalf.</p>
          <p>For,—I had all but forgotten to mention it-very recently, <lb/>
            and since the death of her son Pontianus, Pudentilla, being then <lb/>
            in bad health, was making her will, on which I had a struggle <lb/>
            with her of considerable duration in order to prevent her from <lb/>
            disinheriting him, in return for insults so glaring, for injuries <lb/>
             <pb n="345"/>
            so numerous. With earnest entreaties I begged her to strike <lb/>
            out [of the will] a most severe character of him, the whole of <lb/>
            which, I solemnly declare, she had already written. In fine, <lb/>
            I threatened to separate from her, if I did not prevail in my <lb/>
            request. I entreated her to grant me this favour, to conquer <lb/>
            her wicked son by kindness, and so release me from all chance <lb/>
            of incurring hatred. Nor did I cease until she had complied <lb/>
            with my request.</p>
          <p>I am vexed that I have thus removed this ground of anxiety <lb/>
            from Æmilianus, that I have pointed out to him a path so <lb/>
            entirely unexpected. Do look, I beg of you, Maximus, how, <lb/>
            on hearing this, he has suddenly become quite bewildered, how <lb/>
            he has riveted his eyes upon the ground. For he had fancied, <lb/>
            and not without reason, that the fact was far otherwise. He <lb/>
            knew that this lady was offended at the insults offered by her <lb/>
            son, and was strongly influenced by my attentions to her. As <lb/>
            regarded me, too, he had good grounds for apprehension. For <lb/>
            any person, even though he had been as much a despiser of <lb/>
            wealth as I am, might still not have declined to take his re­ <lb/>
            venge on a step-son who had shown himself so undutiful. It was <lb/>
            this anxiety, above all, that urged them to bring this accusa­ <lb/>
            tion against me. Arguing from a knowledge of their own <lb/>
            avarice, they have wrongly conjectured that the whole of her <lb/>
            property has been left to me. As regards the past time, I will <lb/>
            release you from that fear; for neither the opportunity of gain­ <lb/>
            ing property, nor yet revenge, were able to shake my mind in <lb/>
            the position which it had taken. I, the step-father, struggled <lb/>
            with his offended mother in behalf of a wicked step-son, just <lb/>
            as though I had been a father striving with a step-mother <lb/>
            in favour of his best of sons; nor was I content unless I <lb/>
            checked, far more than I ought to have done, the abundant <lb/>
            generosity of an affectionate wife, which was ready to be shown <lb/>
            in my own favour.</p>
          <p>Hand me the will which has been made by the mother <lb/>
            since her son has been at enmity with her, and of which <lb/>
            I, whom these people call a robber, prefaced each word with <lb/>
            my entreaties. Order, Maximus, that document to be opened; <lb/>
            you will find her son named as her heir, while to myself, as a <lb/>
            mark of regard, there is left some trifling legacy or other; in <lb/>
            order that, if anything should happen to her, I, the husband, <lb/>
            might not find my name altogether omitted in the will of my <lb/>
             <pb n="346"/>
            own wife. Take that will, written by your mother, a will <lb/>
            which is truly forgetful of the ties of duty. For why ? In it <lb/>
            she has disinherited a most attentive husband, while she has <lb/>
            named as her heir a most vindictive son, or rather, I may say, <lb/>
            not her son, but the hopes of Æmilianus, and the match de­ <lb/>
            signed by Rufinus, as well as that besotted crew, your para­ <lb/>
            sites.</p>
          <p>Take it, I say, best of sons, and lay aside for a moment the <lb/>
            amatory epistles of your mother, and read her will in prefer­ <lb/>
            ence. If she has written anything when labouring under a <lb/>
            kind of insanity, as it were, here you will find it, ay, and from <lb/>
            the very beginning-" Let SiciniusPudens, my son, be my heir." <lb/>
            He who reads that, I admit, will take her to be insane. " Is <lb/>
            this son [he will say] appointed your heir, who, on the occa­ <lb/>
            sion of the very funeral of his brother, having called together <lb/>
            a band of most abandoned youths, attempted to exclude you <lb/>
            from the house which you yourself had presented to him ? A <lb/>
            youth who was vexed and annoyed that you had been left by <lb/>
            his brother joint-heir with himself? Who, amid your sorrow <lb/>
            and mourning, instantly abandoned you, and fled from your <lb/>
            bosom to Rufinus and Æmilianus ? Who afterwards, before <lb/>
            your very face, gave utterance to numerous insults, and, with <lb/>
            the assistance of his uncle, was guilty of perpetrating others ? <lb/>
            Who bandied your name about before tribunals ? Who at­ <lb/>
            tempted publicly to cast a stain upon your fair name, by pro­ <lb/>
            ducing your own letters against you ? Who brought a capital <lb/>
            charge against the husband of whom you had made choice, a <lb/>
            husband whom, as he himself objected against you, you loved <lb/>
            to distraction?" Open, worthy youth, open the will, I beg; <lb/>
            by so doing you will the more easily prove your mother's in­ <lb/>
            sanity. Why do you decline ? Why refuse ?-that, too, <lb/>
            after you have had all anxiety removed as to the inheritance <lb/>
            of your mother's property. I will, however, Maximus, place <lb/>
            this document here, in this spot, before your feet, and I protest <lb/>
            that, from henceforth, I shall take much less interest in what <lb/>
            it is Pudentilla inserts in her will. Let him, from this <lb/>
            time forward, entreat his mother, as he pleases; to me he. <lb/>
            has left no grounds for supplicating any more in his behalf. <lb/>
            Henceforth let him, as he is his own master, and addresses <lb/>
            most virulent letters to his mother, take upon himself to assuage <lb/>
            her wrath. He who could undertake a prosecution, will be <lb/>
            able to plead his own cause.</p><pb n="347"/>
            
          <p>It is quite enough for me, if I have not only most abun­ <lb/>
            dantly disproved the crimes laid to my charge, but have even <lb/>
            utterly uprooted the grounds for bringing me to trial—I mean <lb/>
            the envy on account of the property supposed to have been <lb/>
            sought by me. That I may omit no one of all these things, <lb/>
            I will prove, before I come to a conclusion, that this, too, <lb/>
            has been falsely laid to my charge. You have asserted that <lb/>
            with a large sum of money belonging to this lady, I have <lb/>
            made purchase in my own name of a very fine estate. I <lb/>
            say, in answer, that it was a small property, worth but sixty <lb/>
            thousand pieces of money; and that I was not the purchaser, <lb/>
            but Pudentilla, who bought the estate in her own name; that <lb/>
            the name of Pudentilla is in the purchase-deed, and that it is <lb/>
            in the name of Pudentilla that the taxes are paid for this farm. <lb/>
            The public qusestor is here present, to whom they have been <lb/>
            paid, Corvinus Celer, a man of the highest character. There is <lb/>
            also here the guardian* and adviser of the lady, a man of the <lb/>
            greatest respectability and of the most unblemished name, one <lb/>
            who deserves to be mentioned by me with all honor and re­ <lb/>
            spect, Cassius Longinus, I mean. Ask him, Maximus, as in <lb/>
            making this purchase he acted as her adviser, at what a trifling <lb/>
            price it was that a lady so wealthy purchased this farm of hers. <lb/>
            [ Cassius Longinus and Corvinus Celer being questioned, gave their <lb/>
            evidence.] Is it not as I said ? Does my name anywhere ap­ <lb/>
            pear in this purchase ? Is the price paid for this little property <lb/>
            any ground for complaint ? Or, at all events, has it been trans­ <lb/>
            ferred to me ?</p>
          <p>What is there still remaining, Æmilianus, that I have not, <lb/>
            in your judgment, refuted? What reward of my magical <lb/>
            practices have you discovered ? Why should I work upon the <lb/>
            feelings of Pudentilla by incantations? To gain what ad­ <lb/>
            vantages from her? Was it that she might make a trifling <lb/>
            settlement upon me in preference to a large one ? 0 charms <lb/>
            of surpassing excellence! Or was it that she might enter <lb/>
            into a new engagement, and settle her fortune in reversion <lb/>
            upon her sons, rather than leave it to me? What else is <lb/>
            there that can possibly be added to such a magic as this ? Is <lb/>
            it the fact that, at my entreaty, she presented the greater por­ <lb/>
            tion of her property to her sons, when, before she was married <note type="footnote"> * The guardian ]-His duties were somewhat similar to those of the <lb/>

            to me, she had given them nothing at all-this, too, while she <lb/>
            bestowed nothing whatever upon myself? Oh atrocious crime, <lb/>
            shall I say, or rather, oh kindness ill repaid ? Or is it rather <lb/>
            the fact that, in the will which she made when angered against <lb/>
            her son, she left that very son with whom she was offended <lb/>
            her heir, rather than myself, to whom she was so much at­ <lb/>
            tached ? This I certainly did, after employing many spells,* <lb/>
            with the greatest difficulty obtain.</p>
          <p>Suppose, now, that this cause is being tried, not before Clau­ <lb/>

            who is an encourager of accusations, and anxious to condemn; <lb/>
            give him some point upon which to fasten, supply him with <lb/>
            ever so slight a ground, wearing the semblance of probability, <lb/>
            on which he may be enabled to pronounce in your favour. At <lb/>
            least, invent, devise something to say by way of answer, when <lb/>
            he invites you so to do. And, as it is a matter of necessity <lb/>
            that some cause or other should precede every effect, state, <lb/>
            you who say that Apuleius influenced the mind of Pudentilla <lb/>
            by magic spells, what it was he wanted of her, and why he <lb/>
            did so. Was it her beauty he was anxious to gain ? You say <lb/>
            no. At all events, was it her riches that he coveted ? The <lb/>
            marriage-contract, the deed of gift, the will, say "no" to that, <lb/>
            in all of which he is shown not only not to have grasped at <lb/>
            with greediness, but even to have harshly repulsed, the libe­ <lb/>

          <p>What other ground then is there ? Why are you mute ? <lb/>

          <p>PLATO has made a triple division of all nature, and especially <lb/>
            of that part of it which comprises animated beings; and he <note type="footnote"> * God.]—In many places, Plato calls the participants of the divinities, <lb/>
            Gods. Thus, in the Laws a divine soul is called ' a God;' and in the <lb/>
            Phædrus, it is said, ' That all the horses and charioteers of the Gods are <lb/>
            good, and consist of things that are good.' And when he says this, he <lb/>
            is speaking of divine souls. After this, also, in the same dialogue, he <lb/>
            still more clearly says, ' And this is the life of the Gods.' What, how­ <lb/>
            ever, is still more remarkable is this, that he denominates those beings <lb/>
            Gods, who are always united to the Gods, and who, together with them, <lb/>
            give completion to one series. For in the Phædrus, Timæus, and other <lb/>
            dialogues, he extends the appellation of the Gods as far as to daemons, <lb/>
            though the latter are essentially posterior to, and subsist about the Gods. <lb/>
            But what is still more paradoxical, he does not refuse to call certain men <lb/>
            Gods : for in the ' Sophista,' he thus denominates the Elean guest or <lb/>
            stranger. </note><note type="footnote"> According to Plato therefore, one thing is a God simply, another on <lb/>
            account of union, another through participation, another through con­ <lb/>
            tact, and another through similitude. For of super-essential natures, <lb/>
            each is primarily a God : of intellectual natures, each is a God according <lb/>
            to union ; and of divine souls, each is a God according to participation. <lb/>
            But divine daemons are Gods, according to contact with the Gods; and <lb/>
            the souls of men are allotted this appellation through similitude. </note><note type="footnote"> As the daemon of Socrates, therefore, was doubtless one of the highest <lb/>
            order, as may be inferred from the intellectual superiority of Socrates to <lb/>
            most other men, Apuleius is justified in calling this dæmon a God. And <lb/>
            that the daemon of Socrates indeed was divine, is evident from the testi­ <lb/>
            mony of Socrates himself in the First Alcibiades : for in the course of <lb/>
            that dialogue he clearly says, ' I have long been of opinion that the God <lb/>
            did not as yet direct me to hold any conversation with you.' And in the <lb/>
            Apology, he most unequivocally evinces that this daemon is allotted a di­ <lb/>
            vine transcendency, considered as ranking in the order of daemons. </note><note type="footnote"> Ignorance of this distinction has been the source of infinite confusion <lb/>
            and absurd hypotheses, to the modern writers on the mythology and the­ <lb/>

            is of opinion, that there are Gods of the highest, the middle, <lb/>
            and the lowest station. Understand, however, that this di­ <lb/>
            vision is based not only upon local separation, but also upon <lb/>
            comparative dignity of nature, which is itself distinguished not <lb/>
            in one or two, but in many modes. It was the clearer way, <lb/>
            however, to begin with the distinction of locality; * for this <lb/>
            has assigned the heavens to the immortal Gods, conformably <lb/>
            to what their majesty demands. And of these celestial Gods, <lb/>
            some we form a notion of by sight, while others we endeavour <lb/>
            to comprehend by the intellect. <lb/>

            Who through the heavens conduct the gliding year.t <lb/>
            We do not, however, perceive by the eyes, those principal Gods <lb/>
            only, the Sun the maker of the day, the Moon the rival of <lb/>
            the Sun, and the glory of night; whether she is horned or <lb/>
            divided,t whether gibbous or full; exhibiting a varying bright­ <lb/>
            ness in her light; being more largely illuminated the farther <lb/>
            she departs from the Sun; and, by an equal increase both of <lb/>
            her path and her light, defining the month by means of her <lb/>
            increments, and afterwards by means of her decrements in like <lb/>
            degree: whether it is, as the Chaldeans think, that she pos­ <lb/>
            sesses a proper or§ permanent light of her own, and is on one <lb/>
            side gifted with light, but destitute of brightness on the other, <lb/>
            and so changes her appearance by manifold revolutions of <lb/>
            her various coloured face; or whether it is that being wholly <lb/>
            void of brightness of her own, and standing in need of foreign <lb/>
            light, with an opaque body, or with a body polished like a <note type="footnote"> * Distinction of locality.]—It is here requisite to observe, that divine <lb/>
            natures are not in bodies, but externally rule over them. Hence they <lb/>
            impart from themselves to bodies every good they are able to receive, but <lb/>
            they themselves receive nothing from bodies ; so that neither will they <lb/>
            derive from them certain peculiarities. By no means, therefore, must it <lb/>
            be admitted (as Iamblichus well observes,) that the cause of the distinc­ <lb/>
            tion of the divine genera is an arrangement with reference to bodies ; as <lb/>

            Whichever of these opinions is true, (for that I shall afterwards <lb/>
            consider,) there is not any Greek, or any barbarian, who will <lb/>
            not easily conclude that the Sun and Moon are Gods; and not <lb/>
            these only, as I have observed, but also the five stars, which <lb/>
            are commonly styled " erratic," or "planets," by the unlearned, <lb/>
            though, in their undeviating, certain, and established course, <lb/>
            they perform, by their divine changes, movements most orderly <lb/>
            and eternal; movements which are indeed various in appear­ <lb/>
            ance, but which are made with a celerity that is always equable, <lb/>
            and represent with wonderful alternation, at one time pro­ <lb/>
            gressions, and at another retrogressions, according to the posi­ <lb/>
            tion, elliptic] ty, and inclination of their orbits, with which he <lb/>
            is well acquainted who understands the risings and settings of <lb/>
            the stars.</p>
          <p>You who are of the same opinion with Plato, must also rank <lb/>
            in the same number of visible Gods those other stars, <lb/>
            The rainy Hyades, Arcturus, both the Bears: * <lb/>
            and likewise the other radiant Gods, by whom we perceive, in <lb/>
            a serene sky, the celestial choir bedecked and crowned, when <lb/>
            the nights are painted with a severe grace and a stern beauty; <lb/>
            beholding, as Ennius says, in this most "perfect shield of the <lb/>
            universe," engravings wrought with surprising brilliancy.</p>
          <p>There is another species of Gods, which nature has denied <lb/>
            to our sight; and still we may contemplate them with admira­ <lb/>
            tion through intellect, acutely surveying them with the eye of <lb/>
            the mind. In the number of these are those twelve Gods † <lb/>
            who are included by Ennius, with a metrical arrangement of <lb/>
            their names, in two verses: <lb/>
            Juno, Vesta, Minerva, Ceres, Diana, Venus, Mars, <lb/>
            Mercurius, Jovi, ‡ Neptunus, Vulcanus, Apollo; <lb/>
            and others of the like kind, whose names, indeed, have been <lb/>

            our minds, our attention being called to them through the <lb/>
            various benefits which they impart to us in the affairs of life <lb/>
            in those things over which they severally preside. The crowd, <lb/>
            however, of the ignorant, who are rejected by Philosophy as <lb/>
            uninitiated, whose notions of holiness are misplaced, who are <lb/>
            deprived of genuine reason, who are destitute of religion; and <lb/>
            incapable of grasping the truth, dishonour the Gods, either by <lb/>
            a worship most over acted, or a most insolent disdain of them; <lb/>
            one part being always in alarm through superstition, while the <lb/>
            other is always swelling with contempt. Very many there are <lb/>
            who venerate all these Gods, established in the lofty heights of <lb/>
            the firmament, and far removed from human contagion : but <lb/>
            not in such manner as they ought: all fear them, but through <lb/>
            ignorance; a few deny their existence, but in a spirit of im­ <lb/>
            piety. Plato thought these Gods to be incorporeal* and ani­ <lb/>
            mated natures without an end. or beginning, but eternal both <lb/>
            with reference to time past and time to come; spontaneously <lb/>
            separated from the contact of the body by the nature peculiar <lb/>
            to themselves; through perfection of intellect possessing su­ <lb/>
            preme beatitude; good, not through participation in any ex­ <lb/>
            traneous good, but of themselves; and able to procure for <lb/>
            themselves every thing requisite, with a facilitywhich is prompt, <lb/>
            simple, unrestrained, and absolute.</p>
          <p>But of the parent of these, who is the lord and author of <lb/>
            all things, and who is free from all obligations to act or to <lb/>
            suffer, not being bound by any necessity to the performance of <lb/>
            any duties, why should I now begin to speak ? For Plato, who <lb/>
            was endowed with a heavenly eloquence, discoursing in lan­ <lb/>
            guage worthy of the immortal Gods, frequently proclaims that <lb/>
            on account of the incredible and ineffable transcendency of his <lb/>
            majesty, he cannot possibly be even in the slightest degree com­ <lb/>
            prehended, under any definition, through the poverty of human <lb/>
            language; and that the intellectual apprehension of this God <lb/>
            can hardly flash upon wise men, when they have separated them- <note type="footnote"> * To be incorporeal.]—The Delphin editor of this treatise, who appears <lb/>
            to have been perfectly ignorant of the philosophy of Plato, says, that <lb/>
            Plato is of an opinion contrary to what is here asserted by Apuleius, in the <lb/>
            Epinomis and in the Timaeus, because, in the former dialogue, he gives to <lb/>
            the celestial Gods a most beautiful, and in the latter an igneous body. <lb/>
            But if rational souls are incorporeal, according to Plato, though con­ <lb/>
            nected with bodies, much more this must be the case with the Gods. </note> <note type="footnote"> A A </note> <lb/>

            with a most instantaneous flash, like a dazzling light amid the <lb/>
            most profound darkness.* I will therefore omit the discussion <lb/>
            of this theme, for which all words adequate to the amplitude of <lb/>
            the subject are not only wanting to me, but could not even be <lb/>
            found by my master Plato. Hence I shall at once sound a <lb/>
            retreat, as to things which very far surpass my humble powers, <lb/>

            in which we men are the principal animated things, though <lb/>
            most of us, through the neglect of training, are so depraved, <lb/>
            and are so imbued with all errors and the most atrocious crimes, <lb/>
            and have become so utterly ferocious, through having nearly <lb/>
            quite abandoned the mildness of our nature, that it may seem <lb/>

          <p>Men, therefore, dwell on the earth, possessing the gift of <lb/>
            speech, having immortal souls, but mortal members, with fri­ <lb/>
            volous and anxious minds, with bodies brutish and infirm, of <lb/>
            dissimilar manners, but similar errors, of presumptuous auda­ <lb/>
            city, long-lived hope, labouring in vain, with variable for­ <lb/>
            tunes, severally mortal, but taken altogether in their whole <lb/>
            species, eternal, quitting the scene in regular succession, and <lb/>
            leaving offspring to supply their place, fleeting in their time, <lb/>
            tardy at gaining wisdom, speedy in meeting with death, and dis­ <lb/>
            satisfied in life. You have, then, in the meantime, two kinds <lb/>
            of animated beings, Gods entirely differing from men, in the <lb/>
            sublimity of their abode, in the eternity of their existence, in <lb/>
            the perfection of their nature, and having no proximate com­ <lb/>
            munication with them; † since those that are supreme are <note type="footnote"> * Profound darkness ]-This is a very remarkable passage, but is not <lb/>
            to be found in any of the writings of Plato that are now extant. Some­ <lb/>
            thing similar to this is said by Plato, in his seventh epistle, respecting the <lb/>
            intuition of idea, or intellectual form; viz. " that from long converse with <lb/>
            the thing itself, accompanied by a life in conformity with it, on a sudden, <lb/>
            a light, as if from a leaping fire, will be enkindled in the soul, and will <lb/>
            there itself nourish itself." </note><note type="footnote"> t Proximate communication with them.]-A divine nature is imme­ <lb/>

             <pb n="355"/>
            separated from the lowest habitations by such a vast interval <lb/>
            of distance; and life is there eternal and never-failing, but <lb/>
            here decaying and interrupted, and the natures are there subli­ <lb/>
            mated to beatitude, while those below are depressed to wretch­ <lb/>
            edness. What then ? Has r ature connected itself by no bond, <lb/>
            but allowed itself to be separated into the divine and human <lb/>
            parts, and to be thus split and crippled, as it were ? For, as the <lb/>
            same Plato remarks, "No God mingles with men." But this <lb/>
            is the principal mark of their sublime nature, that they are not <lb/>
            contaminated by any contact with us.* One part of them <lb/>
            only is to be seen by us with our blunted vision; as the stars, <lb/>
            about whose magnitude and colour men are still in doubt, <lb/>
            while the rest are only known to our understandings, and that <lb/>
            by no prompt perception. This, however, ought by no means <lb/>
            to be wondered at with reference to the immortal Gods, since <lb/>
            even among men, who are raised to opulence by the favour ot <lb/>
            Fortune, and are elevated to the tottering throne and the un­ <lb/>
            steady tribunal of a kingdom, access is rare, all beholders <lb/>
            being kept at a distance, and they enjoy their dignity in re­ <lb/>
            tirement; familiarity breeds contempt, t but privacy gains <lb/>
            admiration.</p>
          <p>" What, then, shall I do," some person may object, "after this <lb/>
            very celestial, but almost inhuman decision of yours? if, so it is, <lb/>
            that men are entirely removed from the immortal Gods, and are <lb/>
            so exiled in these Tartarean realms of earth that all communica­ <lb/>
            tion whatever with the heavenly Gods is denied them, and not <lb/>
            one of the celestials occasionally visits them, as a shepherd visits <lb/>
            his flocks of sheep, a groom his horses, or a herdsman his lowing <lb/>
            cattle, in order that he may curb the more vicious, heal the <lb/>
            diseased, and assist those which are in want ? No God, you <lb/>
            say, interferes in human affairs. To whom, then, shall I ad­ <lb/>
            dress my prayers ? To whom shall I make my vows ? To <lb/>
            -whom shall I immolate victims? Whom shall I invoke through­ <lb/>
            out my whole life, as the helper of the unfortunate, the fa- <lb/>
            vourer of the good, and the adversary of the wicked ? And <lb/>
            whom, in fine, (a thing for which necessity most frequently <note type="footnote"> * Contact with us.]—i.e. By any habitude or alliance to our nature. </note><note type="footnote"> t Breeds contempt.]-' Parit conversatio contemptum,' one of the most <lb/>

            occurs,) shall I adduce as a witness to my oath ? Am I to <lb/>
            say, like Virgil's Ascanius,* <lb/>
            " Now by this head I swear, by which before <lb/>
            My father used to swear ?" <lb/>
            Why, no doubt, Iulus, your father might use this oath among <lb/>
            Trojans, who were allied to him by birth, and also perhaps <lb/>
            among Greeks, who were known to him in battle; but among <lb/>
            the Rutuli, who were but recently known by you, if no one <lb/>
            believed in this head, what God would you have to be surety <lb/>
            for you ? Would you have your right hand and your dart, <lb/>
            like the ferocious Mezentius ? For these only, by which he <lb/>
            defended himself, did he adjure: <lb/>
            " For me ray right hand and the missile dart, <lb/>
            Which now well-poised I hurl, are each a God."t <lb/>
            Away, I beseech you, with such sanguinary Gods; a right <lb/>
            hand weary with slaughter, and a dart rusted with gore. <lb/>
            Neither of these is a fit object for you to adjure, nor that you <lb/>
            should swear by them, for this is an honor that is peculiar to <lb/>
            the highest of the Gods. For a solemn oath, as Ennius says, <lb/>
            is also called Jovisjurandum. What, then, is your opinion ? <lb/>
            Am I to swear by Jupiter, in the shape of a stone, after the <lb/>
            most ancient custom of the Romans ? Why, if the opinion of <lb/>
            Plato is true, that God never mingles with men, a stone will <lb/>
            hear me more easily than Jupiter."</p>
          <p>Such is not the fact: for Plato shall answer for his opinion in <lb/>
            my words. " I do not affirm, " says he, " that the Gods are so far <lb/>
            separated and alienated from us, that not even our prayers can <lb/>
            reach them; for I have not removed them from attention to <lb/>
            the affairs of mankind, but only from contact with them."</p>
          <p>Besides, there are certain divine powers of a middle nature, <lb/>
            situate in this interval of the air, between the highest ether <lb/>
            and the earth below, through whom our aspirations and our <lb/>
            deserts are conveyed to the Gods. These the Greeks call by <lb/>
            name 11 dæmons," and, being placed as messengers between the <lb/>
            inhabitants of earth and those of heaven, they carry from tho <lb/>
            one to the other, prayers and bounties, supplications and as­ <lb/>
            sistance, being a kind of interpreters and message carriers for <note type="footnote"> * Ascantus.]—See Book XI. of the Æneid. </note><note type="footnote"> t See book X. of the AEneid. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="357"/>
            both. Through these same demons, as Plato says in his Sym­ <lb/>
            posium, all revelations, the various miracles of magicians, and <lb/>
            all kinds of presages, are carried on. For specially appointed <lb/>
            individuals of this number, administer everything according to <lb/>
            the province assigned to each; either by framing dreams, or caus­ <lb/>
            ing ominous fissures in entrails, or governing the flights of some <lb/>
            birds, or instructing others in song, or inspiring prophets, or by <lb/>
            launching thunders, or causing the lightning to flash in the clouds, <lb/>
            or other things to take place means of which we obtain a know­ <lb/>
            ledge of future events. And we have reason to believe that all <lb/>
            these particulars are by the will, the power, and the authority <lb/>
            of the celestial Gods, but through the obedience, aid, and ser­ <lb/>
            vices of demons; for it was through the employment, the ser­ <lb/>
            vices, and the care of these, that dreams forewarned Hannibal <lb/>
            of the loss of one of his eyes; that inspection of the entrails <lb/>
            foretold to Flaminius a perilous carnage; and that auguries <lb/>
            assured to Attius Navius the miracle of the whetstone. Just <lb/>
            in the same manner, tokens of future empire are imparted be­ <lb/>
            forehand to certain persons; as, for instance, an eagle hovered <lb/>
            over the cap on the head of Tarquinius Priscus, and a-flame <lb/>
            shone from the head of Servius Tullius. And lastly, to these are <lb/>
            owing all the presages of diviners, the expiatory sacrifices of <lb/>
            the Etrurians, the sacrificial enclosure of places struck by light­ <lb/>
            ning, and the verses of the Sibyls; all which, as I have said, <lb/>
            are effected by certain influences that carry on the communica­ <lb/>
            tion between men and Gods.</p>
          <p>Nor, indeed, would it be conformable to the majesty of the <lb/>
            celestial Gods, that any one of them should either frame a <lb/>
            dream for Hannibal, or withdraw the victim from Flaminius, <lb/>
            or direct the flight of the bird for Attius Navius, or form in <lb/>
            verse the predictions of the Sibyl, or be willing to snatch the <lb/>
            hat from the head of Tarquin, and restore it, or place a <lb/>
            splendid flame upon the head of Servius, but so as not to <lb/>
            burn him. It is not becoming that the Gods of heaven <lb/>
            should condescend to things of this nature. This is the pro­ <lb/>
            vince of the intermediate Gods, who dwell in the regions of <lb/>
            the air, which are adjacent to the earth, and on the confines of <lb/>
            the heavens, just as in each part of the world there are animals <lb/>
            peculiarly adapted to it, those which fly living in the air, and <lb/>
            those which walk, on the earth. For since there are four ele­ <lb/>
            ments universally known, nature being as it were divided into four <lb/>
             <pb n="358"/>
            grand portions, and there are animals peculiar to earth, water, <lb/>
            and flame; (for Aristotle informs us that certain animals pecu­ <lb/>
            liar thereto, and furnished with wings, fly about in burning <lb/>
            furnaces, and pass the whole period of their existence in fire,* <lb/>
            come to life therein, and with it die), and besides this, <lb/>
            since, as we have already observed, so many stars are beheld <lb/>
            floating above in æther, that is to say, in the very brightest <lb/>
            heat of fire,†—since this is the case, why should nature suffer <lb/>
            this fourth element, the air, which is so widely extended, to <lb/>
            be the only one void of every thing, and destitute of its own <lb/>
            inhabitants ? Why should not animated beings be generated <lb/>
            in this air in the same manner as animals that exist in flame <lb/>
            are generated in fire, animals that float, in water, and those <lb/>
            of an earthly nature, on earth ? For you have every reason <lb/>
            to pronounce his opinion false who assigns the birds to the <lb/>
            air; for not one of them raises itself above the summit of <lb/>
            Mount Olympus, which, though it is said to be the highest of <lb/>
            all mountains, yet if you measure its height in a straight line, <lb/>
            the distance to its summit is not equal, according to the <lb/>
            opinions of geometricians, to ten stadia; whereas the immense <lb/>
            mass of air extends as far as the nearest portion of the cycle of <lb/>
            the moon, beyond which æther takes its rise in an upward <lb/>
            direction. What, then, are we to say of such a vast body of <lb/>
            air, which ranges in extent from the nearest part of the revo­ <lb/>
            lutions of the moon as far as the highest summit of Mount <lb/>
            Olympus ? Will that, pray, be destitute of its own appropriate <lb/>
            animated beings, and will this part of nature be without life, <lb/>
            and impotent? Moreover, if you attentively consider the <lb/>
            matter, birds themselves may, with greater propriety, be said <lb/>
            to be terrestrial than aerial animals; for their whole living is <lb/>
            always on the earth; there they procure food, and there they <lb/>
            rest; and they only make a passage through that part of the <lb/>
            air in flying which lies nearest to the earth. But, when they <lb/>
            are wearied by the rowing motion of their wings, the earth is <lb/>
            to them as a harbour. If, therefore, reason evidently requires <lb/>
            that its appropriate animals must also be admitted to exist in <note type="footnote"> * Infire.]—This is asserted by Aristotle, in Book V. chap. xix. of his v <lb/>
            History of Animals. </note><note type="footnote"> t Heat of fire.]-It must be observed, however, that the fire of which <lb/>
            æther consists, and also the stars, for the most part, are, according to Plato, <lb/>
            vivific and unburning. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="359"/>
            the air, it remains for us to consider what they arc, and what <lb/>
            is their nature.</p>
          <p>They are then by no means animals of an earthly nature, <lb/>
            for such have a downward tendency, through their gravity. <lb/>
            But neither are they of a fiery nature, lest they should be <lb/>
            carried aloft by their heat. A certain middle nature, there­ <lb/>
            fore, must be conceived by us, in conformity to the middle <lb/>
            position of their locality, that so the nature of the inhabitants <lb/>
            may be conformable to the nature of the region. Well, then, <lb/>
            let us form in our mind and generate in our ideas bodies so <lb/>
            constituted as neither to be so sluggish as terrestrial, nor so <lb/>
            light as ethereal, but in a certain measure distinct from both, <lb/>
            or else composed of a mixture of both, either removed from, <lb/>
            or modified by, a participation of both. They will, however, <lb/>
            be more easily conceived, if admitted to be a mixture of both, <lb/>
            than if they assumed to be mingled with neither. The bodies <lb/>
            of these demons, therefore, must have some little weight, in <lb/>
            order that they may not be carried aloft; and they must also <lb/>
            have some lightness, in order that they may not be precipitated <lb/>
            to the realms below. However, that I may not appear to you <lb/>
            to be devising things that are incredible, after the manner of <lb/>
            the poets, I will just give you an example of this equipoised <lb/>
            middle nature. We see the clouds unite in a way not much <lb/>
            different from this tenuity of body; but if these were equally <lb/>
            light as those bodies which are entirely devoid of weight, <lb/>
            they would never cap the heights of a lofty mountain with, as <lb/>
            it were, certain wreathed chains, depressed beneath its ridges, <lb/>
            as we frequently perceive they do. On the other hand, if they <lb/>
            were naturally so dense and so ponderous that no union with <lb/>
            a more active levity could elevate them, they would certainly <lb/>
            strike against the earth, of their own tendency, just like a mass <lb/>
            of lead and stone. As it is, however, being pendulous and <lb/>
            moveable, they are guided in this direction and in that by the <lb/>
            winds amid the sea of air, in the same manner as ships, shift- <lb/>
            in- sometimes in proximity and remoteness; for, if they are <lb/>
            teeming with the moisture of water, they are depressed <lb/>
            downward, as though for the purpose of bringing forth. And <lb/>
            on this account it is that clouds that are more moist descend <lb/>
            lower, in dusky masses, and with a slower motion, while those <lb/>
            that are serene ascend higher, and are impelled like fleeces of <lb/>
            wool, in white masses, and with a more rapid flight. Have <lb/>
             <pb n="360"/>
            you not heard how Lucretius most eloquently expresses himself <lb/>
            concerning thunder in his Sixth Book ? <lb/>
            " The azure heavens with dreadful thunders shake. <lb/>
            Because th' ethereal clouds, ascending high, <lb/>
            Dash on each other, driven by adverse winds." <lb/>
            But if the clouds fly aloft, all of which originate from the <lb/>
            earth, and again flow downward to it, pray what should you <lb/>
            conclude as to the bodies of demons, which are so much more <lb/>
            attenuated in their composition ? For they are not heaped <lb/>
            up from feculent vapours and dense mists, as is the nature of <lb/>
            clouds, but they are formed of the most pure liquid and serene <lb/>
            element of air, and on this account they are not visible on <lb/>
            every occasion to the human eye, but only when by divine <lb/>
            command they allow themselves to be seen. For in them no <lb/>
            earthly density occupies the place of light, so as to encounter <lb/>
            our perception, and necessarily to arrest our visual ray by that <lb/>
            solidity; but the lineaments of the bodies which they have <lb/>
            are rare, shining, and attenuated, to such a degree, that <lb/>
            they allow all the rays of our vision to pass through them <lb/>
            in consequence of their rarity, refract them by their bright­ <lb/>
            ness, and baffle them by their subtlety. Hence that de­ <lb/>
            scription of Minerva, in Homer, presenting herself in the <lb/>
            midst of the assembly of the Greeks, for the purpose of check­ <lb/>
            ing the wrath of Achilles. If you will wait a moment I will <lb/>
            give you the Geeek line in Latin, and here it is on the spur of <lb/>
            the moment. Minerva, then, as I said, by the command of <lb/>
            Juno came, in order to moderate the wrath of Achilles, <lb/>
            " Seen by him only, by the rest unseen." * <lb/>
            Hence, also, Virgil's Juturna, when in the midst of many thou­ <lb/>
            sands of men, for the purpose of aiding her brother, <lb/>
            " With soldiers mingled, though by none perceived," t <lb/>
            fully accomplishing that which the captain in Plautus boasted <lb/>
            of having effected by his shield, <lb/>
            " Which dazzled by its light the vision of his foes." <lb/>
            And not to discuss prolixly the rest of the instances, the poets, <lb/>
            from this multitude of demons, are accustomed, in a way by <note type="footnote"> * Unseen.]—Soft perspicua est, aliorum nemo tuetur. Iliad, lib. i. v. 198. </note><note type="footnote"> t Æneid, lib. xii. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="361"/>
            no means remote from the truth, to feign the Gods to be haters <lb/>
            and lovers of certain men, and to give prosperity and promotion <lb/>
            to some, and to oppose and afflict others. Hence, they are in­ <lb/>
            fluenced by pity, moved by indignation, racked with vexation, <lb/>
            elated with joy, and are subject to all the affections of the <lb/>
            human mind; and are agitated by all the fluctuations of <lb/>
            human thought, with similar commotions of the spirit and <lb/>
            agitations of the feelings.* All which storms and tempests <lb/>
            are far alien from the tranquil state of the celestial Gods. For <lb/>
            all the celestials always enjoy the same state -of mind, with an <lb/>
            eternal equanimity, which in them is never driven from its <lb/>
            own fixed state either in the direction of pleasure or of pain; <lb/>
            nor is it moved by any thing from its own everlasting rule, <lb/>
            towards any sudden line of conduct; neither by any external <lb/>
            force, because there is nothing more powerful than deity; nor <lb/>
            of their own impulse, because nothing is more perfect than <lb/>
            deity.</p>
          <p>And furthermore, how can he appear to have been per­ <lb/>
            fect, who moves from a former condition of being to another <lb/>
            condition which is better ? And this the more especially, as <lb/>
            no one spontaneously embraces any thing new, unless he is <lb/>
            tired of what he had before; for a new mode of proceeding <lb/>
            cannot be adopted, without disapproving the preceding modes. <lb/>
            Hence, it follows, that a God ought not to be employed in any <lb/>
            temporal functions either of beneficence or love; and, therefore, <lb/>
            is neither to be influenced by indignation nor by pity, nor to <lb/>
            be disquieted by any anxiety, nor elated by any hilarity; but <lb/>
            he is free from all the passions of the mind, so as never either <lb/>
            to grieve or to rejoice, nor on sudden impulse to will or <lb/>
            unwill.†</p>

            accord with the middle nature of demons.* For they are in­ <lb/>
            termediate between us and the Gods, both in the place of their <lb/>
            habitation, and in their nature ; having immortality in common <lb/>
            with the Gods of heaven, and passions in common with sub­ <lb/>
            ordinate beings. For they are capable, just as we are, of being <lb/>
            affected by all that soothes as well as all that moves the mind; so <lb/>
            as to be stimulated by anger, influenced by pity, allured by gifts, <lb/>
            appeased by prayers, exasperated by affronts, soothed by ho­ <lb/>
            nours, and swayed by all other circumstances, just in the same <lb/>
            way that we are. For, to embrace the nature of them in a de­ <lb/>
            finition, demons are as to genus animated beings, as to mind <lb/>
            rational, as to feelings passive, as to body aerial, as to duration <lb/>
            eternal. Of these five characteristics which I have mentioned, <lb/>
            the three first are the same as those which we possess, the <lb/>
            fourth is peculiar to themselves, and the last they possess in <lb/>
            common with the immortal Gods, from whom they differ in <lb/>
            being subject to passion. Hence, according to my idea, I have <lb/>
            not absurdly called demons passive, because they are subject to <lb/>
            the same perturbations as we are: and on this account it is <lb/>
            that we may place some confidence in the different observances <lb/>
            of religions, and the various propitiatory offerings made in sacred <lb/>
            rites. There are likewise some among this number of Gods who <lb/>
            rejoice in victims, or ceremonies, or observances, nocturnal or <lb/>
            diurnal, public or performed in secret, replete with the greatest <lb/>
            joy or marked with extreme sadness. Thus, the Egyptian deities <lb/>
            are almost all of them delighted with lamentations, the Grecian in <lb/>
            general with dances, and those of the Barbarians with the sound <lb/>
            produced by cymbals, tambourines, and pipes. So. in like <lb/>
            manner, other points relating to sacred rites present consider­ <lb/>
            able diversities, according to different regions; as, for instance, <lb/>
            the crowds that swell the sacred processions, the mysteries, <lb/>
            the duties performed by the priests, and the observances per- <note type="footnote">concerns : for the divinities are perpetually good and profitable, but are <lb/>
            never noxious, and ever subsist in the same uniform mode of being. But <lb/>
            we, when we are virtuous, are conjoined with the Gods through similitude: <lb/>
            but when vicious, we are separated from them through dissimilitude. <lb/>
            And while we live according to virtue, we partake of the Gods, but when <lb/>
            we become evil, we cause them to become our enemies; not that they are <lb/>
            angry, but because guile prevents us from receiving the illuminations of <lb/>
            the Gods, and subjects us to the power of avenging demons." </note><note type="footnote"> * Of demons.]—This, however, applies only to the lowest order of <lb/>

            formed by the devotees: and then, again, the images of the <lb/>

            in the accustomed form peculiar to the usage of each place, so <lb/>
            much so that we have frequently ascertained by means of <lb/>
            dreams, oracles and prophecies especially, that the Divinities <lb/>
            have been indignant, if anything in their sacred rites has been <lb/>
            neglected through slothfulness or contumacy; of which cir­ <lb/>
            cumstances I have an abundance of examples. They are, how­ <lb/>
            ever, so universally mentioned, and so generally known, that <lb/>
            no one could attempt to recount them, without omitting a great <lb/>
            number more than he mentioned. On this account, I shall <lb/>
            desist for the present from expending words upon these parti. <lb/>
            culars, which if they have not obtained assured credit with all <lb/>
            men, still, at least, are universally within the knowledge of all. <lb/>
            It will be more advisable, therefore, to discuss this point in the <lb/>
            Latin tongue, that there are kinds of demons enumerated by <lb/>
            the philosophers, in order that you may more clearly and more <lb/>
            fully come to an understanding on the presage of Socrates, and <lb/>
            his familiar demon.</p>
          <p>Now, according to a certain signification, the human soul, <lb/>
            even when it is still situate in the body, is called a demon. <lb/>
            " 0 say, Euryalus, do Gods inspire <lb/>
            In minds this ardour, or does fierce desire <lb/>
            Rule as a God in its possessor's breast ?"* <lb/>
            If, then, this is the case, a longing of the soul that is of gooa <lb/>
            tendency is a good demon. Hence it is that some think, as we <lb/>
            have already observed, that the blessed are called <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐυδαίμονες</foreign>, <lb/>
            eudæmones, the demon of whom is good, that is, whose mind is <lb/>
            perfect in virtue. You may call this demon in our language, <lb/>
            according to my mode of interpretation, by the name of <lb/>
            " Genius," whether quite correctly I am not altogether sure, <lb/>
            but at all events, at any risk you may so call it; because this <lb/>
            God, who is the mind of every one,† though immortal, is never- <note type="footnote"> * These verses are taken from Book IX. of the Æneid. </note><note type="footnote"> t Every one.]—" The soul," says Proclus, in his Commentary on the <lb/>

            produces energies more wonderful than those which belong to human na. <lb/>

            according to habitude' (i. e. proximity or alliance). But an essential de. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="364"/>
            theless, after a certain manner, generated with man; so that <lb/>
            those prayers in which we implore the Genius, and which we <lb/>
            employ when we embrace the knees [genua] of those whom <lb/>
            we supplicate, seem to me to testify this connexion and <lb/>
            union, since they comprehend in two words the body and <lb/>
            the mind, through the communion and conjunction of which <lb/>
            we exist.</p>
          <p>There is also another species of demons, according to a se­ <lb/>
            cond signification, and this is the human soul, after it has per­ <lb/>
            formed its duties in the present life, and quitted the body: I <lb/>
            find that this is called in the ancient Latin language by the <lb/>
            name of Lemur. Now, of these Lemures, the one who, under­ <lb/>
            taking the guardianship of his posterity, dwells in a house <lb/>
            with propitious and tranquil influence, is called the "familiar" <lb/>
            Lar. But those who, having no fixed habitation of their own, <lb/>
            are punished with vague wandering, as with a kind of exile, <lb/>
            on account of the evil deeds of their life, are usually called <lb/>
            "Larvæ," thus becoming a vain terror to the good, but a <lb/>
            source of punishment to the bad. But when it is uncertain <lb/>
            what is the allotted condition of any one of these, and whether <lb/>
            it is Lar or Larva, it is called a God Manes ; the name of God <lb/>
            being added for the sake of honor. For those only are called <lb/>
            Gods, who being of the number of the Lemures, and having <lb/>
            regulated the course of their life justly and prudently, have <lb/>
            afterwards been celebrated by men as divinities, and are uni­ <lb/>
            versally worshipped with temples, and religious rites; such, <lb/>
            for instance, as Amphiaraus in Boeotia, Mopsus in Africa, Osiris <lb/>
            in Egypt, and others in other nations, but Esculapius every­ <lb/>
            where. All this distribution, however, has been made of <lb/>
            those demons, who once existed in a human body.</p>
          <p>But there is another species of demons, more exalted and <lb/>
            august, not fewer in number, but far superior in dignity, who, <lb/>
            being for ever liberated from the bonds and conjunction of the <lb/>
            body, preside over certain powers. In the number of these <lb/>
            are Sleep and Love, who possess powers of a different nature; <lb/>
            Love, of exciting to wakefulness, Sleep of lulling to rest. <note type="footnote"> mon is neither called a demon through habitude to secondary natures, nor <lb/>
            through an assimilation to something different from himself; but is al­ <lb/>
            lotted this peculiarity from himself, and is defined by a certain summit, or <lb/>
            flower of essence, by appropriate powers, and by different modes of <lb/>
            energies." </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="365"/>
            From this more elevated order of demons, Plato is of opinion <lb/>
            that a peculiar demon is allotted to every man, to be a witness <lb/>
            and a guardian* of his conduct in life, who, without being <lb/>
            visible to any one, is always present, and is an overseer not <lb/>
            only of his actions, but even of his thoughts. But when life <lb/>
            is finished, and THE SOUL has to return to its judges, then the <lb/>
            demon who has presided over it immediately seizes, and leads <lb/>
            it as his charge to judgment, and is there present with it while <lb/>
            it pleads its cause; and censures it if it is guilty of any un­ <lb/>
            truthfulness ; corroborates what it says, if it asserts what is <lb/>
            true; and conformably to its testimony, sentence is passed. All <lb/>
            you, therefore, who hear this divine opinion of Plato, as ex­ <lb/>
            plained by me, so adapt your minds to whatever you may have <lb/>
            to do, or to whatever may be the subject of your meditation, as <lb/>
            men who know that there is nothing concealed from those <lb/>
            guardians either within the mind or external to it; but that <lb/>
            the demon scrupulously takes part in all these matters, sees <lb/>
            all things, understands all things, and dwells in the most <lb/>
            profound recesses of the mind, in the place of conscience. † <note type="footnote"> * A guardian.]—According to Plato, our guardian demons belong to <lb/>
            that order of demons which is arranged under the Gods that preside over <lb/>
            the ascent and descent of souls. Olympiodorus, in his Commentary on <lb/>
            the Phædo of Plato, observes, " that there is one demon who leads the <lb/>
            soul to its judges from the present life; another who is ministrant to the <lb/>
            judges, giving completion, as it were, to the sentence which is passed; <lb/>
            and a third, who is again allotted the guardianship of life." </note><note type="footnote"> t Of conscience.]—In the original, in ipsis peritissimis mentibus vice <lb/>
            conscientiæ diversetur. This is a most remarkable passage, since it per­ <lb/>
            fectly accords with what Olympiodorus says of our allotted demon, in his <lb/>
            Scholia on the First Alcibiades of Plato, and contains a dogma concern­ <lb/>
            ing this demon, which is only to be found explicitly maintained in these <lb/>
            Scholia. The words of Olympiodorus are as follows:—" This is what is <lb/>
            said by the interpreters [of Plato] concerning demons, and those which <lb/>
            are allotted to us. We, however, shall endeavour to discuss these parti­ <lb/>
            culars in such a way as to reconcile them with what is at present said by <lb/>
            Plato; for Socrates was condemned to take poison, in consequence of in­ <lb/>
            troducing to young men novel demoniacal powers, and for thinking those <lb/>
            to be Gods which were not admitted to be so by the city. It must be <lb/>
            said, therefore, that the allotted demon is conscience, which is the supreme <lb/>
            flower of the soul, is guiltless in us, is an inflexible judge, and a witness <lb/>
            to Minos and Rhadamanthus of the transactions of the present life. This <lb/>
            also becomes the cause to us of our salvation, as always remaining in us <lb/>
            without guilt, and not assenting to the errors of the soul, but disdaining <lb/>
            them, and converting the soul to what is proper. You will not err, there-</note> <lb/>
             <pb n="366"/>
            He of whom I speak is entirely our guardian, our individual <lb/>
            keeper, our watcher at home, our own proper regulator, a <note type="footnote"> fore, in calling the allotted demon conscience. But it is requisite to know <lb/>
            that, of conscience, one kind pertains to our gnostic powers, and which <lb/>
            is denominated conscience (co-intelligence), homonymously with the genus." <lb/>
            In this passage, as Creuzer, the editor of these Scholia, well observes, <lb/>
            something is wanting at the end; and a part of what is deficient, I con­ <lb/>
            ceive to be the words, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὸτ δὲ ἐπὶ ταϊς ζωτίκαις</foreign>, i. e. but another kind to <lb/>
            our vital powers; for the great division of the powers of the soul is into <lb/>
            the gnostic and vital. </note><note type="footnote"> The singularity in this dogma of Olympiodorus, respecting our allotted <lb/>
            demon, is, that in making it to be the same with conscience, if conscience <lb/>
            is admitted to be a part of the soul, the dogma of Plotinus must also be <lb/>
            admitted, " that the whole of our soul does not enter into the body, but <lb/>
            that something belonging to it always abides in the intelligible world." <lb/>
            But this dogma appears to have been opposed by all the Platonists pos­ <lb/>
            terior to Plotinus ; and Proclus has confuted it in the last proposition of <lb/>
            his Elements of Theology; for he there demonstrates, " that every par­ <lb/>
            tial soul, in descending into generation [or the sublunary realms], descends <lb/>
            wholly ; nor does one part of it remain on high, and another part de­ <lb/>
            scend." But his demonstration of this is as follows :—" For if something <lb/>
            pertaining to the soul remain on high, in the intelligible world, it will <lb/>
            always perceive intellectually, without transition, or transitively. But if <lb/>
            Without transition, it will be intellect, and not a part of the soul, and <lb/>
            this partial soul will proximately participate of intellect [i. e. not through <lb/>
            the medium of demoniacal and divine souls]. This, however, is impos­ <lb/>
            sible. But if it perceives intellectually with transition, from that which <lb/>
            always, and from that which sometimes, energizes intellectually, one <lb/>
            essence will be formed. This, however, is also impossible; for these <lb/>
            always differ, as has been demonstrated. To which may be added, the <lb/>
            absurdity resulting from supposing that the summit of the soul is always <lb/>
            perfect, and yet does not rule over the other powers, and cause them to <lb/>
            be perfect. Every partial soul, therefore, wholly descends." Hence, if <lb/>
            Olympiodorus was likewise hostile to this dogma of Plotinus, it must <lb/>
            follow, according to him, that conscience is not a part of the soul, but <lb/>
            something superior to it, and dwelling in its summit. Perhaps, therefore, <lb/>
            Olympiodorus on this account calls the allotted demon the supreme <lb/>
            flower of the soul. For the summit, or the one of the soul, is frequently <lb/>
            called by Platonic writers, rb <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἃνθος</foreign>, the flower, but not <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἂκϱον ἂνθος</foreign>, <lb/>
            the supremeflower; so that the addition of supreme will distinguish the <lb/>
            presiding daemon from the summit of the soul. The place in which this <lb/>
            dogma of Plotinus is to be found, is at the end of his treatise on the <lb/>
            Descent of the Soul. </note><note type="footnote"> I only add, that the celebrated poet Menander appears to have been <lb/>
            the source of this dogma, that conscience is our allotted demon; for one <lb/>

            Do you not very clearly perceive in Homer, as in a kind of <lb/>
            large mirror, these two properties of divination and of wisdom <lb/>
            separated widely from each other ? For when those two pillars <lb/>
            of the whole expedition disagreed, Agamemnon potent in sway, <lb/>
            and Achilles powerful in battle, and a man famed for his elo­ <lb/>
            quence and renowned for his skill, was wanting, who might <lb/>
            allay the pride of the son of Atreus, and curb the anger of the son <lb/>
            of Peleus, command the attention of both by the weight of his <lb/>
            character, admonish them by examples, and soothe them by his <lb/>
            words; who, then, on such an occasion undertook to speak ? <lb/>
            Why, Ne8tor, the Pylian orator, who was so bland in his elo­ <lb/>
            quence, wary through experience, and venerable for his age ; <lb/>
            who was known by all to have a body weakened by years, but <lb/>
            a mind vigorous in counsel, and words flowing with honeyed <lb/>
            sweetness.</p>
          <p>In like manner, when in dubious and adverse circumstances, <lb/>
            spies are to be chosen, to penetrate into the camp of the <lb/>
             <pb n="368"/>
            enemy at midnight, are not Ulysses and Diomedes selected for <lb/>
            that purpose, as counsel and aid, mind and hand, spirit and <lb/>
            sword ? But, on the other hand, when the Greeks are detained <lb/>
            in Aulis, kept back by the winds, and through weariness are <lb/>
            shrinking from the difficulties of the war; when the means of <lb/>
            proceeding, the tranquillity of the sea, and the clemency of the <lb/>
            winds, have to be ascertained by means of the indications of <lb/>
            the entrails, the courses taken by birds, and the food de­ <lb/>
            voured by serpents ;* then were those two supreme summits of <lb/>
            the Grecian wisdom, the Ithacan and the Pylian, both of them <lb/>
            silent; but Calchas, who was far more skilful in divining, as <lb/>
            soon as he had surveyed the birds, and the altars, and the tree, <lb/>
            immediately through his divination appeased the tempests, <lb/>
            brought the fleet out to the sea, and foretold a war which <lb/>
            should last ten years. Just so in the Trojan army also, when <lb/>
            affairs required the aid of divination, that wise senate is silent, <lb/>
            nor does either Hicetaon, Lampus, or Clytius, presume to give <lb/>
            any opinion; but all of them listen in silence, either to the <lb/>
            distasteful auguries of Helenus, or to the discredited predic­ <lb/>
            tions of Cassandra. After the same manner, Socrates too, if at <lb/>
            any time advice not within the province of wisdom was re­ <lb/>
            quisite, was then governed by the prophetic power of his <lb/>
            dmeon; and he was sedulously attentive to his admonitions, <lb/>
            and on that account was acceptable in a far higher degree to <lb/>
            his God.</p>
          <p>The reason also, has been in some measure already stated, <lb/>
            why the demon of Socrates was generally in the habit of for­ <lb/>
            bidding him to do certain things, but never exhorted him to <lb/>
            the performance of any act. For Socrates, being of himself a <lb/>
            man exceedingly perfect, and prompt to the performance of all <lb/>
            requisite duties, never stood in need of any one to exhort him; <lb/>
            though sometimes he required one to forbid him, if danger <lb/>
            happened to lurk in any of his undertakings; in order that, <lb/>
            being admonished, he might use due precaution, and desist for <lb/>
            the present from his attempt, either to resume it more safely <note type="footnote"> * Devoured by serpents.] —Apuleius here alludes to the serpent which, <lb/>
            in the presence of the Greeks at Aulis. ascended into a plane tree, and <lb/>
            devoured eight little sparrows, together with their mother. Whence <lb/>
            Calchas prophesied that the Trojan war would last nine years, but that <lb/>
            the city would be captured in the tenth year. See the Iliad, lib. ii. <lb/>
            7. 300. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="369"/>
            at a future period, or enter upon it in some other way. On <lb/>
            occasions of this kind, he used to say, " That he heard a cer­ <lb/>
            tain voice, which proceeded from the divinity." For so it is <lb/>
            asserted by Plato; and let no one suppose that he was in the <lb/>
            habit of deriving omens from the ordinary conversation of men. <lb/>
            Once, for example, when he was with Phsedrus, beyond the <lb/>
            precincts of the city, under the covering of a shady tree, <lb/>
            and at a distance from all overlookers, he perceived a sign <lb/>
            which announced to him that he must not pass over the small <lb/>
            stream of the river llissus, until he had appeased Love, who <lb/>
            was indignant at his censure of him, by a recantation.* And <lb/>
            then, besides, if he had been an observer of omens, he would <lb/>
            sometimes also have received positive encouragement from them, <lb/>
            as we see frequently the case with many of those, who, through <lb/>
            a too superstitious observance of omens, are not directed by their <lb/>
            own minds, but by the words of others; and who creeping <lb/>
            about the lanes, gather counsel from the remarks of strangers, <lb/>
            and, if I may use the expression, do not think with the under­ <lb/>
            standing, but with the ears.</p>
          <p>But be this as it may, it is certain that those who hear. the <lb/>
            words of soothsayers, generally receive a voice with their ears, <lb/>
            concerning the nature of which they have no doubt, and which <lb/>
            they know to proceed from the human mouth. But Socrates <lb/>
            did not simply say that he heard a voice, but a 11 certain <lb/>
            voice," transmitted to him: by which addition, you must <lb/>
            certainly understand, that neither an ordinary nor a human <lb/>
            voice is signified; for had it been so, it would have been no <lb/>
            use to say a " certain" voice, but rather 11 a voice," " or the. <lb/>
            voice of some one," as the courtesan in Terence says, <lb/>
            " I thought just now I heard the captain's voice."t <lb/>
            But he who says that he heard a certain voice, is either igno­ <lb/>
            rant whence that voice originated, or is in some doubt con­ <lb/>
            cerning it, or shows that it had something unusual and mys­ <lb/>
            terious about it, as Socrates did of that voice, which he said <lb/>
            was transmitted to him opportunely and from a divine source. <lb/>
            And, indeed, I think that he used to perceive indications of his <lb/>
            demon, not only with his ears, but even with his eyes; for he <note type="footnote"> * Recantation.]—See the Phædrus of Plato. </note><note type="footnote"> t Voice.]—' Audire vocem visa sum modo militis.' This verse is from <lb/>
            the Eunuch of Terence. </note> <note type="footnote"> B B </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="370"/>
            very frequently declared that not a voice, but a divine sign, <lb/>
            had been presented to him. This sign too might have been <lb/>
            the form of his demon, which Socrates alone beheld, just as, <lb/>
            in Homer, Achilles beheld Minerva.</p>
          <p>I suppose that most of you will with difficulty believe what I <lb/>
            have just said, and will greatly wonder what was the form of <lb/>
            the demon Socrates was in the habit of seeing. Aristotle, <lb/>
            however, who is a pretty good authority, I think, informs us that <lb/>
            it was usual with the Pythagoreans to express great surprise <lb/>
            if any one denied that he had ever seen a demon. If, there­ <lb/>
            fore, the power of beholding a divine form may be possessed <lb/>
            by any one, why might it not, in an especial degree, fall to <lb/>
            the lot of Socrates, whom the dignity of wisdom rendered <lb/>
            equal to the very highest divinity? For nothing is more <lb/>
            similar and more acceptable to Deity, than a man intellectually <lb/>
            good in a perfect degree, for he as much excels other men as <lb/>
            he himself is surpassed by the immortal Gods. Do we not, <lb/>
            then, ourselves feel elevated by the example and mention of <lb/>
            Socrates ? And ought we not to devote ourselves to the feli­ <lb/>
            citous study of a like philosophy, and stand in awe of like <lb/>
            Divinities ? A study from which we allow ourselves to be <lb/>
            drawn away, for what reason I know not. And nothing is <lb/>
            there which excites in me so much surprise, as that all men <lb/>
            should desire to live most happily, and should know that they <lb/>
            cannot so live in any other way than by cultivating the mind, <lb/>
            and yet leave their minds uncultivated. Just so, if any one <lb/>
            wishes to see clearly, it is requisite that he should pay atten­ <lb/>
            tion to his eyes by which he sees ; if he desires to run swiftly, <lb/>
            attention must be paid to the feet by which he runs; and so, <lb/>
            too, if you wish to be a stout pugilist, your arms must be <lb/>
            strengthened with which you engage in that exercise. So it <lb/>
            is with all the other members; the care of each must be made <lb/>
            your study. And, as all men may easily see that this is true, <lb/>
            I cannot sufficiently account to myself, and wonder to the <lb/>
            extent that the thing deserves, why they do not, with the aid <lb/>
            of reason, cultivate their minds. For this art of living is <lb/>
            equally necessary for all; whereas the same is not the case <lb/>
            with the art of painting, nor with the art of singing, which <lb/>
            any worthy man may despise, without any censure upon his <lb/>
            understanding, without baseness, and without disgrace. I <lb/>
            know not how to play on the flute like Ismenias, still I feel <lb/>
             <pb n="371"/>
            no shame that I am not a player on the flute : I know not <lb/>
            how to paint in colours like Apelles, nor to carve like Lysip­ <lb/>
            pus, still I am not, ashamed that I am not an artist; and the <lb/>
            same as to other arts, not to recount them all individually; <lb/>
            you are at liberty to be ignorant of them, and yet not to feel <lb/>
            ashamed. But, on the other hand, be good enough to say, I <lb/>
            know not how to live aright as Socrates, as Plato, and as <lb/>
            Pythagoras lived, and I feel no shame that I know not how to <lb/>
            live aright. This you will never dare to say.</p>
          <p>It is, however, especially to be wondered at, that people <lb/>
            should still neglect to learn those things of which they by no <lb/>
            means wish to appear ignorant, and shun at one and the same <lb/>
            moment, both acquaintance with and ignorance of the same <lb/>
            art. Hence, if you examine their daily outlay, you will <lb/>
            find that they are prodigally profuse in their ordinary ex­ <lb/>
            penditure, but bestow nothing on themselves; I mean on <lb/>
            proper attention to their demon, which proper attention is <lb/>
            nothing else than the secret obligations of philosophy. They <lb/>
            build sumptuous villas, no doubt, richly decorate their houses, <lb/>
            and collect a numerous household; but in all these, and amidst <lb/>
            such vast affluence, there is nothing to be ashamed of but the <lb/>
            master himself, and with good reason; for they have an accu­ <lb/>
            mulation of things which they have collected with exquisite <lb/>
            care, while they themselves wander about among them, rude, <lb/>
            uncultivated, and ignorant.</p>
          <p>Accordingly, you will find the things on which they have <lb/>
            lavished their patrimony, to be most pleasing to the view, and <lb/>
            most exquisitely built; villas raised that rival cities, houses <lb/>
            decorated like temples, most numerous retinues of servants, <lb/>
            with carefully curled locks, costly furniture, every thing be­ <lb/>
            tokening affluence, every thing bespeaking opulence, every <lb/>
            thing bearing marks of refinement, except the master himself; <lb/>
            who alone, just like Tantalus, needy, poor, and in want in the <lb/>
            midst of his riches, though he does not snatch at retreating <lb/>
            fruit, nor endeavour to quench his thirst with shifting water, <lb/>
            still hungers and thirsts for want of true beatitude, that is to <lb/>
            say, a genuine life,* and a happy and discreet existence. For <lb/>
            he does not perceive that it is usual to look upon rich men in <lb/>
            the same way that we do horses when we buy them; for in <note type="footnote"> * Genuine life.]—In the common text, ' secundæ vitæ;' but we read, <lb/>
            with the Roman edition, ' sinceræ vitae.' </note> <note type="footnote"> B B 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="372"/>
            purchasing horses we do not look to the trappings, nor the <lb/>
            decorations of the belt, nor do we contemplate the riches of <lb/>
            the neck with all its ornaments, and examine whether chains <lb/>
            of various patterns, and made of silver, gold, or gems, are <lb/>
            hanging from it; whether elaborate baubles surround the head <lb/>
            and neck; whether the bits are embossed, the saddle painted, <lb/>
            and the girths gilt; but all this outside show being removed, <lb/>
            we survey the bare horse itself, and direct our attention only <lb/>
            to his body and his temper, in order to ascertain whether he <lb/>
            is of handsome form, vigorous for the race, and strong for <lb/>
            purposes of carriage. In the first place, we consider whether <lb/>
            there is in his body <lb/>
            " A head that's slender, and a belly small, <lb/>
            A back obese, and animated breast, <lb/>
            In brawny flesh luxuriant."* <lb/>
            And besides, whether a twofold spine passes along his loins; <lb/>
            for I would have him not only to carry me swiftly, but to <lb/>
            afford me an easy seat.</p>
          <p>In a similar manner, therefore, in examining men, do not <lb/>
            take into account these foreign particulars, but closely consider <lb/>
            the man himself, and look upon him in a state of poverty, as <lb/>
            was my Socrates. But I call those things foreign which our <lb/>
            parents have produced, and which Fortune has bestowed, none <lb/>
            of which do I mingle with the praises of my Socrates; no <lb/>
            nobility of birth, no high pedigree, no long line of ancestors, <lb/>
            no envied riches, for all these, I say, are foreign. It is glory <lb/>
            sufficient derived from Protaonius, if he was such a man that <lb/>
            he was not a disgrace to his grandson. In like manner, may <lb/>
            you enumerate every thing of a foreign nature. Is he of noble <lb/>
            birth ? You praise his parents. Is he rich ? I put no trust <lb/>
            in Fortune; nor do I admire these things a bit the more. Is <lb/>
            he strong ? He will be weakened by sickness. Is he swift <lb/>
            in the race ? He will fall into old age. Is he beautiful ? <lb/>
            Wait a little, and he will be so no longer. But is he well in­ <lb/>
            structed, and extremely learned in the pursuits of philosophy, <lb/>
            and wise, and skilled in the knowledge of good, as much as it <lb/>
            is possible for man to be? Now, then, at last you praise the <lb/>
            man himself. , For this is neither an hereditary possession <lb/>
            from his father, nor depending on chance, nor yet on the suf­ <lb/>
            frages of the people, nor subject to bodily decay, nor mutable <note type="footnote"> * These lines are taken from Book III. of the Georgies of Virgil. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="373"/>
            through age. All these my Socrates possessed, and therefore <lb/>
            cared not for the possession of other things. Why, then, do <lb/>
            not you apply yourself to the study of wisdom, or, at least, <lb/>
            strive that you may hear nothing of an alien nature in your <lb/>
            praises? but that he who wishes to compliment you, may <lb/>
            praise you in the same manner as Accius praises Ulysses, in <lb/>
            his Philoctetes, where he says, at the beginning of that tragedy <lb/>
            " Fam'd hero, in a little island born, <lb/>
            Of celebrated name and powerful mind, <lb/>
            Once to the Grecian ships war's leading light, <lb/>
            And to the Dardan race th' avenger dire, <lb/>
            Son of Laertes." <lb/>
            He mentions his father last of all. But you have heard al- <lb/>
            the praises of that man; Laertes, Anticlea, and Acrisius, claim <lb/>
            no share of it. The whole of the praises are, as you see, a <lb/>
            possession belonging to Ulysses alone. Nor does Homer teach <lb/>
            you anything else with regard to the same Ulysses, in always <lb/>
            representing Wisdom as his companion, whom he poetically <lb/>
            calls Minerva. Hence, attended by her, he encounters all <lb/>
            terrific dangers, and rises superior to all adverse circumstances. <lb/>
            For, assisted by her, he entered the cavern of the Cyclops, but <lb/>
            escaped from it; saw the oxen of the Sun, but abstained from <lb/>
            them, and descended to the realms beneath, but emerged from <lb/>
            them. With the same Wisdom for his companion, he passed <lb/>
            by Scylla, and was not seized by her; he was surrounded by <lb/>
            Charybdis, and was not retained by her; he drank the cup of <lb/>
            Circe, and was not transformed; he came to the Lotophagi, <lb/>
            yet did not remain with them; he heard the Sirens, yet did <lb/>
            not approach them.* <note type="footnote"> * Approach them,.]—The concluding part of this treatise on the God <lb/>
            of Socrates has a great resemblance to the conclusion of the dissertation <lb/>
            of Maximus Tyrius, entitled, Whether there is a Sect in Philosophy, <lb/>
            according to Homer ? and which is as follows: " And with respect to <lb/>
            Ulysses himself, do you not see how virtue, and the confidence which he <lb/>
            acquires through her aid, preserve him, while he opposes art to all-various <lb/>
            calamities ? This is the moly in the island of Circe, this is the fillet in <lb/>
            the sea, this delivered him from the hands of Polyphemus, this led him <lb/>
            from Hades, this constructed for him a raft, this persuaded Alcinous, this <lb/>
            enabled him to endure the blows of the suitors, the wrestling with Irus, <lb/>
            and the insolence of Melanthius. This liberated his palace, this avenged <lb/>
            the injuries of his wife, this made the man a descendant of Jupiter, like <lb/>
            the Gods, and such a one as the happy man is according to Plato." </note></p>

            my hurry. For the traveller can find no fitter motives for <lb/>
            a religious pause in an altar decked with flowers, or a dell <lb/>
            shaded with foliage, or an oak loaded with horns, or a beech <lb/>
            festooned with skins, or even a consecrated and enclosed hil­ <lb/>
            lock, or a trunk chiselled into the form of an image, or a turf <lb/>
            redolent of libation, or a stone bedewed with ointment. These <lb/>
            are small things indeed, and though adored by the few who <lb/>
            scrutinise them, are passed unnoticed by those who are not <lb/>
            aware of them.</p>

          <p>But not so my predecessor, Socrates, who, when he had <lb/>
            looked for some time upon a handsome but silent youth, ex­ <lb/>
            claimed : " Say something, that I may see you." Socrates saw <lb/>
            not a silent man; for he thought that men were to be considered <lb/>
            not with the eyes, but with the rays of the intellect and the <lb/>
            gaze of the soul. In this he differed in opinion with the <lb/>
            soldier in Plautus, who says : " One eye-witness is worth more <lb/>
            than ten ear-witnesses." Nay, he held the converse of this <lb/>
            verse with regard to the examination of men: " One ear- <lb/>
            witness is worth more than ten eye-witnesses." But if the <lb/>
            judgments formed by the eyes were more valued than those of <lb/>
            the mind, the palm of wisdom would be due to the eagle. For <lb/>
            we men can neither discern things far away nor very near us, <lb/>
            but are all in a measure blind ; and if you consider us only <lb/>
             <pb n="375"/>
            with regard to our eyes, and our earthly and dull vision, truly <lb/>
            the great poet has well said that there is a mist, as it were, <lb/>
            before our eyes, and that we cannot see clearly beyond a stone's <lb/>
            throw. But the eagle when he has soared aloft as high as the <lb/>
            clouds, sweeping with his wings all that space in which it <lb/>
            rains and snows, a height beyond which there 's. no place for <lb/>
            the thunder or lightning, on the very base of the ether and <lb/>
            summit of the tempest, so to speak; the. eagle when he has <lb/>
            soared thither, glides along bodily, with a gentle inclination left <lb/>
            or right, turning his sail-spread wings in whatever direction he <lb/>
            pleases, using his tail as a small helm. Looking down thence <lb/>
            on all below him, with unwearied rowing of his wings, and with <lb/>
            his flight stayed awhile, he remains at gaze suspended nearly in <lb/>
            the same spot, and considers in what direction he shall swoop <lb/>
            down on his prey like a thunderbolt; seeing at one glance, <lb/>
            himself unseen in the heavens, cattle in the fields, wild beasts <lb/>
            on the mountains, and men in the towns, he considers where <lb/>
            he may pierce with his beak or hook with his talons a heed­ <lb/>
            less lamb or timid hare, or any living thing that chance may <lb/>
            offer him to tear and devour.</p>

          <p>Hyagnis, as we have heard say, was the father and teacher <lb/>
            of Marsyas the flute-player, and surpassed all in his perform­ <lb/>
            ance in an age as yet uncultivated in music; not that he <lb/>
            played, indeed, with such soul-subduing tone as later musicians, <lb/>
            or with such manifold modulations, or on a pipe of so many <lb/>
            holes; for the art had been but recently invented, and was <lb/>
            then in its infancy. Nothing can be perfect in the beginning, <lb/>
            but in almost all cases some rudiment of the promised thing <lb/>
            precedes its consummation. Before Hyagnis appeared then, <lb/>
            most people could do no more than, like the shepherd or neat- <lb/>
            herd in Virgil, <lb/>
            " Grate on their scrannel pipes of wretched straw."* <lb/>
            And if there was any one who appeared to have made some­ <lb/>
            what more progress in the art, even he too, followed the common <lb/>
            practice of playing only on one pipe, just as on one trumpet. <lb/>
            Hyagnis was the first who separated the hands in playing; the <lb/>
            first who gave breath to two pipes ; the first who mingled a <note type="footnote"> * Grate, &amp;c.]—This line, from Milton's Lycidas, is a pretty close trans­ <lb/>
            lation of one from Virgil's third eclogue. </note> <lb/>

            shrill and a grave tone in musical concert, by means of left <lb/>
            and right apertures. His son Marsyas, when he had acquired <lb/>
            the paternal art of minstrelsy-a Phrygian and a barbarian <lb/>
            he was, a rough brutish-looking fellow, hirsute, with a dirty <lb/>
            beard, covered with bristles and hairs,-is said (oh monstrous!) <lb/>
            to have contended with Apollo: a Thersites with a beautiful <lb/>
            youth, a clown with a scholar, a brute with a god! The Muses <lb/>
            with Minerva sat as. judges by way of a joke, to laugh at <lb/>
            the barbarity of that monster, and no less to punish his stu­ <lb/>
            pidity. But Marsyas, not perceiving that he was made a <lb/>
            laughing stock, which is the greatest proof of folly, before he <lb/>
            began to play, sputtered out some barbarous nonsense about <lb/>
            himself and Apollo, praising himself because he had short <lb/>
            crisp hair, a squalid beard, a shaggy breast, was in art a flute- <lb/>
            player, and in fortune needy ; on the other hand, ridiculous to <lb/>
            relate, he decried the opposite merits as so many faults in <lb/>
            Apollo, saying: that Apollo had unshorn locks, a handsome <lb/>
            face, and a smooth body; that he was of manifold proficiency <lb/>
            in art, and opulent in fortune. In the first place, said he, his <lb/>
            locks flow freely, those in front being drawn forward, those be­ <lb/>
            hind tossed back ; his whole form is beautiful; his limbs are <lb/>
            smooth and fair; his tongue is prophetic, and endowed with <lb/>
            equal eloquence in prose and verse. What! his garment is <lb/>
            fine in texture, soft to the touch, and glowing with purple. <lb/>
            What! his lyre is ruddy with gold, white with ivory, and <lb/>
            variegated with gems. What! he trills most skilfully and most <lb/>
            sweetly. " All these prettinesses," he says, " are by no means <lb/>
            becoming to virtue, but adapted to luxury, whereas the native <lb/>
            quality of my own person exhibits the greatest comeliness." <lb/>
            The Muses laughed when they heard things like these, which <lb/>
            a wise man might well desire, charged as crimes against Apollo ; <lb/>
            and when the flute-player had been beaten in the contest, they <lb/>
            left him, like a two-footed bear, stripped of his skin, with his <lb/>
            flesh naked and torn. Thus Marsyas played for punishment <lb/>
            and suffered it. But Apollo was ashamed of so low a victory.</p>

          <p>Antigenidas was a certain flute-player, a honeyed modulator <lb/>
            of every tone, and a skilled performer in every mode, whether <lb/>
            it were the simple Æolian, the varied Asian, the plaintive <lb/>
            Lydian, the religious Phrygian, or the warlike Dorian. Being <lb/>
             <pb n="377"/>
            thus a most distinguished flutist, he used to say, that nothing <lb/>
            so vexed and fretted his mind, as, that the horn-players at fune­ <lb/>
            rals were called flutists. But he would have patiently endured <lb/>
            this community of names if he had seen mimes. Then he <lb/>
            would have seen some commanding, others suffering blows, <lb/>
            and all dressed nearly alike in purple. So also if he saw our <lb/>
            games: for there too he would see a man preside, a man fight. <lb/>
            He would see the toga employed both for the registering of a <lb/>
            vow and for a funeral. Likewise he would see corpses covered, <lb/>
            and philosophers clad with a pallium.</p>

          <p>The Indians are a populous nation of vast extent of terri. <lb/>
            tory, situated far from us to the East, near the reflux of the <lb/>
            ocean and the rising of the sun, under the first beams of the <lb/>
            stars, and at the extreme verge of the earth, beyond the learned <lb/>
            Egyptians, and the superstitious Jews, and the mercantile Na- <lb/>
            bathæans, and the flowing robed Arsacidæ, and the Ityræans, <lb/>
            poor in crops, and the Arabians rich in perfumes. Now I do <lb/>
            not so much admire the heaps of ivory of these Indians, their <lb/>
            harvests of pepper, their bales of cinnamon, their tempered <lb/>
            steel, their mines of silver, and their golden streams; nor that <lb/>
            among them the Ganges, the greatest of all rivers, <lb/>
            Rolls like a monarch on his course, and pours <lb/>
            His eastern waters through a hundred streams, <lb/>
            Mingling with ocean by a hundred mouths; <lb/>
            nor that those Indians, though. situated at the dawn of day, <lb/>
            are yet of the colour of night; nor that among them immense <lb/>
            dragons fight with enormous elephants, with parity of danger, <lb/>
            to their mutual destruction; for they hold them enwrapped in <lb/>
            their slippery folds, so that when the elephants cannot dis­ <lb/>
            engage their legs, or in any way extricate themselves from the <lb/>
             <pb n="378"/>
            scaly bonds of the tenacious dragons, they are forced to seek <lb/>
            revenge from the fall of their own bulk, and to crush their <lb/>
            'captors by the mass of their bodies. There are among them <lb/>
            also various kinds of inhabitants. I will rather speak of the <lb/>
            marvellous things of men than of those of nature. There is <lb/>
            among them a race who know nothing but how to tend cattle ; <lb/>
            whence they are called neatherds. There are races clever in <lb/>
            trafficking with merchandise, and others stout in fight, whether <lb/>
            with arrows or hand-to-hand with swords. There is also <lb/>
            among them a pre-eminent race called Gymnosophists. These <lb/>
            I exceedingly admire, for they are men skilled not in propa­ <lb/>
            gating the vine, nor in grafting trees, nor in tilling the <lb/>
            ground. They know not how to cultivate the fields, or to wash <lb/>
            gold, or to break horses, or to tame bulls, or to shear or feed <lb/>
            sheep or goats. What is it then ? They know one thing in­ <lb/>
            stead of all these. They cultivate wisdom, both the aged pro­ <lb/>
            fessors and the young students. Nothing do I so much applaud <lb/>
            in them as that they hate torpor of mind and sloth. Accordingly, <lb/>
            when the table is laid, before the meal is served up, all the <lb/>
            young men assemble round it from their several places and <lb/>
            occupations, and the masters enquire what good thing each has <lb/>
            done that day since sunrise. Thereupon one relates that hav­ <lb/>
            ing been chosen arbitrator between two, he has allayed their <lb/>
            quarrel, restored good will, cleared up suspicion, and changed <lb/>
            them from enemies to friends. Another states that he has <lb/>
            obeyed some command or another of his parents; and another, <lb/>
            that he has found out something by his own reflection, or from <lb/>
            another's teaching. In short, all tell their tale. He who has <lb/>
            no cause to offer why he should dine, is turned out of doors, <lb/>
            and sent about his business without a dinner.</p>

          <p>It was the will of Alexander, that moot excellent of all <lb/>
            kings, who received the surname of the Great for his achieve­ <lb/>
            ments, that he who had attained that singular glory, should <lb/>
            never be named without praise. For he alone, since the begin­ <lb/>
            ning of time, as far as human memory extends, having pos­ <lb/>
            sessed himself invincibly of the dominion of. the world, was <lb/>
            greater than his fortune, and both induced its vast successes <lb/>
            by his valour, and equalled them by his merits, and surpassed <lb/>
            them by his superior greatness. He alone was so illustrious <lb/>
             <pb n="379"/>
            beyond all rivalry, that no one can dare to hope for his excel­ <lb/>
            lence or covet his fortune. You would be wearied with ad­ <lb/>
            miring the lofty deeds of that great Alexander, whether those <lb/>
            which he achieved in war, or those which he wisely accom­ <lb/>
            plished in peace;' all which, my Clemens, the most learned <lb/>
            and sweetest of poets, has undertaken to illustrate in a very <lb/>
            beautiful poem. Now this is a most signal fact respecting <lb/>
            Alexander,.that in order to have his image descend the more <lb/>
            authentically to posterity, he would not allow it to be vulgar­ <lb/>
            ised by many artists, but commanded throughout all his em­ <lb/>
            pire, that no one should presumptuously make the king's like­ <lb/>
            ness in brass, or in painting, or with the graver; but that <lb/>
            Polycletus alone should mould it in brass, Apelles alone deli­ <lb/>
            neate it in colours, Pyrgoteles alone should elaborate it with <lb/>
            the graver. Besides these three artists, far the most eminent <lb/>
            in their several kinds, if any other was found to have put his <lb/>
            hands to the king's most sacred image, he should be punished <lb/>
            just as one who had committed sacrilege. The consequence <lb/>
            of that fear imposed on all was, that Alexander was presented <lb/>
            with singular excellence in all his likenesses; so that in all <lb/>
            statues, pictures, and engraved gems, he appears with the <lb/>
            same vigorous aspect of a most intrepid warrior, the same <lb/>
            genius of a mighty hero, the same beauty and freshness of <lb/>
            youth, the same noble expansion of forehead. Now I would <lb/>
            that in like manner, it were a valid decree of philosophy that <lb/>
            no one should presumptuously attempt its likeness; that a few <lb/>
            good artists, and those soundly instructed, should consider the <lb/>
            study of philosophy in every way, and that no rude, squalid, <lb/>
            ignorant pretenders should imitate philosophers as far as re­ <lb/>
            gards their garb, and should disgrace that royal science which <lb/>
            was devised both for speaking well and living well, by talk­ <lb/>
            ing ill and living no better. Both which things are indeed <lb/>
            very easy; for what can be easier than rabidness of tongue and <lb/>
            baseness of conduct, the former from contempt of others, the <lb/>
            latter from self contempt ? For to conduct oneself basely is <lb/>
            self-contempt; to vilify others barbarously, is insolence to­ <lb/>
            wards one's hearers. Does he not insult you in the highest <lb/>
            degree who supposes you to delight in slanders against any <lb/>
            good man; who thinks you do not understand bad and vicious <lb/>
            words, or that if you understand, you like them ? Where is <lb/>
            the clown, the porter, or the pothouse sot, so silly that if <lb/>
             <pb n="380"/>

          <p>For he owes more to you than to his dignity, although that <lb/>
            is not common to him with others. For out of countless men <lb/>
            there are but few senators, and of senators few are of noble <lb/>
            birth ; and of those consular men few are good, and of those <lb/>
            good, moreover, few are learned. But to speak only of his <lb/>

            the proconsul, and he too is seen there dressed in the toga; <lb/>
            and indeed he stands there a long while, or he walks about, <lb/>
            or he bawls often with all his might; but the proconsol him­ <lb/>
            self speaks in a moderate tone, rarely, and in a sitting pos­ <lb/>
            ture, and he generally reads from a tablet. For the crier's <lb/>
            garrulous voice is the function of his office; but the tablet <lb/>
            is the proconsol's sentence, which when once read, cannot be <lb/>
            lengthened or shortened by a single letter, but as soon as it is <lb/>
            pronounced, it is inserted in the registry of the province. I, <lb/>
            in my degree, suffer something like this in my studies. For <lb/>
            whatever I have delivered to you is immediately taken up and <lb/>
            recited, nor is it free to me to recall any part of it, or to <lb/>
            change or correct it in any respect. Wherefore, I must be <lb/>
            the more scrupulous in speaking, and that too not in one kind <lb/>
            of matter only. For there are extant more works of mine in <lb/>
            the Muses than of Hippias in art. What that means, give me <lb/>
            your attention, and I will diligently and accurately set forth.</p>
          <p>This Hippias was one of the sophists, superior to all in the <lb/>
            number of the arts he knew, inferior to none in eloquence. <lb/>
            He was contemporary with Socrates, a native of Elis, of what <lb/>
            family is not known. His glory was great, his fortune small; <lb/>
            but his genius was great, his memory excellent, his studies <lb/>
            various, his rivals many. This Hippias came once to Pisa to <lb/>
            the Olympic games, where he was not less remarkable for the <lb/>
            ornaments he wore than for the fact that he had wrought <lb/>
            them himself. Of all those things he had with him he had <lb/>
            purchased not one, but had made them with his own hands; <lb/>
            the garments in which he was clad, the shoes on his feet, and <lb/>
            everything he carried on his person. For clothing he had an <lb/>
            inner tunic of very fine texture, of triple thread, and double <lb/>
            purple dye. He had wrought it single-handed at home. He <lb/>
            was girt with a belt adorned with a sort of Babylonian pic­ <lb/>
            ture of admirable colours. Nor had any one helped him in <lb/>
            that work. His outer covering was a white cloak, which <lb/>
            also is known to have been his own handiwork. Also he <note type="footnote"> * Cloaked lies.]—Impostors who are bearded and cloaked like philo­ <lb/>
            sophers. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="382"/>
            had put together the soles of his own foot gear; and as for the <lb/>
            gold ring on his left hand, bearing a most skilfully cut seal <lb/>
            which he often exhibited, he himself had rounded the ring, <lb/>
            and had closed the pallet, and engraved the gem. I have not <lb/>
            yet told all he did. For I shall not be loth to relate what he <lb/>
            was not ashamed to display, who asserted in a large assembly <lb/>
            that he had also made himself an oil flask which he carried <lb/>
            about him, of a lenticular form, of a rounded outline and <lb/>
            small convexity; and with it a neat little scraper to be used <lb/>
            in the bath, with a convenient handle and tubulated face, so <lb/>
            that it might be held steadily in the hand, and that the sweat <lb/>
            might flow out of it in a stream. Who will not extol a man <lb/>
            skilled in so many arts; illustrious for such manifold know­ <lb/>
            ledge ; a Dædalus in the use of so many tools ? Certainly, I <lb/>
            admire Hippias, but I would rather rival the fecundity of his <lb/>
            genius in matters of learning, than in multitudinous appliances <lb/>
            for personal use.</p>
          <p>I confess, indeed, that I am not expert in handicraft arts; <lb/>
            that I buy my garments at the clothier's—these shoes at the <lb/>
            shoe-maker's; that I wear no ring, and hold gems and gold of <lb/>
            no more account than lead and pebbles ; that I buy a scraper, a <lb/>
            flask, and other bath utensils at the shops. I am far from <lb/>
            denying that I do not know how to use the loom, or the awl, <lb/>
            or the file, or the lathe, or any such implements; instead of <lb/>
            these, I confess I prefer to compose with a writing reed, poems <lb/>
            of all kinds adapted to the laurel branch,* the lyre, the sock, <lb/>
            the buskin; likewise satires and enigmas; likewise various <lb/>
            histories; as, also, orations praised by the eloquent, and dia­ <lb/>
            logues praised by philosophers; and to compose these and such <lb/>
            like works, both in Greek and Latin, with two-fold study, with <lb/>
            equal diligence and in similar style. These things I would, <lb/>
            indeed, Proconsul, excellent man, that I could lay before you <lb/>
            not singly and piece-meal, but collectively in one heap, and <lb/>
            enjoy your honourable testimony regarding all my literary <lb/>
            labours. It is not, indeed, from penury of fame that I de­ <lb/>
            sire this, for fame has long subsisted for me, bright and un­ <lb/>
            broken among all your predecessors,' down to yourself; but <lb/>
            because by no one am I more desirous of being esteemed than <note type="footnote"> * The laurel branch.) Those who recited poems in public or at private <lb/>
            entertainments, carried a branch of laurel or myrtle in their hands, whence <lb/>
            they were called by the Greeks <foreign xml:lang="grc">ρ́αβδωδοὶ</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">ειχωδοι</foreign>. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="383"/>
            by him which I justly esteem above all others. For it is a <lb/>
            law of nature that whom you praise, him you also love; and <lb/>
            moreover, whom you love, by him you would wish to be praised. <lb/>
            Now I profess myself one who prizes you dearly, being bound <lb/>
            to you by no private, but by all manner of public favours. I <lb/>
            have, indeed, obtained nothing from you, for nothing have I <lb/>
            asked. But philosophy has taught me to love not only kind­ <lb/>
            ness but injury, and rather to do homage to reason than to <lb/>
            seek my own advantage, and to prefer public expediency to <lb/>
            my own. Hence, whilst the majority love the beneficial effects <lb/>
            of your goodness, I love its principle. And this I have begun <lb/>
            to do whilst considering your conduct in the affairs of the inha­ <lb/>
            bitants of this province, for which they ought to love you <lb/>
            intensely: such of them as have felt it in their own persons, <lb/>
            for sake of the benefit they have received; such as have not <lb/>
            personally experienced it for sake of the example. For you <lb/>
            have benefited many individually, and all by your example. <lb/>
            For who does not delight to learn from you by what adjust­ <lb/>
            ment may be acquired that pleasant gravity of yours, that <lb/>
            mild austerity, that placid firmness, that gracious vigour of <lb/>
            mind. Never, to my knowledge, did the province of Africa <lb/>
            ever revere more, and fear less any proconsul; in no year of <lb/>
            administration but yours, had shame more power than fear <lb/>
            towards restraining offences. No one but you has used the <lb/>
            like power so often to serve, so seldom to terrify. No one has <lb/>
            brought with him a son more resembling himself in virtue. <lb/>
            Hence, no proconsul has remained longer in Carthage. For at <lb/>
            the time you made a tour of the province, while Honorinus <lb/>
            remained with us, we did not feel your absence so much as <lb/>
            rather to wish you back. There is in the son the equity of <lb/>
            the father, in the youth the prudence of the old man, in the <lb/>
            legate the personal weight of the consul. So thoroughly does <lb/>
            he copy and reflect all your good qualities, that truly, such ex­ <lb/>
            cellence would be more worthy of admiration in the young <lb/>
            man than in you, were it not that you had imparted it to him. <lb/>
            Would that we might always enjoy it! What to us are these <lb/>
            changes of proconsuls ? What these brief years and rapid <lb/>
            months ? 0 swift days of good men ! 0 quickly lapsing tenure <lb/>
            of the best governors! Our whole province, Severianus, now <lb/>
            grieves to lose you. But Honorinus is called by his own worth <lb/>
            to the prætorship, and the favour of the Cæsars is preparing <lb/>
             <pb n="384"/>
            him for the consulship; our love beholds him, at present; and <lb/>
            the hope of Carthage promises for the future, relying on the <lb/>
            sole consolation of your example, that he who leaves us a <lb/>
            legate, soon returns to us as proconsul.</p>

          <p>The parrot is a bird of India, in form a little less than the <lb/>
            dove; but its colour is not that of the dove, for it is not <lb/>
            white, nor blackish, or yellowish on either side, or variegated; <lb/>
            but the parrot's colour is green both in its inner down and <lb/>
            its outer feathers, except that it is varied in the neck alone. <note type="footnote"> * Spi, &amp;c.]—From the Phœnissæ of L. Attius or Accius. </note><note type="footnote"> + Unl ky darnel, —FromVirgil, Eclogue V. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="385"/>
            For its neck is encompassed and girded with a red circle, <lb/>
            like a gold necklace, and of equal splendour. Its beak is <lb/>
            hard in the highest degree. When it swoops down from its <lb/>
            highest flight upon a rock, it lights there upon its beak, and <lb/>
            fixes itself as with an anchor. Its head too, is as hard as its <lb/>
            beak. When it is compelled to imitate our speech, its head is <lb/>
            beaten with a little iron rod, to make it attend to the commands <lb/>
            of its master. This is the ferula beneath which it learns. Its <lb/>
            schooling begins when it is but a chick, and continues until its <lb/>
            second year, as long as its mouth is easy to mould, and its <lb/>
            tongue is pliable. If taken old, it is indocile and forgetful. <lb/>
            But that kind of parrot is apter to learn human speech which <lb/>
            feeds on nuts, and which has feet with five toes like man; for <lb/>
            all parrots have not that characteristic; but it is common to <lb/>
            them all to have the tongue broader than that of other birds, <lb/>
            whereby they more easily articulate human words, as having <lb/>
            a more expanded plectrum and palate. But what it has learned <lb/>
            it sings, or rather speaks, like us, so that if you heard it, you <lb/>
            would suppose it was the voice of a man; but if you saw it, <lb/>
            you would say it was not speaking, but trying to do so. Now <lb/>
            both the crow and the parrot pronounce only what they have <lb/>
            been taught. If you teach a parrot ribaldry, he will be a <lb/>
            ribald, screaming scurrility day and night. This is its song; <lb/>
            this it considers warbling. When it has run through all the <lb/>
            scurrilous phrases it has learned, it begins the same strain over <lb/>
            again. If you would be free from its ribaldry, you must cut out <lb/>
            its tongue, or at once send it back to its woods.</p>

          <p>For philosophy has not bestowed on me that kind of speech, <lb/>
            as nature has endowed some birds with a brief and periodical <lb/>
            song, a morning song to swallows, a mid-day to cicalas, an after­ <lb/>
            noon to buzzards, an evening to screech owls, a nocturnal to <lb/>
            homed owls, a peep of day song to cocks. All these creatures <lb/>
            differ from each other in the period and the manner of their <lb/>
            song; the cocks sing with an awakening strain, the homed owls <lb/>
            moan, the screech owls are querulous, the buzzards have inflected <lb/>
            notes, the cicalas are obstreperous, the swallows twitter shrilly. <lb/>
            But the discourse of the philosopher is practised at all seasons, <lb/>
            and is reverend to hear, useful to understand, and omnisonant <lb/>

          <p>Crates, the follower of Diogenes, who was adored like a <lb/>
            domestic Lar by the Athenians of his time, was one against <lb/>
            whom no door was ever shut; nor had any father of a family <lb/>
            a secret so profound as not to admit the seasonable interposi­ <lb/>
            tion of Crates, the analyser and arbitrator of all disputes and <lb/>
            altercations between relations. As the poets relate that Hercules <lb/>
            formerly quelled by his valour horrid monsters, both human and <lb/>
            brute, so was that philosopher a Hercules against anger and <lb/>
            envy, avarice and lust, and other monsters and enormities of <lb/>
            the human mind. All these pests he drove out from the minds <lb/>
            of men, purged families of them, and quelled malevolence. <lb/>
            He, too, was half naked, and notable for his club; he was <lb/>
            likewise a native of Thebes, whence Hercules is known to <lb/>
            have derived his birth. Before he became downright Crates, <lb/>
            he was numbered among the nobles of Thebes: his family <lb/>
            was one of the best, his household numerous, his dwelling <lb/>
            adorned with an ample vestibule. He himself was well <lb/>
            dressed, and well endowed with lands. Afterwards he came <lb/>
            to understand that no security was bequeathed him with his <lb/>
            ' wealth that he should enjoy it all his life; that all things <lb/>
            are unstable and insecure ; that all the riches under the <lb/>
            sky avail nothing towards a happy life. When Crates <lb/>
            learned these and similar truths, partly from Diogenes and <lb/>
            partly from his own reflection, he at last went out into the <lb/>
            forum, and threw down his wealth like a load of dung, more <lb/>
            fatiguing than useful. Then when a great crowd had as­ <lb/>
            sembled, he cried out, "Crates manumits Crates." Thence­ <lb/>
            forth he lived happily all his days, not only without servants, <lb/>
            but also bare and disencumbered of every thing. And so <lb/>
            much was he sought after, that a noble virgin, scorning younger <lb/>
            wooers, voluntarily chose him for her own. And when Crates <lb/>
            uncovered his shoulders and showed how he was hunchbacked, <lb/>
            and laid his wallet and staff and his cloak on the ground, tell­ <lb/>
            ing her that these were his worldly gear, and that such as she <lb/>
            had seen was his beauty, and bidding her therefore ponder <lb/>
            carefully, that she might not find reason to complain after­ <lb/>
            wards, Hipparche still accepted the proposed conditions. She <lb/>
            replied that she had already sufficiently considered the matter; <lb/>
            that she could nowhere in the world find a richer or a hand- <lb/>
             <pb n="387"/>
            somer husband; and he might therefore take her where he <lb/>
            pleased. The cynic led her to the portico, and there lay with <lb/>
            her in a frequented spot, publicly in broad daylight; and he <lb/>
            would have deflowered her in all men's sight, prepared as <lb/>
            she was to bear it with equal indifference, had not Zeno con­ <lb/>
            cealed his master from the gaze of the surrounding throng, <lb/>
            by hanging his tattered cloak before him.</p>

          <p>Samos is an island of moderate extent in the Icarian Sea, <lb/>
            opposite Miletus, situated to the westward of it, and separated <lb/>
            from it by no great breadth of sea. Passing with easy sail <lb/>
            from one to the other, the second day puts you in port. The <lb/>
            soil of the island is inapt for corn, unfit for the plough, more <lb/>
            productive of olives, nor is it dug by the vinegrower or the <lb/>
            gardener. Its whole cultivation consists in hoeing and plants <lb/>
            ing rows of olives, from the produce of which the island is <lb/>
            more fructiferous than frugiferous.* Furthermore, it abounds <lb/>
            in inhabitants, and is much frequented by strangers. It has <lb/>
            a town by no means corresponding to its reputation; but that <lb/>
            it was once large is shown by the ruins of walls in many <lb/>
            places. There stands the most celebrated temple of JUDO. It <lb/>
            stands near the sea-shore, at a distance, if I remember rightly, <lb/>
            of not more than twenty stadia from the town. It contains a <lb/>
            most opulent shrine of the goddess, and a vast quantity of <lb/>
            silver in platters, mirrors, cups, and such like utensils. There <lb/>
            is also a great amount of bronze, in various figures, of very <lb/>
            ancient and handsome workmanship. For instance, there is <lb/>
            before the altar a statue of Bathyllus, dedicated by the tyrant <lb/>
            Polycrates, than which I do not think I have seen anything <lb/>
            more exquisite. Some erroneously suppose it to be the statue <lb/>
            of Pythagoras. It is a youth of remarkable beauty, with hair <lb/>
            parted on the forehead, and falling evenly on the cheeks; but <lb/>
            behind the hair is longer, and covers the neck, which shines <lb/>
            through them as far as the verge of the shoulders. The neck <lb/>
            is plump, the cheeks round and beardless, and there is a little <lb/>
            dimple in the chin; the costume is exactly that of a harper ; <lb/>
            he looks towards the goddess like one who is singing; he <note type="footnote"> * Fructiferous than frugiferous.]—It abounds more in fruit (fructus) <lb/>
            than in corn and garden stuff (fruges). This is an example of that <lb/>
            jingling of words in which Apuleius so inordinately delights. </note> <note type="footnote"> C C 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="388"/>
            wears a figured and coloured tunic, flowing down to his feet, <lb/>
            with a zone in the Greek fashion; and a chlamys covering <lb/>
            both arms to the wrists. The other histrionic ornaments <lb/>
            hang upon the figure. The lyre is suspended from a short en­ <lb/>
            graved baldrick. The hands are delicate; the left is stretched <lb/>
            out, and touches the strings with its spread fingers; the right <lb/>
            applies the plectrum to the lyre, as if ready to strike the chords <lb/>
            when the voice has paused in singing. Meanwhile he seems <lb/>
            to pour out his song from his rounded mouth, with lips inten­ <lb/>
            tionally half opened. Now this is the statue of a certain <lb/>
            youth beloved by Polycrates, the tyrant, whom Anacreon, the <lb/>
            Teian, celebrates in song for friendship's sake. But it is far <lb/>
            from being the statue of Pythagoras, the philosopher.</p>
          <p>The latter was by birth a Samian, most remarkable for beauty, <lb/>
            deeply versed in minstrelsy and all kinds of music, and <lb/>
            he lived about the time when Polycrates ruled in Samos. <lb/>
            But the philosopher was by no means a favourite with the <lb/>
            tyrant. Just after the latter had began to rule, Pythagoras <lb/>
            fled privily from the island, having lately lost his father <lb/>
            Mnesarchus, whom I find to have been an artist, and to have <lb/>
            acquired reputation rather than wealth, by very cleverly en­ <lb/>
            graving gems. Some say that Pythagoras was at that time <lb/>
            conveyed to Egypt among the captives of king Cambyses, and <lb/>
            that he had for teachers the Persian magi, and especially Zo­ <lb/>
            roaster, the adept in every divine mystery; and that he was <lb/>
            afterwards received by a certain Gillus, a leading man among <lb/>
            the inhabitants of Crotona. But the more generally received <lb/>
            story is, that he went of his own accord to acquire the learn­ <lb/>
            ing of Egypt, and that he was there taught by the priests the <lb/>
            incredible powers of ceremonies, the wonderful commutations <lb/>
            of numbers, and the most ingenious figures of geometry; but <lb/>
            that not satisfied with these mental accomplishments, he <lb/>
            afterwards visited the Chaldæans and the Brahmins, and <lb/>
            among the latter the Gymnosophists. The Chaldæans taught <lb/>
            him the stars, the definite orbits of the planets, and the various <lb/>
            effects of both kinds of stars upon the nativity of men; as also, <lb/>
            for much money, the remedies for human use derived from the <lb/>
            earth, and the air, and the sea. But the Brahmins taught <lb/>
            him the greater part of his philosophy: what are the rules <lb/>
            and principles of the understanding; what the functions of <lb/>
            the body; how many are the faculties of the soul, how many <lb/>
             <pb n="389"/>
            the mutations of life; what torments or rewards devolve upon <lb/>
            the souls of the dead according to their respective deserts. <lb/>
            Moreover, there was Pherecydes, a native of the island of <lb/>
            Syros, who was the first who ventured to reject the fetters of <lb/>
            verse, and to write in prose: him, too, Pythagoras waited on <lb/>
            as another master, and when turned into a scab of creeping <lb/>
            things by the corruption of a most horrible disease, he buried <lb/>
            him religiously. He is said also to have discussed natural <lb/>
            science under Anaximander, the Milesian; to have followed <lb/>
            for instruction Epimenides, of Crete, the illustrious seer and <lb/>
            poet; and likewise Leodamas, the disciple of Creophylus, which <lb/>
            latter is said to have been the host of the poet Homer, and his <lb/>
            imitator in song.</p>
          <p>Instructed by so many masters, having drunk of so many <lb/>
            various fountains of knowledge all over the world, this man of <lb/>
            surpassingly mighty genius, and of more than human grandeur <lb/>
            of soul, the first namer and founder of philosophy, taught his <lb/>
            disciples nothing in the first place but to be silent. With <lb/>
            him the first study imposed upon the future sage was to hold <lb/>
            his tongue altogether, and as for the words which poets call <lb/>
            winged, to pluck their plumes and shut them up within the <lb/>
            walls of his white teeth. This was, I say, absolutely the <lb/>
            first rudiment of wisdom, to learn to think, and unlearn to <lb/>
            prate. But they did not abstain from speaking all their lives <lb/>
            long, nor did all follow their master in silence during an <lb/>
            equally long period; but silence observed during a short space <lb/>
            of time was thought enough for men of graver disposition, <lb/>
            whilst the more talkative were punished by a silence of five <lb/>
            years, their voice being sent, as it were, into exile. Now our <lb/>
            master, Plato, imitates Pythagoras, differing in little or no de­ <lb/>
            gree from his sect. I, too, among a great many men, having <lb/>
            been admitted into his sect by my teachers, have learned both <lb/>
            these things in academic meditations : to speak with all my <lb/>
            might when speech is required ; and when silence is required, <lb/>
            to hold my tongue willingly. Through this moderation I <lb/>
            think I have obtained credit from all your predecessors, not <lb/>
            less for my opportune silence, than for my timely speaking.</p>

          </ab>
          <p>Before I begin, noblemen of Africa, to thank you for the <lb/>
            statue which you did me the honour to propose during my pre­ <lb/>
             <pb n="390"/>
            sence here, and which you kindly decreed to erect to me during <lb/>
            my absence, I wish first to acquaint you with the reason why <lb/>
            I have not been seen by this assembly for a good many days, <lb/>
            having betaken myself to the Persian waters, so pleasant to <lb/>
            healthy bathers, and so curative to the sick. For I have <lb/>
            made it my resolution thus to submit the whole course of my <lb/>
            time to your approval, to whom I have perpetually dedicated <lb/>
            myself. Never will I do anything, great or small, of which I <lb/>
            will not make you cognizant and judges. That you may <lb/>
            know, therefore, why I suddenly disappeared from the sight <lb/>
            of this your illustrious assemblage, I will relate an almost <lb/>
            parallel case of the comic writer, Philemon, as an example of <lb/>
            what unforeseen dangers suddenly befal men. You who know <lb/>
            enough of his genius, hear a few words about his death. Do <lb/>
            you wish me to say a few words also about his genius ? This <lb/>
            Philemon was a poet, and a writer of the middle comedy. He <lb/>
            produced pieces for the stage along with Menander, and con­ <lb/>
            tended with him, being perhaps inferior to him, but at all <lb/>
            events his rival. For that he was often victorious over him is <lb/>
            a shameful thing to tell. Nevertheless, we find in him much <lb/>
            wit; plots ingeniously involved; recognitions clearly made <lb/>
            out; personages suited to the matter; phrases appropriate, to <lb/>
            each character; gaieties not beneath the sock; gravities not <lb/>
            quite up to the buskin. Impurities are rare in his works, <lb/>
            and amours are admitted as errors. Nevertheless, you find in <lb/>
            him the perjured pimp, the hot lover, the cunning slave, the <lb/>
            wheedling mistress, the peremptory wife, the indulgent mo­ <lb/>
            ther, the scolding uncle, the helpful friend, and the fighting <lb/>
            soldier, together with various parasites, and stingy parents, <lb/>
            and wanton harlots.</p>
          <p>Distinguished by these merits as a comic writer, it hap­ <lb/>
            pened that he recited part of a play he had recently com­ <lb/>
            posed. When he had come to the third act, and was exciting <lb/>
            those pleasant emotions which comedy delights in, a sudden <lb/>
            shower of rain coming on, as very lately happened to myself <lb/>
            when speaking before you, compelled him to dismiss his audi­ <lb/>
            ence and suspend his reading. But many persons calling for <lb/>
            the remainder, he promised that he would deliver it on the <lb/>
            following day without interruption. Next day, accordingly, a <lb/>
            great concourse assembled, extremely eager for what was to <lb/>
            come, and every one took the nearest seat he could find oppo­ <lb/>
             <pb n="391"/>
            site the reader's place. The late comer nodded to his friends, <lb/>
            who found sitting room for him. The whole theatre being <lb/>
            crammed, the pressure was great, and they began to complain <lb/>
            of each other. All those who were so late as to be excluded <lb/>
            from the benches were pitied. Those who had not been pre­ <lb/>
            sent at the first day's reading enquired what had then been de­ <lb/>
            livered ; those who had been. present recalled to mind what they <lb/>
            had heard, and knowing all that had gone before, began to look <lb/>
            for what was to come. Meanwhile the day was passing away, <lb/>
            and Philemon did not keep his appointment. Some murmured <lb/>
            at the poet's delay, many defended him. But when the audi­ <lb/>
            ence had waited an unreasonable time and no Philemon ap­ <lb/>
            peared, some of the readiest were sent to fetch him, and found <lb/>
            him dead in his bed. He had just stiffened after giving up <lb/>
            the ghost, and lay resting on his elbow on the bed as if think­ <lb/>
            ing. His hand was still inserted in the scroll; his face was <lb/>
            turned toward the book which he held straight before him; <lb/>
            but he was already senseless, unconscious of the book, and re­ <lb/>
            gardless of his audience. Those who had entered stood still <lb/>
            awhile, struck with wonder at so unexpected an event, so <lb/>
            beautiful a death. They then returned and announced to the <lb/>
            people that Philemon, who was expected to finish his fictitious <lb/>
            plot in the theatre, had concluded the real comedy at home. <lb/>
            He had said to human affairs, 11 Farewell and applaud," but <lb/>
            to his friends, lament and wail; that shower of yesterday had <lb/>
            boded him tears; his comedy had arrived sooner at the fune­ <lb/>
            ral than the nuptial torch. And since this excellent poet had <lb/>
            made his exit from life, it was meet that the audience should <lb/>
            proceed straightway to his obsequies; that his bones should <lb/>
            now be collected, and by and by his poems.</p>
          <p>I learned long ago, that these facts occurred as I have re­ <lb/>
            lated ; but I have been reminded of them to-day by my own <lb/>
            mischance. For, as you remember, when my recitation was <lb/>
            interrupted by the rain, I postponed it at your desire to the <lb/>
            following day; and certainly after Philemon's example; for <lb/>
            the very same day I so violently sprained my ankle in the <lb/>
            palæstra, that I all but broke off the joint from the leg. It <lb/>
            was put out of place, however, and is still infirm from the dis­ <lb/>
            location ; and when I reduced it at first with great force, I <lb/>
            sweated profusely and had long rigors. Then I suffered <lb/>
            acute pain of the intestines, which hardly ceased until its vio­ <lb/>
             <pb n="392"/>
            lence had destroyed me, and compelled me, after the manner <lb/>
            of Philemon, to be dead before I had read; to finish what was <lb/>
            written for me in the book of fate sooner than what I had <lb/>
            written; to end my life sooner than my history. As soon, <lb/>
            then, as I had recovered the power of walking at the Persian <lb/>
            waters, by their mild temperature and their no less useful <lb/>
            than soothing warmth, not, indeed, so as to be able to tread <lb/>
            firmly, but as much as seemed to me sufficient for my haste to <lb/>
            return to you, I came to perform what I had promised; whilst <lb/>
            you in the meantime had, by your kindness, not only taken <lb/>
            away my lameness, but even added speed to my feet.</p>
          <p>Had I not good cause to hasten, that I might return you <lb/>
            many thanks for that honour for which I had not petitioned <lb/>
            you ? Not but that the grandeur of Carthage is worthy that <lb/>
            even a philosopher should sue to it for honours; but that your <lb/>
            kindness should be whole and unimpaired, if no solicitation of <lb/>
            mine detracted from its spontaneous grace. For neither does <lb/>
            he who prays buy the object of his prayers for a cheap consi­ <lb/>
            deration, nor does he who is solicited accept a small price, so <lb/>
            that you would rather buy all kinds of commodities than beg <lb/>
            for them. This, I think, is especially to be considered a <lb/>
            matter of honour: he who obtains with much pains and solici­ <lb/>
            tation on his own part, owes one debt of gratitude to himself <lb/>
            for as much as he has succeeded in his suit; but he who has <lb/>
            received it without the trouble of a canvass, owes a double <lb/>
            debt of gratitude to the grantors; both because he has not <lb/>
            sought, and he has obtained. I therefore owe you twofold <lb/>
            thanks, nay, manifold thanks, as I shall always and every­ <lb/>
            where declare. But now for the present time I will publicly <lb/>
            profess it, as is my wont, in this book composed by me, on ac­ <lb/>
            count of this honour. For there is a certain method in which <lb/>
            a philosopher ought to return thanks for a statue publicly de­ <lb/>
            creed to him : from that method that book will diverge little <lb/>
            which the distinguished honour of Strabo Æmilianus demands, <lb/>
            a book which I think I can suitably compose, if you will join <lb/>
            in extolling him to-day with me. For he so excels in studies, <lb/>
            that he is much more illustrious by his own genius than by <lb/>
            his father's consulship.</p>
          <p>In what words, Emilianus Strabo, of all men who have <lb/>
            been, or are, or will be in Numantia, most illustrious amongst <lb/>
            the best, and best among the most illustrious, and most learned <lb/>
             <pb n="393"/>
            among both; in what words shall I return thanks in my dis­ <lb/>
            course for this disposition of yours towards me r In what <lb/>
            worthy manner I can extol your honourable good-will, with <lb/>
            what remuneration of speech I can match the high praise of <lb/>
            this act of yours, by Hercules! I am yet at a loss to know; <lb/>
            but I will diligently seek and strive to discover, <lb/>
            " Whilst conscious of myself, whilt spirit rules this frame." * <lb/>
            For at present, I will not deny it, joy overpowers my eloquence, <lb/>
            and thought is hindered by pleasure, and my mind, engrossed <lb/>
            with delight, is at present more inclined to exult than to extol. <lb/>
            What shall I do ? I wish to appear grateful, but joy will not <lb/>
            leave me free to express gratitude. Let no one, let no one of <lb/>
            those morose censors vituperate me because I do not less de­ <lb/>
            serve than I appreciate this honour; because I exult in so <lb/>
            great an honour conferred on me by a most illustrious and <lb/>
            erudite man. A consular man, to whom it is a high honour <lb/>
            to be merely known, has borne testimony for me in the equally <lb/>
            illustrious and most benign senate of Carthage. He has also <lb/>
            been in a manner my panegyrist before the chief men of <lb/>
            Africa. For as I learn, in a memorial he sent in the day <lb/>
            before yesterday, in which he asked for a frequented site for <lb/>
            the erection of my statue, he mentioned in the first place the <lb/>
            rights of friendship honestly cemented between us through <lb/>
            our companionship in study under the same masters; and then <lb/>
            he enumerated all my vows for his successive advancement in <lb/>
            public honours. That is in itself a first kindness, that he <lb/>
            records his having been my fellow-student. And this is <lb/>
            another, that a man of his eminence declares that he is be­ <lb/>
            loved reciprocally by me. Moreover, he has mentioned that <lb/>
            statues and other honours have been decreed to me in other <lb/>
            countries and cities. What can be added to these encomiums <lb/>
            by a man of consular dignity? Nay, he proved from the <lb/>
            priesthood I have taken upon me, that the highest honour in <lb/>
            Carthage was before me. This is a capital service he has con­ <lb/>
            ferred on me, and far excelling the rest, that he, a most influ­ <lb/>
            ential witness, commends me to you even by his own suffrage. <lb/>
            Finally, he has promised that he will erect a statue to me in <lb/>
            Carthage at his own expense, he to whom all provinces delight <lb/>
            every where to erect equestrian statues, with chariots of four <note type="footnote"> * Whilst conscious, &amp;c.]—A line from Virgil, Æneid, Book iv. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="394"/>
            and of six horses. What more, then, is wanting to the base <lb/>
            and summit of my honour, to the culmination of may glory ? <lb/>
            Nay, what more is there behind ? Æmilianus Strabo, a con­ <lb/>
            sular man, soon by universal consent to be proconsul, pro­ <lb/>
            nounced his opinion concerning the honours to be paid to me <lb/>
            in the senate of the Carthaginians: all followed his lead. <lb/>
            Does not this seem to you tantamount to a decree of the <lb/>
            senate ? What ? that all the Carthaginians who were present <lb/>
            in that most august senate, so willingly appointed a place for <lb/>
            my statue as to make it apparent, as I hope, that they only <lb/>
            postponed to the next senate a motion for another statue to <lb/>
            me, in order that, saving the veneration and reverence due to <lb/>
            their consular member, they might seem not to have rivalled <lb/>
            but followed his act: that is to say, that a public testimonial <lb/>
            should be conferred on me on a fresh day. Moreover, those <lb/>
            excellent magistrates and most obliging nobles remembered <lb/>
            that what they desired was prescribed to them by you. Could <lb/>
            I be ignorant of this ? Should I fail to vaunt it ? I should be <lb/>
            ungrateful., Truly, I feel and profess the greatest possible <lb/>
            thanks to your whole order for your exceeding kindness to me, <lb/>
            you who have dignified me with the most flattering acclamations <lb/>
            in that senate-house, in which to be named merely is the <lb/>
            highest honour. So, then, what was hard to do, and what I <lb/>
            thought truly arduous, to be pleasing to the people, acceptable <lb/>
            to the order, and approved by the magistrates and chief <lb/>
            men; this—fascination apart*—has some how befallen me. <lb/>
            What, then, remains that I should enjoy the honour of a <lb/>
            statue, but the price of the bronze and the pay of the artist ? <lb/>
            things which never failed me even in small cities, not to speak <lb/>
            of Carthage, where the most illustrious order is wont rather <lb/>
            to decree than to compute the cost even in greater affairs. But <lb/>
            of these things I will speak more when you shall have done <lb/>
            more. Also to you, noble senators, famous citizens, worthy <lb/>
            friends, I will express my thanks more at large in the book I <note type="footnote"> * Fascination apart.] — Prœfiscine dixerim. This was a common <lb/>
            form of speech for averting the ill luck which was supposed to be immi­ <lb/>
            nent where a man was excessively praised by himself or others. This <lb/>
            superstition still lingers in parts of the old Roman empire. In Corsica, <lb/>
            for instance, an affectionate father, fondling his child, will call it ugly <lb/>
            names, and bid it go be cursed-by way of cheating the devil, who is <lb/>
            always on the watch to bring about the very reverse of what men desire. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="395"/>
            will presently compose for the dedication of my statue; and I <lb/>
            will incontinently bid that book go through all the provinces, <lb/>
            and publish abroad the praises of your bounty throughout the <lb/>
            whole world, in all time to come, among all nations, through­ <lb/>
            out all years.</p>

          <p>Let those who are in the habit of obtruding themselves upon <lb/>
            the leisure moments of governors, consider how they promote <lb/>
            the fame of their genius by the immoderate volubility of their <lb/>
            tongue, and glorify themselves in a pretended appearance of <lb/>
            your friendship. Both these faults are far alien from me, <lb/>
            Scipio Orfitus. For whatever be my little genius, it is already <lb/>
            in its degree too well known to the world to need new com­ <lb/>
            mendation; and I desire more than I boast of your good-will <lb/>
            and that of men like you; since no one can desire a thing un­ <lb/>
            less he thinks it really desirable; but any one may boast <lb/>
            falsely. Moreover, I have always thus studiously applied <lb/>
            myself to good morals from the outset of my life; and you <lb/>
            yourself are a most sufficient witness that I have sought <lb/>
            such a character as to my life and pursuits both in your pro­ <lb/>
            vince and in Rome with your friends; so that my friendship <lb/>
            is not less worthy of your acceptance than yours of being <lb/>
            sought by me. For not readily to forgive one who makes his <lb/>
            visits scarce, argues a desire that one should come often; and <lb/>
            it is a great proof of friendship to delight in the frequent pre­ <lb/>
            sence of friends, to be angry with them when they stay away, <lb/>
            to praise him who is constant in his attendance, to feel the <lb/>
            loss of him who stays away; for it is certain that he must be <lb/>
            liked whose absence gives pain. But a voice bound down to <lb/>
            perpetual silence, would be of no more use than nostrils stuffed <lb/>
            with rheum, ears closed by wind, eyes veiled by cataract. <lb/>
            What if the hands be manacled ? What if the feet be fet­ <lb/>
            tered ? or our guide, the mind, be relaxed in sleep, or drowned <lb/>
            in wine, or buried in disease ? Truly as the sword is bright­ <lb/>
            ened by use, and rusts when laid by; so the voice sheathed in <lb/>
            silence loses power by long torpor. Disuse makes every one <lb/>
            slow, and sloth causes lethargy. Unless tragedians declaim <lb/>
            daily, their throats lose clearness of voice; therefore they <lb/>
            clear off their huskiness by vociferating again and again. In <lb/>
            other respects it is lost labour to exercise the human voice, fo <lb/>
             <pb n="396"/>
            it is surpassed in a great many ways, since the trumpet brays* <lb/>
            more grimly than the voice of man, the lyre is of more varied <lb/>
            compass, the flute more sweetly plaintive, the pipe warbles <lb/>
            more agreeably, and the horn is heard to a greater distance. <lb/>
            I say nothing of the inarticulate voices of many animals, which <lb/>
            are to be admired for distinct qualities: such as the deep <lb/>
            lowing of the bull, the shrill howl of the wolf, the melancholy <lb/>
            bray of the elephant, the cheerful neigh of the horse; then <lb/>
            there are the songs of excited birds, the angry roar of the lion, <lb/>
            and other voices of animals, both fierce and gentle, as they <lb/>
            are called forth by vehement rage or pleasure. Instead of <lb/>
            these, the gods have given man a voice of less volume, in­ <lb/>
            deed ; but it affords more of utility to the mind than of delight <lb/>
            to the ear. Wherefore it should be the more cultivated by <lb/>
            frequent use, and that nowhere else than in the public assem­ <lb/>
            bly, under the presidency of so great a man, in this excellent <lb/>
            concourse of many learned, many gracious men. Certainly <lb/>
            though I were a first-rate performer on the lute, I would seek <lb/>
            only crowded audiences. In solitude <lb/>
            " Orpheus in woods, Anon harped mid dolphins."t <lb/>
            Now, if legends are to be believed, Orpheus was made a soli­ <lb/>
            tary by exile, Arion was thrown overboard from a ship. The <lb/>
            one was a soother of savage beasts, the other was a delighter <lb/>
            of compassionate brutes; both were very unfortunate min­ <lb/>
            strels, for they played not spontaneously for praise, but of ne­ <lb/>
            cessity for safety. I would admire them more if they had <lb/>
            delighted men rather than brutes. Such sequestered places <lb/>
            were certainly better suited to birds, such as thrushes, night­ <lb/>
            ingales, and swans. Thrushes sing in lonely spots; nightingales <lb/>
            warble their song of youth in the African desert; swans mo­ <lb/>
            dulate their song of age in unfrequented streams. But whoso <lb/>
            has a song to sing that is good for youth, and adults, and <lb/>
            seniors, let him sing in the midst of thousands of men. Such <lb/>
            is this song of mine concerning the virtues of Orfitus; late, <lb/>
            perhaps, indeed, but serious; and not less pleasing than pro­ <lb/>
            fitable to the youths, and adults, and seniors of the Cartha­ <lb/>
            ginians, whom this worthiest of all proconsuls has relieved by <note type="footnote"> * The trumpet brays.]—The Dolphin edition read vox, tuba, lyrâ, &amp;c., <lb/>
            which are manifestly quite the reverse of the author's meaning. </note><note type="footnote"> t Orpheus in woods, &amp;c.]—Virgil, Eclogue 8. </note> <lb/>

            his indulgence; and has, by the moderation of his desires and <lb/>
            his temperate treatment, given plenty to youth, joyfulness to <lb/>
            adults, serenity to seniors. I fear, indeed, Scipio, since I have <lb/>
            touched upon your praises, lest I be curbed at present either <lb/>
            by your generous modesty or my ingenuous bashfulness. But <lb/>
            I cannot forbear, out of very many things which are most de­ <lb/>
            servedly admired in you, I cannot forbear from touching upon <lb/>
            at least a very few of these very many. Citizens preserved <lb/>
            by him, tell these over with me.</p>

          <p>You have come in such a multitude to hear me, that I must <lb/>
            rather congratulate Carthage that it counts in it so many friends <lb/>
            of learning, than apologize because as a philosopher I have <lb/>
            not refused to lecture. For the audience collected is propor­ <lb/>
            tioned to the greatness of the city, and the place selected is <lb/>
            proportioned to the magnitude of the audience. Moreover, <lb/>
            in an assembly of this sort, what is to be considered is not the <lb/>
            marble of the floor, nor the painting of the proscenium, nor <lb/>
            the columns of the stage ; nor yet the height of the roof, nor <lb/>
            the brilliancy of the cornices, nor the extent of the benches; <lb/>
            nor that here at other times the mime foots it, the comedian <lb/>
            speaks, the tragedian declaims, the rope-dancer incurs danger, <lb/>
            the juggler filches, the pantomimist gesticulates, and all the <lb/>
            other players exhibit their several performances to the people; <lb/>
            but setting aside all these things, nothing else ought to be <lb/>
            considered but the understanding of the audience and the <lb/>
            language of the speaker. Wherefore, as the poets are wont to <lb/>
            represent various cities on this spot, like that tragic writer <lb/>
            who makes the player say in the theatre, <lb/>
            " Bacchus, who in this grand Cithæron dwellest;” <lb/>
            or that comic writer,* who says- <lb/>
            " Of all your pleasant city's ample space, <lb/>
            How small the part which Plautus asks, whereon <lb/>
            He may place Athens without architects <lb/>
            in like manner let it be allowed me, too, to set here before you <lb/>
            no distant or transmarine city, but the very senate-house, the <lb/>
            very library of Carthage itself. Therefore, if I utter words <note type="footnote"> * That comic writer.] —Plautus, prologue to Truculentus. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="398"/>
            worthy of the senate, think of them as though you heard me <lb/>
            in the senate itself; if the things I deliver are learned, accept <lb/>
            them as though they were read in the library. I would that <lb/>
            I had ready a long oration corresponding to the magnitude of <lb/>
            my audience, and that my speech did not halt here where I <lb/>
            should wish to be most eloquent. But the common saying is <lb/>
            a true one: " Nothing has been granted to man by the gods <lb/>
            so fortunate but that some difficulty is nevertheless attached <lb/>
            to it;" so that in every greatest delight there lurks at least <lb/>
            some little grievance, by a certain combination of honey and <lb/>
            gall. Where there is a breast of milk there is a tuberosity. <lb/>
            This I have experienced at other times, and now especially, <lb/>
            for the more suffrages I seem to have among you in my favour, <lb/>
            the more timid I am in addressing you, from the exceeding <lb/>
            respect I bear you. I, who many a time disputed with the <lb/>
            greatest readiness among foreigners, now hesitate among my <lb/>
            own countrymen, and, strange to say, I am deterred by what <lb/>
            should allure, curbed by what should spur me, restrained by <lb/>
            what should incite me. Have I not many encouragements <lb/>
            among you, I who am neither alien to you by birth, nor unseen <lb/>
            by you in boyhood, who have had masters among you, whose <lb/>
            sect is not unknown to you, whose voice has not been unheard, <lb/>
            nor my books unread or disapproved by you? Thus, my <lb/>
            country is within the bounds of Africa, my boyhood has been <lb/>
            spent among you, and you were my masters; and my phi­ <lb/>
            losophy, though confirmed in Attic Athens, was begun here; <lb/>
            and my voice has been for more than six years familiar to <lb/>
            your ears in both languages. My books, too, nowhere receive <lb/>
            a higher honour than that they are approved by your judg­ <lb/>
            ment. These great and manifold common inducements no less <lb/>
            invite you to hear than they check me from haranguing; and I <lb/>
            could more easily celebrate your praises anywhere else than <lb/>
            among yourselves: thus, a man's modesty stands in his way <lb/>
            among his own people, but before foreigners truth is free. Ac­ <lb/>
            cordingly, I extol you always and every where as my parents <lb/>
            and first masters, and I pay you your due remuneration: not <lb/>
            that which Protagoras, the sophist, bargained for and did not <lb/>
            receive, but that which Thales the wise did not bargain for, but <lb/>
            received. I see what you desire. I will tell both stories.</p>
          <p>Protagoras was a sophist of very varied knowledge, and ex­ <lb/>
            tremely eloquent, as being one of the first inventors of rhe. <lb/>
             <pb n="399"/>
            tone. He was the fellow-citizen and contemporary of De­ <lb/>
            mocritus, the physical philosopher, from whom he derived his <lb/>
            knowledge. They say that this Protagoras stipulated with <lb/>
            his disciple, Euathlus, for an inordinate payment upon a <lb/>
            whimsical condition, namely, that he should pay him the stated <lb/>
            sum if he was successful in the first cause be pleaded before <lb/>
            the judges, and not otherwise. Euathlus, then, who was of <lb/>
            a shrewd and cunning turn of mind, having easily learned all <lb/>
            the artifices for softening judges and deceiving adversaries, and <lb/>
            all the tricks of pleaders, and knowing to his full content what <lb/>
            he had desired, began to be unwilling to pay what he had <lb/>
            promised, and to cheat his teacher with cunningly-devised ex­ <lb/>
            cuses, and for a long time would neither refuse outright nor <lb/>
            pay. At last, Protagoras summoned him before the judges, <lb/>
            and stating the condition on which he had undertaken to <lb/>
            teach him, propounded this dilemma:—“ If I gain the cause, <lb/>
            you will have to pay the price as cast in judgment; or, if you <lb/>
            gain, you will nevertheless have to pay, as bound by your bar­ <lb/>
            gain. Thus, if you beat me, you fall under the force of the <lb/>
            condition; if you are beaten, you will lie under the decree of <lb/>
            the court. What more would you have ?" The conclusion <lb/>
            appeared to the judges to be cogently and unanswerably made <lb/>
            out. But Euathlus, as a most finished disciple of so subtle a <lb/>
            teacher, turned his own dilemma against him. "If the thing <lb/>
            is so," said he, 11 in neither way do I owe what you demand. <lb/>
            For either I gain the cause, and am cleared by the decree of <lb/>
            the court, or I am beaten, and then I am discharged by our <lb/>
            bargain, according to which, I owe you no payment if I shall <lb/>
            have been beaten in this first cause I plead before the judges. <lb/>
            Thus, I am acquitted in every way; by the verdict if I beat <lb/>
            you, by our condition if I am beaten."</p>
          <p>Do not these sophisms, turned against each other, seem to <lb/>
            you like burs rolled together by the wind, which stick each <lb/>
            other alike by their prickles ? Let us leave then this thorny <lb/>
            pay of Protagoras to the crafty and the avaricious ; far better <lb/>
            is that other pay which Thales is said to have demanded. <lb/>
            Thales, the Milesian, was decidedly the foremost of the cele­ <lb/>
            brated seven wise men; for he was the first discoverer of geo- . <lb/>
            metry among the Greeks, a sure explorer of nature, and a <lb/>
            skilful observer of the stars; by means of small lines he dis­ <lb/>
            covered vast things, the circuits of the seasons, the courses of <lb/>
             <pb n="400"/>
            the winds, the paths of the stars, the sonorous marvels of the <lb/>
            thunder, the oblique courses of the constellations, the annual <lb/>
            revolution of the sun; likewise, the increase of the new moon, <lb/>
            the waning of the old, and the obstacles that cause her light <lb/>
            to fail. He also, when advanced in years, excogitated a di­ <lb/>
            vine theory, respecting the sun, which I have not only learned <lb/>
            but confirmed by experience, namely, by what multiple of its <lb/>
            diameter the sun measures its own orbit. Thales is related to <lb/>
            have demonstrated this recent discovery of his, to Mandraytus <lb/>
            the Prienensian, who being intensely delighted with that new <lb/>
            and unexpected observation, bade him name whatever reward <lb/>
            he desired for so great a communication. "I shall be sum- <lb/>
            ciently paid," said Thales the Wise, "if, when you have be­ <lb/>
            gun to unfold to others what you have learned from me, you <lb/>
            do not attribute it to yourself, but declare that it was I, and <lb/>
            no one else, who discovered it." A handsome payment truly, <lb/>
            worthy of such a man, and perpetual! For at this day, and <lb/>
            in all time to come, that tribute will be paid to Thales by all <lb/>
            of us who are truly acquainted with his celestial studies. <lb/>
            This is the kind of payment I everywhere make on your ac­ <lb/>
            count, Carthaginians, for the education I received among you <lb/>
            in my boyhood, For I everywhere declare myself a nursling <lb/>
            of your city; everywhere I extol you in all manner of ways; <lb/>
            I diligently cultivate your literature; I boast of your wealth; <lb/>
            and I religiously venerate your gods.</p>
          <p>Now, too, I will take for the most auspicious subject of my <lb/>
            exordium, your god, AEsculapius, who propitiously regards <lb/>
            your citadel of Carthage with his indubitable divinity. I will <lb/>
            here sing to you a hymn in honour of that god, which I have <lb/>
            composed in Greek and Latin. For I am his not unknown <lb/>
            priest, nor recent worshipper, nor unfavoured minister; and <lb/>
            I have already paid him reverence in prose and verse, in like <lb/>
            manner as I shall now sing his hymn in both languages. I <lb/>
            have prefaced it with a dialogue likewise in Greek and Latin, <lb/>
            the speakers being Sabidius Severus and Julius Persius, men <lb/>
            who, with good reason, are the warmest friends to each other, <lb/>
            and to you, and to the public weal, and are equals in learning, <lb/>
            eloquence, and good feeling; and of whom it is a question <lb/>
            whether they are more distinguished by their placid modera­ <lb/>
            tion, their prompt ingenuity, or their eminent honours. <lb/>
            Thoroughly at concord as they are, there is yet between them <lb/>
             <pb n="401"/>
            this sole emulation, this sole contest, which of them more loves <lb/>
            Carthage, and on this point they both contend with all their <lb/>
            might, but neither yields the victory. Thinking that a dis­ <lb/>
            course between them would be most pleasing to you, a con­ <lb/>
            genial subject of composition to me, and worthy of being dedi­ <lb/>
            cated to the service of religion, I introduce in the beginning <lb/>
            of my work, one of my fellow students at Athens inquiring of <lb/>
            Persius, in Greek, what I had delivered the day before in the <lb/>
            temple of JEsculapius; and presently I add to them Severus, <lb/>
            whom meanwhile I have made speak Latin. For though Per­ <lb/>
            sius is perfectly acquainted with Latin, he will to-day speak <lb/>
            for you and me in the Attic tongue.</p>

          <p>Asclepiades, one of the first of physicians, and superior to <lb/>
            all, Hippocrates alone excepted, was the first who used wine <lb/>
            as a remedy for the sick; but with this precaution, that he <lb/>
            gave it in good time, a point which he was very sagacious in <lb/>
            determining, being a most diligent observer of the inordinate <lb/>
            or depraved pulsation of the arteries. Once, when he returned <lb/>
            to the city from his country house, he saw a great funeral pile <lb/>
            in the outskirts of the town, and around it a vast multitude, <lb/>
            who had followed the funeral, all in great grief and soiled <lb/>
            garments. He went up to the spot, as is the nature of the <lb/>
            human mind, that he might know who it was, since no one <lb/>
            answered his enquiries. Or, rather, he went that he might <lb/>
            notice something in the deceased by means of his art. At all <lb/>
            events, he took away death from that man who was stretched <lb/>
            on the bier and nearly consigned to the tomb. The unfortunate <lb/>
            man's body was already all bedewed with perfumes, and his <lb/>
            face was anointed with odorous ointment. Having carefully <lb/>
            contemplated the man thus anointed and made ready for the <lb/>
            funeral banquet, he noticed in him certain signs, handled the <lb/>
            body again and again, and found life latent in it. Instantly <lb/>
            he cried out that the man was alive, that they should take <lb/>
            away the torches, put out the fire, pull down the pile, and <lb/>
            carry back the funeral banquet from the tomb to the table. <lb/>
            Meanwhile, a murmur arose, some saying that the physician <lb/>
            should be believed, others making a mock of medicine. Fi­ <lb/>
            nally, against the will of all the relations, whether it was that <lb/>
            they were disappointed of the inheritance, or that they did not <note type="footnote"> D D </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="402"/>
            believe him, Asclepiades, with great difficulty, obtained a brief <lb/>
            respite for the defunct, and so, in the end, he took him back <lb/>
            to his house, snatched from the hands of the undertakers, and <lb/>
            as it were from the infernal regions, and immediately revived <lb/>
            his spirits, and called forth, by some medicine, the vital breath <lb/>
            that was lurking in the recesses of his body.</p>

          <p>There is a celebrated saying of a wise man concerning the <lb/>
            table. The first cup is for thirst, the second for mirth, the <lb/>
            third for delight, the fourth for madness. The goblet of the <lb/>
            Muses, on the contrary, the oftener it is drained and the more <lb/>
            unmixed it is, the more it conduces to soundness of mind. <lb/>
            The first cup, that of the reading master, takes away igno­ <lb/>
            rance ; the second, of the grammarian, instructs in science; <lb/>
            the third, the rhetorician's, anus with eloquence. Thus far <lb/>
            most people drink. But I have drunk other cups at Athens ; <lb/>
            the cup of poetry, the inventive; of geometry, the limpid; <lb/>
            of music, the sweet; of dialectics, the roughish ; and of uni­ <lb/>
            versal philosophy, the never-satiating nectareous cup. For <lb/>
            Empedocles gives us verses ; Plato, dialogues ; Socrates, <lb/>
            hymns ; Epicharmus, modulations; Xenophon, histories ; <lb/>
            Xenocrates, satires : your Apuleius all these together; and he <lb/>
            has cultivated the nine Muses with equal assiduity, that is to <lb/>
            say, with more good-will than capacity. Perhaps he is the <lb/>
            more to be praised for this, since in all good things the at­ <lb/>
            tempt is laudable, the effect contingent; whilst, conversely in <lb/>
            evil things, crimes that are but designed, not accomplished, <lb/>
            are punished; the mind being blood-stained, the hands pure. <lb/>
            Therefore, just as it suffices for the incurring of punishment <lb/>
            to have meditated things that deserve punishment, so it is a <lb/>
            sufficient cause of praise to attempt laudable things. But <lb/>
            what greater or surer source of praise is there than to speak <lb/>
            well at Carthage, where all your citizens are most learned ; <lb/>
            among whom, boys learn all they know, adults exhibit it, and <lb/>
            old men teach it ? Carthage, the venerable mistress of our <lb/>
            province ; Carthage, the celestial Muse of Africa; Carthage, <lb/>
            the Camœna of those who wear the toga.</p>

          <p>Even necessary haste sometimes admits of proper delay, so <lb/>
             <pb n="403"/>
            that you may often be pleased at the interruption of your pur­ <lb/>
            pose. So it is with those who have occasion to travel fast, so <lb/>
            that they would rather ride on horseback than sit in a car, on <lb/>
            account of the annoyance of baggage, the weight of vehicles, <lb/>
            the clogging of wheels, the roughness of the track, the heaps <lb/>
            of stones, the projecting roots of trees, the streams on the <lb/>
            plain, and the declivities of hills. Wishing, then, to avoid all <lb/>
            these retardations, they select a riding-horse of enduring powers <lb/>
            and lively speed, strong to bear and a good goer, <lb/>
            " That sweeps at equal pace o'er hill and dale," <lb/>
            as Lucilius says. Then, when they are riding at the horse's <lb/>
            speed along the way, if they espy any man of high station, of <lb/>
            great influence, and well known, in spite of their haste they <lb/>
            check their speed and stop their horse ; they jump down, and <lb/>
            pa3s the rod they carry for beating the horse into their left hand. <lb/>
            With their right hand thus at liberty, they go up and salute <lb/>
            him; and if he asks questions at some length, they walk for <lb/>
            some time, and chat with him. In short, they willingly sub­ <lb/>
            mit to any delay, as a matter of courtesy.</p>

          <p>As we see a good ship, well built, stoutly put together <lb/>
            within, elegantly painted without, having a helm that moves <lb/>
            freely, strong rigging, a tall mast, a fine mast top, shining sails, <lb/>
            and, in short, found in everything requisite for use, and fair to <lb/>
            see; but if the helmsman does not steer that ship, either it is <lb/>
            driven before the tempest, or the deeps engulf, or the rocks <lb/>
            shatter it with all its excellent gear. Again, when physicians <lb/>
            enter a house to visit a sick man, none of them ever bids the <lb/>
            patient be of good cheer, because they see in the house hand­ <lb/>
            some bookcases, gilded cornices, and crowds of boys and youths <lb/>
            of comely form waiting in the chamber round the bed. But <lb/>
            when the physician has sat down by the patient, he takes his <lb/>
            hand, feels it, notes the pulse and the force of the arteries, and <lb/>
            if he find anything disturbed and inordinate there, he tells the <lb/>
            man that his case is a bad one. That wealthy patient is for­ <lb/>
            bidden food, and that day he gets no food in his opulent house, <lb/>
            though, meanwhile, all his domestics feast and make good cheer <lb/>
            In that respect his fortune avails him nothing.</p><pb n="404"/>

          <p>You who wished me to speak extempore, hear now a rude <lb/>
            attempt after a finished specimen. For, as I think, I shall <lb/>
            venture with a fair chance, when I am to speak improvise, after <lb/>
            having made premeditated speeches which have been approved; <lb/>
            nor am I afraid that I shall displease in trivial things, since I <lb/>
            have given satisfaction in more serious matters. But that you <lb/>
            may test and know me in every way, try me in this rough and <lb/>
            unfinished sketch, as Lucilius says, whether I am the same on <lb/>
            a sudden as when prepared; if, indeed, there are any among <lb/>
            you who have not heard any of these off-hand efforts of mine, <lb/>
            which you will listen to with the same attention as you hearken <lb/>
            to those discourses which we write and recite, and with more <lb/>
            indulgence. For so it is usual with wise men to exercise more <lb/>
            accurate judgment with elaborate works, and more indulgence <lb/>
            towards those that are unprepared. For you weigh and exa­ <lb/>
            mine w hat is written, and you hear at once impromptu dis­ <lb/>
            courses, and pardon what is amiss in them, and with good rea­ <lb/>
            son. For those things which we recite when written, will be <lb/>
            such as they were composed, even though you be silent; but <lb/>
            those which are to be produced on the spot, and, as it were, in <lb/>
            combination with you, will be such as you shall have made them <lb/>
            by your favour. The more I sink in my discourse, the more <lb/>
            it will be lifted up by you. I perceive that you hear me will­ <lb/>
            ingly. So it is in your power to spread my sail, and inflate it, <lb/>
            that it may not hang flaccid, or be furled and brailed. Now, I <lb/>
            will venture to do that which Aristippus said. That Aristippus <lb/>
            was the founder of the Cyrenaic sect, and what he himself most <lb/>
            desired, a disciple of Socrates. A certain tyrant asked him, <lb/>
            What good had he got by his intent and long-continued pur­ <lb/>
            suit of philosophy? "To be able to speak at my ease and <lb/>
            intrepidly with all men," replied Aristippus. This saying was <lb/>
            impromptu, for the occasion was sudden; just as in rubble ma­ <lb/>
            sonry it is necessary that stones should be laid down as they <lb/>
            come to hand, no grouting being interposed within, nor their <lb/>
            position made even in front, nor their faces arranged by line. <lb/>
            I, myself, the builder of this oration, will not bring to it from <lb/>
            my quarry a stone cut fair, well squared, and accurately <lb/>
            smoothed on all its faces; but I will fit to every part of the <lb/>
            work rough and uneven stones, or smooth and slippery, or round <lb/>
            and rolling, without correcting them by the rule, or equalizing <lb/>
             <pb n="405"/>
            them on measuring, or adjusting them by the plumb-line. Fox <lb/>
            nothing can be at the same time hurried and deliberate; nor <lb/>
            can anything possess at once the merit of elaboration and the <lb/>
            grace of despatch. I have yielded to the wish of some who <lb/>
            greatly desired that I should speak extempore what was ex­ <lb/>
            pected of me ; and, by Hercules! there is some fear lest that <lb/>
            befal me which is narrated by Æsop of his crow: that is, that <lb/>
            whilst I catch at this new glory, I shall lose that little glory <lb/>
            which I have already acquired. If you call upon me for the <lb/>
            apologue, I shall have no objection to deliver a fable.</p>
          <p>A Crow and a Fox simultaneously espied a gobbet, and has­ <lb/>
            tened to seize it with equal greed but unequal speed-the <lb/>
            Fox running, the Crow flying. The bird outstripped the beast, <lb/>
            gliding before him with both wings outspread to the favouring <lb/>
            gale; and then exulting at once in the booty and the victory, <lb/>
            soared aloft, and perched securely on the top of an oak. Never­ <lb/>
            theless, even there the Fox hit the victor with a trick, because <lb/>
            he could not hit him with a stone; for he went up to the same <lb/>
            tree, and stopping when he saw the spoiler aloft, exulting over <lb/>
            his booty, began cunningly to flatter him. “Truly I was <lb/>
            foolish to contend in vain with the bird of Apollo, whose body <lb/>
            is so elegant, neither very small, nor too large, but just of the <lb/>
            size sufficient for use and beauty, with soft plumage, a delicate <lb/>
            head, and strong beak. It is a bird of keen eye and tenacious <lb/>
            talons. But what shall I say of its colour? For, whereas <lb/>
            two colours were superior to all others, black and white, which <lb/>
            mark the difference between day and night, Apollo bestowed <lb/>
            both on his birds-white on the swan, black on the crow. I <lb/>
            wish that, as he granted song to the swan, he had also given <lb/>
            voice to this bird, that so beautiful a bird, far the first of the <lb/>
            whole feathered creation, the pet of the eloquent god, might <lb/>
            not live mute and tongueless." When the Crow heard that <lb/>
            this alone was wanting to him that he should surpass the rest <lb/>
            of the birds, he resolved to croak as loud as he could, to show <lb/>
            that in that respect he was not inferior to the swan ; and for­ <lb/>
            getting the gobbet he held in his beak, he opened it as wide <lb/>
            as he could gape; and thus he lost by his song what he <lb/>
            had won by his flight; but the Fox recovered by his craft what <lb/>
            he had lost in running.</p>
          <p>Let us epitomise this fable as compactly as possible. The <lb/>
            Crow, to prove itself a vocalist, the only thing which the Fox <lb/>
             <pb n="406"/>
            had pretended was wanting to its great beauty, began to croak, <lb/>
            and made the wheedling Fox possessor of the booty it held in <lb/>
            its beak.</p>

          <p>I know well what you desire by this token, namely, that I <lb/>
            should proceed with the rest of the Latin matter. For in the <lb/>
            beginning, when you asked for different things, I remember <lb/>
            to have promised that neither portion of you, neither those <lb/>
            who called for Latin nor those who called for Greek, should <lb/>
            go away disappointed. Wherefore, if you please, let us con­ <lb/>
            clude that I have talked Greek long enough. It is now time <lb/>
            to migrate from Greece to Latium. For we have now come <lb/>
            nearly to the middle of this discourse; and, as I think, this <lb/>
            latter part, compared with the Greek portion which preceded <lb/>
            it, is neither less copious in arguments, nor less abundant <lb/>
            in maxims, nor more scant of examples, nor more brief in <lb/>
            matter.</p>

            And vibrates quick his forky tongue, <lb/>
            And glitters in his burnish'd scales.</p>
          <p>Yes! though with heaven's own transports warm <lb/>
            Thy soul in boundless rapture swims, <lb/>

            Her tingling flesh with horror creeps, <lb/>
            The life-blood curdling in her heart.</p>
          <p>All ghastly pale her beauteous cheek, 4 <lb/>
            She throws her moonstruck gaze around, <lb/>
            Utters a feeble, faultering shriek, <lb/>
            And senseless sinks upon the ground.</p>
          <p>Then as some parch'd and withering flower <lb/>

            Some short distraction to the joyless mind <lb/>
            Which grief, with heavy chain, hath fast confined <lb/>
            To sad remembrance of its happier state; <lb/>
            For to myself I ask no boon more kind <lb/>
            Than power another's woes to mitigate, <lb/>
            And that soft soothing art which anguish can abate.</p>
          <p>And thou, sweet sprite, whose. sway doth far extend. <lb/>
            Smile on the mean historian of thy fame! <lb/>
            My heart in each distress and fear befriend, <lb/>
            Nor ever let it feel a fiercer flame <lb/>
            Than innocence may cherish free from blame, <lb/>
            And hope may nurse, and sympathy may own; <lb/>
            For, as thy rights I never would disclaim, <lb/>

            So may I love but one, by one beloved alone.</p>
          <p>That anxious torture may I never feel, <lb/>
            Which, doubtful, watches o'er a wandering heart, <lb/>
            Oh ! who that bitter torment can reveal, <lb/>
            Or tell the pining anguish of that smart! <lb/>
            In those affections may I ne'er have part, <lb/>

            No, dearest Cupid! when I feel thy dart, <lb/>

          <p>MUCH wearied with her long and dreary way, <lb/>
            And now with toil and sorrow well nigh spent. <lb/>
            Of sad regret and wasting grief the prey, <lb/>
            Fair Psyche through untrodden forests went, <lb/>
            To lone shades uttering oft a vain lament. <lb/>
            And oft in hopeless silence sighing deep, <lb/>
            As she her fatal error did repent, <lb/>
            While dear remembrance bade her ever weep, <lb/>
            And her pale check in ceaseless showers of sorrow steep,</p><pb n="433"/>
            
          <p>'Mid the thick covert of that woodland shade, <lb/>
            A flowery bank there lay undressed by art, <lb/>
            But of the mossy turf spontaneous made; <lb/>
            Here the young branches shot their arms athwart, <lb/>
            And wove the bower so thick in every part, <lb/>
            That the fierce beams of Phœbus glancing strong <lb/>
            Could never through the leaves their fury dart; <lb/>
            But the sweet creeping shrubs that round it throng, <lb/>
            Their loving fragrance mix, and trail their flowers along.</p>
          <p>And close beside a little fountain played, <lb/>
            Which through the trembling leaves all joyous shone, <lb/>
            And with the cheerful birds sweet music made, <lb/>
            Kissing the surface of each polished stone <lb/>
            As it flowed past: sure as her favourite throne <lb/>
            Tranquillity might well esteem the bower, <lb/>
            The fresh and cool retreat have called her own, <lb/>
            A pleasant shelter in the sultry hour, <lb/>
            A refuge from the blast, and angry tempest's power.</p>
          <p>Wooed by the soothing silence of the scene, <lb/>
            Here Psyche stood, and looking round, lest aught <lb/>
            Which threatened danger near her might have been, <lb/>
            A while to rest her in that quiet spot <lb/>
            She laid her down, and piteously bethought <lb/>
            Herself on the sad changes of her fate, <lb/>
            Which in so short a space so much had wrought, <lb/>
            And now had raised her to such high estate, <lb/>
            And now had plunged her low in sorrow desolate.</p>
          <p>Oh! how refreshing seemed the breathing wind <lb/>
            To her faint limbs ! and while her snowy hands <lb/>
            From her fair brow her golden hair unbind, <lb/>
            And of her zone unloose the silken bands, <lb/>
            More passing bright unveiled her beauty stands ; <lb/>
            For faultless was her form as beauty's queen, <lb/>
            And every winning grace that Love demands, <lb/>
            With mild attempered dignity was seen <lb/>
            Play o'er each lovely limb, and deck her angel mien. <note type="footnote"> F F </note> <lb/>

            Though solitary now, dismayed, forlorn, <lb/>
            Without attendant through the forest rude, <lb/>
            The peerless maid, of royal lineage born, <lb/>
            By many a royal youth had oft been wooed ; <lb/>
            Low at her feet full many a prince had sued, <lb/>
            And homage paid unto her beauty rare; <lb/>
            But all their blandishments her heart withstood; <lb/>
            And well might mortal suitor sure despair, <lb/>
            Since mortal charms were none which might with hers compare.</p>
          <p>Yet nought of insolence or haughty pride <lb/>
            Found ever in her gentle breast a place; <lb/>
            Though men her wondrous beauty deified, <lb/>
            And rashly deeming such celestial grace <lb/>
            Could never spring from any earthly race, <lb/>
            Lo! all forsaking Cytherea's shrine, <lb/>
            Her sacred altars now no more embrace, <lb/>
            But to fair Psyche pay those rites divine, <lb/>
            Which, Goddess ! are thy due, and should be only thine.</p>
          <p>But envy of her beauty's growing fame <lb/>
            Poisoned her sisters' hearts with secret gall, <lb/>
            And oft with seeming piety they blame <lb/>
            The worship which they justly impious call; <lb/>
            And oft, lest evil should their sire befal, <lb/>
            Besought him to forbid the erring crowd <lb/>
            Which hourly thronged around the regal hall. <lb/>
            With incense, gifts, and invocations loud, <lb/>
            To her whose guiltless breast ne'er felt elation proud.</p>
          <p>For she was timid as the wintry flower, <lb/>
            That, whiter than the snow it blooms among, <lb/>
            Droops its fair head submissive to the power <lb/>
            Of every angry blast which sweeps along, <lb/>
            Sparing the lovely tremblei, while'the strong <lb/>
            Majestic tenants of the leafless wood <lb/>
            It levels low. But, ah! the pitying song <lb/>
            Must tell how, than the tempest's self more rude, <lb/>
            Fierce wrath ind cruel hate their suppliant prey pursued.</p><pb n="435"/>
            
          <p>Indignant quitting her deserted fanes, <lb/>
            Now Cytherea sought her favourite isle, <lb/>
            And there from every eye her secret pains <lb/>
            'Mid her thick myrtle bowers concealed a while; <lb/>
            Practised no more the glance, or witching smile, <lb/>
            But nursed the pang she never felt before, <lb/>
            Of mortified disdain; then to beguile <lb/>
            The hours which mortal flattery soothed no more, <lb/>
            She various plans revolved her influence to restore.</p>
          <p>She called her son with unaccustomed voice ; <lb/>
            Not with those thrilling accents of delight <lb/>
            Which bade so oft enchanted Love rejoice, <lb/>
            Soft as the breezes of a summer's night: <lb/>
            Now choked with rage its change could Love affright; <lb/>
            As all to sudden discontent a prey, <lb/>
            Shunning the cheerful day's enlivening light, <lb/>
            She felt the angry power's malignant sway, <lb/>
            And bade her favourite boy her vengeful will obey.</p>
          <p>Bathed in those tears which vanquish human hearts, <lb/>
            " Oh, son beloved!" (the suppliant goddess cried,) <lb/>
            " If e'er thy too indulgent mother's arts <lb/>

            Now let thy fierce revenge my foe pursue, <lb/>
            And let my rival scorned her vain presumption rue.</p>

            That, fairer than the wife of Jove confess, <lb/>
            I gained the prize thus basely to be lost ? <lb/>
            With me the world's devotion to contest <lb/>
            Behold a mortal dares; though on my breast <lb/>
            Still vainly brilliant shines the magic zone. <lb/>
            Yet, yet I reign: by you my wrongs redrest, <lb/>
            The world with humbled Psyche soon shall own <lb/>

            Which flows so near thy bright and crystal tide; <lb/>
            Deep let her heart thy sharpest arrow sting, <lb/>
            Its tempered barb in that black poison dyed. <lb/>
            Let her, for whom contending princes sighed, <lb/>
            Feel all the fury of thy fiercest flame <lb/>
            For some base wretch to foul disgrace allied, <lb/>
            Forgetful of her birth and her fair fame, <lb/>
            Her honours all defiled, and sacrificed to shame."</p>
          <p>Then, with sweet pressure of her rosy lip, <lb/>
            A kiss she gave bathed in ambrosial dew ; <lb/>
            The thrilling joy he would for ever sip, <lb/>
            And his moist eyes in ecstasy imbrue. <lb/>
            But she whose soul still angry cares pursue, <lb/>
            Snatched from the soft caress her glowing charms ; <lb/>
            Her vengeful will she then enforced anew, <lb/>
            As she in haste dismissed him from her arms, <lb/>
            The cruel draught to seek of anguish and alarms.</p>
          <p>'Mid the blue waves by circling seas embraced, <lb/>
            A chosen spot of fairest land was seen; <lb/>
            For there with favouring hand had Nature placed <lb/>
            All that could lovely make the varied scene : <lb/>
            Eternal Spring there spread her mantle green ; <lb/>
            There high surrounding hills deep-wooded rose <lb/>
            O'er placid lakes; while marble rocks between <lb/>
            The fragrant shrubs their pointed heads disclose, <lb/>
            And balmy breathes each gale which o'er the island blows</p>
          <p>Pleasure had called the fertile lawns her own, <lb/>
            And thickly strewed them with her choicest flowers; <lb/>
            Amid the quiet glade her golden throne <lb/>
            Bright shone with lustre through o'erarching bowers: <lb/>
            There her fair train, the ever-downy Hours, <lb/>
            Sport on light wing with the young Joys entwined ; <lb/>
            While Hope delighted from her full lap showers <lb/>
            Blossoms, whose fragrance can the ravished mind <lb/>
            Inebriate with dreams of rapture unconfined</p><pb n="437"/>
            
          <p>And in the. grassy centre of the isle, <lb/>
            Where the thick verdure spreads a damper shade, <lb/>
            Amid their native rocks concealed a while, <lb/>
            Then o'er the plains in devious streams displayed, <lb/>
            Two gushing fountains rise ; and thence conveyed, <lb/>
            Their waters through the woods and valleys play, <lb/>
            Visit each green recess and secret glade, <lb/>
            With still unmingled, still meandering way, <lb/>
            Nor widely wandering far, can each from other stray.</p>
          <p>But of strange contrast are their virtues found, <lb/>
            And oft the lady of that isle has tried <lb/>
            In rocky dens and caverns under ground, <lb/>
            The black deformed stream in vain to hide ; <lb/>
            Bursting all bounds her labours it defied; <lb/>
            Yet many a flowery sod its course conceals <lb/>
            Through plains where deep its silent waters glide, <lb/>
            Till secret ruin all corroding steals, <lb/>
            And every treacherous arch the hideous gulph reveals.</p>
          <p>Forbidding every kindly prosperous growth, <lb/>
            Where'er it ran, a channel bleak it wore; <lb/>
            The gaping banks receded, as though loth <lb/>
            To touch the poison which disgraced their shore: <lb/>
            There deadly anguish pours unmixed his store <lb/>
            Of all the ills which sting the human breast, <lb/>
            The hopeless tears which past delights deplore, <lb/>
            Heart-gnawing jealousy which knows no rest, <lb/>
            And self-upbraiding shame, by stern remorse opprest.</p>
          <p>Oh, how unlike the pure transparent stream, <lb/>
            Which near it bubbles o'er its golden sands! <lb/>
            The impeding stones with pleasant music seem <lb/>
            Its progress to detain from other lands ; <lb/>
            And all its banks, inwreathed with flowery bands, <lb/>
            Ambrosial fragrance shed in grateful dew: <lb/>
            There young Desire enchanted ever stands, <lb/>
            Breathing delight and fragrance ever new, <lb/>
            And bathed in constant joys of fond affection true.</p><pb n="438"/>
            
          <p>But not to mortals is it e'er allowed <lb/>
            To drink unmingled of that current bright; <lb/>
            Scarce can they taste the pleasurable flood, <lb/>
            Defiled by angry Fortune's envious spite; <lb/>
            Who from the cup of amorous delight <lb/>
            Dashes the sparkling draught of brilliant joy, <lb/>
            Till, with dull sorrow's stream despoiled quite, <lb/>
            No more it cheers the soul nor charms the eye, <lb/>
            But 'mid the poisoned bowl distrust and anguish lie.</p>
          <p>Here Cupid tempers his unerring darts, <lb/>
            And in the fount of bliss delights to play; <lb/>
            Here mingles balmy sighs and pleasing smarts, <lb/>
            And here the honied draught will oft allay <lb/>
            With that black poison's all-polluting sway, <lb/>
            For wretched man. Hither, as Venus willed, <lb/>
            For Psyche's punishment he bent his way : <lb/>
            From either stream his amber vase he filled, <lb/>
            For her were meant the drops which grief alone distilled.</p>
          <p>His quiver, sparkling bright with gems and gold, <lb/>
            From his fair plumed shoulder graceful hung, <lb/>
            And from its top in brilliant chords enrolled <lb/>
            Each little vase resplendently was slung : <lb/>
            Still as he flew, around him sportive clung <lb/>
            His frolic train of winged Zephyrs light, <lb/>
            Wafting the fragrance which his tresses flung : <lb/>
            While odours dropped from every ringlet bright, <lb/>
            And from his blue eyes beamed ineffable delight.</p>
          <p>Wrapt in a cloud unseen by mortal eye, <lb/>
            He sought the chamber of the royal maid; <lb/>
            There, lulled by careless soft security, <lb/>
            Of the impending mischief nought afraid, <lb/>
            Upon her purple couch was Psyche laid, <lb/>
            Her radiant eyes a downy slumber sealed; <lb/>
            In light transparent veil alone arrayed, <lb/>
            Her bosom's opening charms were half revealed, <lb/>
            And scarce the lucid folds her polished limbs concealed.</p><pb n="439"/>
            
          <p>A placid smile plays o'er each roseate lip, <lb/>
            Sweet severed lips! while thus your pearls disclose, <lb/>
            That slumbering thus unconscious she may sip <lb/>
            The cruel presage of her future woes! <lb/>
            Lightly, as fall the dews upon the rose, <lb/>
            Upon the coral gates of that sweet cell <lb/>
            The fatal drops he pours; nor yet he knows, <lb/>
            Nor, though a God, can he presaging tell <lb/>
            How he himself shall mourn the ills of that sad spell!</p>
          <p>Nor yet content, he from his quiver drew, <lb/>
            Sharpened with skill divine, a shining dart: <lb/>
            No need had he for bow, since thus too true <lb/>
            His hand might wound her all-exposed heart; <lb/>
            Yet her fair side he touched with gentlest art, <lb/>
            And half relenting on her beauties gazed; <lb/>
            Just then awaking with a sudden start, <lb/>
            Her opening eye in humid lustre blazed, <lb/>
            Unseen he still remained, enchanted and amazed.</p>
          <p>The dart which in his hand now trembling stood, <lb/>
            As o'er the couch he bent with ravished eye, <lb/>
            Drew with its daring point celestial blood <lb/>
            From his smooth neck's unblemish'd ivory: <lb/>
            Heedless of this, but with a pitying sigh <lb/>
            The evil done now anxious to repair, <lb/>
            He shed in haste the balmy drops of joy <lb/>
            O'er all the silky ringlets of her hair; <lb/>
            Then stretched his plumes divine, and breathed celestial air,</p>
          <p>Unhappy Psyche ! soon the latent wound <lb/>
            The fading roses of her cheek confess, <lb/>
            Her eyes' bright beams, in swimming sorrows drowned, <lb/>
            Sparkle no more with life and happiness, <lb/>
            Her parents' fond exulting heart to bless ; <lb/>
            She shuns adoring crowds, and seeks to hide <lb/>
            The pining sorrows which her soul oppress, <lb/>
            Till to her mother's tears no more denied, <lb/>
            The secret grief she owns, for which she lingering sighed. -</p><pb n="440"/>
            
          <p>A dream of mingled terror and delight <lb/>
            Still heavy hangs upon her troubled soul, <lb/>
            An angry form still swims before her sight, <lb/>
            And still the vengeful thunders seem to roll; <lb/>
            Still crushed to earth she feels the stern control <lb/>
            Of Venus unrelenting, unappeased : <lb/>
            The dream returns, she feels the fancied dole; <lb/>
            Once more the furies on her heart have seized, <lb/>
            But still she views the youth who all her sufferings eased.</p>
          <p>Of wondrous beauty did the vision seem, <lb/>
            And in the freshest prime of youthful years; <lb/>
            Such at the close of her distressful dream <lb/>
            A graceful champion to her eyes appears; <lb/>
            Her loved deliverer from her foes and fears <lb/>
            She seems in grateful transport still to press; <lb/>
            Still his soft voice sounds in her ravished ears; <lb/>
            Dissolved in fondest tears of tenderness, <lb/>
            His form she oft invokes her waking eyes to bless.</p>
          <p>Nor was it quite a dream, for as she woke, <lb/>
            Ere heavenly mists concealed him from her eye, <lb/>
            One sudden transitory view she took <lb/>
            Of Love's most radiant bright divinity; <lb/>
            From the fair image never can she fly, <lb/>
            As still consumed with vain desire she pines; <lb/>
            While her fond parents heave the anxious sigh, <lb/>
            And to avert her fate seek holy shrines <lb/>
            The threatened ills to learn by auguries and signs.</p>
          <p>And now, the royal sacrifice prepared, <lb/>
            The milk-white bull they to the altar lead, <lb/>
            Whose youth the galling yoke as yet had spared, <lb/>
            Now destined by the sacred knife to bleed: <lb/>
            When lo! with sudden spring his horns he freed, <lb/>
            And head-long rushed amid the frighted throng: <lb/>
            While from the smoke-veiled shrine such sounds proceed <lb/>
            As well might strike with awe the soul most strong; <lb/>
            And thus divinely spoke the heaven-inspired tongue.</p><pb n="441"/>
            
          <p>" On nuptial couch, in nuptial vest arrayed, <lb/>

            Who never must a mortal Hymen grace: <lb/>
            A winged monster of no earthly race <lb/>
            Thence soon shall bear his trembling bride away ; <lb/>
            His power extends o'er all the bounds of space. <lb/>
            And Jove himself has owned his dreaded sway, <lb/>
            Whose flaming breath sheds fire, whom earth and heaven obey."</p>
          <p>With terror, anguish, and astonishment <lb/>
            The oracle her wretched father hears ; <lb/>
            Now from his brow the regal honours rent, <lb/>
            And now in frantic sorrow wild appears, <lb/>
            Nor threatened plagues, nor punishment he fears, <lb/>
            Refusing long the sentence to obey, <lb/>
            Till Psyche, trembling with submissive tears, <lb/>
            Bids them the sacrifice no more delay, <lb/>
            Prepare the funeral couch, and leave the destined prey.</p>
          <p>Pleased by the ambiguous doom the Fates promulge, <lb/>
            The angry Goddess and enamoured Boy <lb/>
            Alike content their various hopes indulge; <lb/>
            He, still exploring with an anxious eye <lb/>
            The future prospect of uncertain joy, <lb/>
            Plans how the tender object of his care <lb/>
            He may protect from threatened misery; <lb/>
            Ah, sanguine Love ! so oft deceived, forbear <lb/>
            With flattering tints to paint illusive hope so fair</p>
          <p>But now what lamentations rend the skies ! <lb/>
            In amaracine wreaths the virgin choir <lb/>
            With Io Hymen mingle funeral cries : <lb/>
            Lost in the sorrows of the Lydian lyre <lb/>
            The breathing flutes' melodious notes expire; <lb/>
            In sad procession pass the mournful throng, <lb/>
            Extinguishing with tears the torches' fire, <lb/>
            While the mute victim weeping crowds among, <lb/>
            By unknown fears oppressed, moves silently along.</p><pb n="442"/>
            
          <p>But on such scenes of terror and dismay <lb/>

            She quits well pleased the melancholy lay, <lb/>
            Nor vainly seeks the parents' woes to tell: <lb/>
            But what to wondering Psyche then befel <lb/>
            When thus abandoned, let her rather say, <lb/>
            Who shuddering looks to see some monster fell <lb/>
            Approach the desert rock to seize his prey, <lb/>
            With cruel fangs devour, or tear her thence away.</p>
          <p>When lo! a gentle breeze began to rise, <lb/>
            Breathed by obedient Zephyrs round the maid, <lb/>
            Panning her bosom with its softest sighs, <lb/>
            A while among her fluttering robes it strayed, <lb/>
            And boldly sportive latent charms displayed: <lb/>
            And then, as Cupid willed, with tenderest care <lb/>
            From the tall rock, where weeping she was laid, <lb/>
            With gliding motion through the yielding air <lb/>
            To Pleasure's blooming isle their lovely charge they bear.</p>
          <p>On the green bosom of the turf reclined, <lb/>
            They lightly now the astonished virgin lay, <lb/>
            To placid rest they soothe her troubled mind; <lb/>
            Around her still with watchful care they stay, <lb/>
            Around her still in quiet whispers play: <lb/>
            Till lulling slumbers bid her eyelids close, <lb/>
            Veiling with silky fringe each brilliant ray, <lb/>
            While soft tranquillity divinely flows <lb/>
            O'er all her soul serene, in visions of repose.</p>
          <p>Refreshed she rose, and all enchanted gazed <lb/>
            On the rare beauties of the pleasant scene. <lb/>
            Conspicuous far a lofty palace blazed <lb/>
            Upon a sloping bank of softest green; <lb/>
            A fairer edifice was never seenj <lb/>
            The high-ranged columns own no mortal hand, <lb/>
            But seem a temple meet for Beauty's queen. <lb/>
            Like polished snow the marble pillars stand <lb/>
            In grace-attempered majesty sublimely grand.</p><pb n="443"/>
            
          <p>Gently ascending from a silvery flood, <lb/>
            Above the palace rose the shaded hill, <lb/>
            The lofty eminence was crowned with wood, <lb/>
            And the rich lawns, adorn'd by Nature's skill, <lb/>
            The passing breezes with their odours fill; <lb/>
            Hero ever-blooming groves of orange glow, <lb/>
            And here all flowers which from their leaves distil <lb/>
            Ambrosial dew in sweet succession blow, <lb/>
            And trees of matchless size a fragrant shade bestow.</p>
          <p>The sun looks glorious 'mid a sky serene, <lb/>
            And bids bright lustre sparkle o'er the tide; <lb/>
            The clear blue ocean at a distance seen <lb/>
            Bounds the gay landscape on the western side, <lb/>
            While closing round it with majestic pride, <lb/>
            The lofty rocks 'mid citron groves arise; <lb/>
            " Sure some divinity must here reside," <lb/>
            As tranced in some bright vision, Psyche cries, <lb/>
            And scarce believes the bliss, or trusts her charmed eyes.</p>
          <p>When lo! a voice divinely sweet she hears, <lb/>
            From unseen lips proceeds the heavenly sound; <lb/>
            " Psyche, approach, dismiss thy timid fears, <lb/>
            At length his bride thy longing spouse has found, <lb/>
            And bids for thee immortal joys abound; <lb/>
            For thee the palace rose at his command, <lb/>
            For thee his love a bridal banquet crowned; <lb/>
            He bids attendant nymphs around thee stand, <lb/>
            Prompt every wish to serve, a fond obedient band."</p>
          <p>Increasing wonder filled her ravished soul, <lb/>
            For now the pompous portals opened wide, <lb/>
            There, pausing oft, with timid foot she stole <lb/>
            Through halls high domed, enriched with sculptured pride, <lb/>
            While gay saloons appeared on either side, <lb/>
            In splendid vista opening to her sight; <lb/>
            And all with precious gems so beautified, <lb/>
            And furnished with such exquisite delight, <lb/>
            That scarce the beams of heaven emit such lustre bright.</p><pb n="444"/>
            
          <p>The amethyst was there of violet hue, <lb/>
            And there the topaz shed its golden ray, <lb/>
            The chrysoberyl, and the sapphire blue <lb/>
            As the clear azure of a sunny day, <lb/>
            Or the mild eyes where amorous glances play; <lb/>
            The snow-white jasper, and the opal's flame, <lb/>
            The blushing ruby, and the agate grey, <lb/>
            And there the gem which bears his luckless name <lb/>
            Whose death by Phoebus mourned ensured him deathless fame.</p>
          <p>There the green emerald, there cornelians glow, <lb/>
            And rich carbuncles pour eternal light, <lb/>
            With all that India and Peru can shew, <lb/>
            Or Labrador can give so flaming bright <lb/>
            To the charmed mariner's half-dazzled sight: <lb/>
            The coral-paved baths with diamonds blaze : <lb/>
            And all that can the female heart delight <lb/>
            Of fair attire, the last recess displays, <lb/>
            And all that Luxury can ask, her eye surveys.</p>
          <p>Now through the hall melodious music stole, <lb/>
            And self-prepared the splendid banquet stands, <lb/>
            Self-poured the nectar sparkles in the bowl, <lb/>
            The lute and viol touched by unseen hands <lb/>
            Aid the soft voices of the choral bands; <lb/>
            O'er the full board a brighter lustre beams <lb/>
            Than Persia's monarch at his feast commands : <lb/>
            For sweet refreshment all inviting seems <lb/>
            To taste celestial food, and pure ambrosial streams</p>
          <p>But when meek Eve hung out her dewy star, <lb/>
            And gently veiled with gradual hand the sky, <lb/>
            Lo ! the bright folding doors retiring far, <lb/>
            Display to Psyche's captivated eye <lb/>
            All that voluptuous ease could e'er supply <lb/>
            To soothe the spirits in serene repose: <lb/>
            Beneath the velvet's purple canopy <lb/>
            Divinely formed a downy couch arose, <lb/>
            While alabaster lamps a milky light disclose</p><pb n="445"/>
            
          <p>Once more she hears the hymeneal strain; <lb/>
            Far other voices now attune the lay; <lb/>
            The swelling sounds approach, a while remain. <lb/>
            And then retiring faint dissolved away: <lb/>
            The expiring lamps emit a feebler ray, <lb/>
            And soon in fragrant death extinguished lie: <lb/>
            Then virgin terrors Psyche's soul dismay, <lb/>
            When through the obscuring gloom she nought can spy, <lb/>
            But softly rustling sounds declare some Being nigh.</p>
          <p>Oh, you for whom I write ! whose hearts can melt &lt; <lb/>
            At the soft thrilling voice whose power you prove, <lb/>
            You know what charm, unutterably felt, <lb/>
            Attends the unexpected voice of Love : <lb/>
            Above the lyre, the lute's soft notes above, <lb/>
            With sweet enchantment to the soul it steals, <lb/>
            And bears it to Elysium's happy grove; <lb/>
            You best can tell the rapture Psyche feels <lb/>
            When Love's ambrosial lip the vows of Hymen seals.</p>
          <p>“ 'Tis he, 'tis my deliverer! deep imprest <lb/>
            Upon my heart those sounds I well recal," <lb/>
            The blushing maid exclaimed, and on his breast <lb/>
            A tear of trembling ecstasy let fall. <lb/>
            But, ere the breezes of the morning call <lb/>
            Aurora from her purple, humid bed, <lb/>
            Psyche in vain explores the vacant hall, <lb/>
            Her tender lover from her arms is fled, <lb/>
            While sleep his downy wings had o'er her eye-lids spread.</p>
          <p>Again the band invisible attend, <lb/>
            And female voices soothe the mournful bride; <lb/>
            Light hands to braid her hair assistance lend, <lb/>
            By some she sees the glowing bracelet tied, <lb/>
            Others officious hover at her side, <lb/>
            And each bright gem for her acceptance bring, <lb/>
            While some, the balmy air diffusing wide, <lb/>
            Fan softer perfumes from each odorous wing <lb/>
            Than the fresh bosom sheds of earliest, sweetest spring.</p><pb n="446"/>
            
          <p>With songs divine her anxious soul they cheer, <lb/>
            And woo her footsteps to delicious bowers, <lb/>
            They bid the fruit more exquisite appear <lb/>
            Which at her feet its bright profusion showers: <lb/>
            For her they cull unknown, celestial flowers; <lb/>
            - The gilded car they bid her fearless guide, <lb/>
            Which at her wish self moved with wondrous powers <lb/>
            The rapid bird's velocity defied, <lb/>
            While round the blooming isle it rolled with circuit wide.</p>
          <p>Again they spread the feast, they strike the lyre, <lb/>
            But to her frequent questions nought reply, <lb/>
            Her lips in vain her lover's name require, <lb/>
            Or wherefore thus concealed he shuns her eye. <lb/>
            But when reluctant twilight veils the sky, <lb/>
            And each pale lamp successively expires; <lb/>
            Again she trembling hears the voice of joy, <lb/>
            Her spouse a tender confidence inspires, <lb/>
            But with a fond embrace ere dawn again retires.</p>
          <p>To charm the languid hours of solitude <lb/>
            He oft invites her to the Muse's lore, <lb/>
            For none have vainly e'er the Muse pursued, <lb/>
            And those whom she delights, regret no more <lb/>
            The social, joyous hours, while rapt they soar <lb/>
            To worlds unknown, and live in fancy's dream; <lb/>
            Oh, Muse divine! thee only I implore, <lb/>
            Shed on my soul thy sweet inspiring beams, <lb/>
            And pleasure's gayest scene insipid folly seems!</p>
          <p>Silence and solitude the Muses love, <lb/>
            And whom they charm they can alone suffice; <lb/>
            Nor ever tedious hour their votaries prove : <lb/>
            This solace now the lonely Psyche tries, <lb/>
            Or, while her hand the curious needle plies, <lb/>
            She learns from lips unseen celestial strains; <lb/>
            Responsive now with their soft voice she vies, <lb/>
            Or bids her plaintive harp express the pains <lb/>
            Which absence sore inflicts where Love all potent reigns.</p><pb n="447"/>
            
          <p>But melancholy poisons all her joys, <lb/>
            And secret sorrows all her hopes depress, <lb/>
            Consuming languor every bliss destroys, <lb/>
            And sad she droops repining, comfortless. <lb/>
            Her tender lover well the cause can guess, <lb/>
            And sees too plain inevitable fate <lb/>
            Pursue her to the bowers of happiness. <lb/>
            " Oh, Psyche ! most beloved, ere yet too late, <lb/>
            Dread the impending ills and prize thy tranquil state."</p>
          <p>In vain his weeping love he thus advised; <lb/>
            She longs to meet a parent's sweet embrace, <lb/>
            " Oh, were their sorrowinig hearts at least apprised <lb/>
            How Psyche's wondrous lot all fears may chase; <lb/>
            For whom thy love prepared so fair a place ! <lb/>
            Let but my bliss their fond complaints repress, <lb/>
            Let me but once behold a mother's face, <lb/>
            Oh, spouse adored ! and in full happiness <lb/>
            This love-contented heart its solitude shall bless.</p>
          <p>Oh, by those beauties I must ne'er behold! <lb/>
            The spicy-scented ringlets of thine hair: <lb/>
            By that soft neck my loving arms enfold, <lb/>
            Crown with a kind consent thy Psyche's prayer! <lb/>
            Their dear embrace, their blessing let me share; <lb/>
            So shall I stain our couch with tears no more: <lb/>
            But, blest in thee, resign each other care, <lb/>
            Nor seek again thy secret to explore, <lb/>
            Which yet, denied thy sight, I ever must deplore."</p>
          <p>Unable to resist her fond request, <lb/>
            Reluctant Cupid thus at last complied, <lb/>
            And sighing clasped her closer to his breast. <lb/>
            “ Go then, my Psyche ! go, my lovely bride ! <lb/>
            But let me in thy faith at least confide, <lb/>
            That by no subtle, impious arts betrayed, <lb/>
            Which, ah ! too well I know will all be tried, <lb/>
            Thy simply trusting heart shall e'er be swayed <lb/>
            The secret veil to rend which fate thy screen hath made.</p><pb n="448"/>
            
          <p>For danger hovers o'er thy smiling days, <lb/>
            One only way to shield thee yet I know ; <lb/>
            Unseen, I may securely guard thy ways, <lb/>
            And save thee from the threatened storm of woe; <lb/>
            But forced, if known, my Psyche to forego, <lb/>
            Thou never, never must again be mine ! <lb/>
            What mutual sorrows hence must ceaseless flow ! <lb/>
            Compelled thy dear embraces to resign, <lb/>
            While thou to anguish doomed for lost delights shalt pine.</p>
          <p>Solace thy mind with hopes of future joy! <lb/>
            In a dear infant thou shalt see my face ; <lb/>
            Blest mother soon of an immortal boy, <lb/>
            In him his father's features thou shalt trace ! <lb/>
            Yet go ! for thou art free, the bounds of space <lb/>
            Are none for thee : attendant Zephyrs stay, <lb/>
            Speak but thy will, and to the wished-for place <lb/>
            Their lovely mistress swift they shall convey : <lb/>
            Yet hither, ah! return, ere fades the festive day."</p>
          <p>Light of my soul, far dearer than the day!" <lb/>
            (Exulting Psyche cries in grateful joy) <lb/>
            "Me all the bliss of earth could ill repay <lb/>
            For thy most sweet, divine society ; <lb/>
            To thee again with rapture will I fly, <lb/>
            Nor with less pleasure hail the star of eye <lb/>
            Than when in tedious solitude I sigh; <lb/>
            My vows of silent confidence believe, <lb/>
            Nor think thy Psyche's faith will e'er thy love deceive.</p>
          <p>Her suit obtained, in full contentment blest, <lb/>
            Her eyes at length in placid slumbers close. <lb/>
            Sleep, hapless fair! sleep on thy lover's breast; <lb/>
            Ah, not again to taste such pure repose ! <lb/>
            Till thy sad heart by long experience knows <lb/>
            How much they err, who, to their interest blind, <lb/>
            Slight the calm peace which from retirement flows ! <lb/>
            And while they think their fleeting joys to bind, <lb/>
            Banish the tranquil bliss which heaven for man designed</p>

            reconciliation with Venus-Psyche soothed and attended by Inno. <lb/>
            cence—Psyche wandering as described in the opening of the first Canto.</p>
          <p>OR happy you! who, blest with present bliss, <lb/>
            See not with fatal prescience future tears, <lb/>
            Nor the dear moment of enjoyment miss <lb/>
            Through gloomy discontent, or sullen fears <lb/>
            Foreboding many a storm for coming years; <lb/>
            Change is the lot of all. Ourselves with scorn <lb/>
            Perhaps shall view what now so fair appears; <lb/>
            And wonder whence the fancied charm was born <lb/>
            Which now with vain despair from our fond grasp is torn!</p>
          <p>Vain schemer, think not to prolong thy joy! <lb/>
            But cherish while it lasts the heavenly boon; <lb/>
            Expand thy sails! thy little bark shall fly <lb/>
            With the full tide of pleasure! though it soon <lb/>
            May feel the influence of the changeful moon, <lb/>
            It yet is thine ! then let not doubts obscure <lb/>
            With cloudy vapours veil thy brilliant noon, <lb/>
            Nor let suspicion's tainted breath impure <lb/>
            Poison the favouring gale which speeds thy course secure i</p>
          <p>Oh, Psyche, happy in thine ignorance ! <lb/>
            Couldst thou but shun this heart-tormenting bane; <lb/>
            Be but content, nor daringly advance <lb/>
            To meet the bitter hour of threatened pain; <lb/>
            Pure spotless dove! seek thy safe nest again; <lb/>
            Let true affection shun the public eye, <lb/>
            And quit the busy circle of the vain, <lb/>
            For there the treacherous snares concealed lie ; <lb/>
            Oh timely warned escape! to safe retirement fly! <note type="footnote"> G G </note> <pb n="450"/>
            </p>
          <p>Bright shone the morn! and now its golden ray <lb/>
            Dispelled the slumbers from her radiant eyes, <lb/>
            Yet still in dreams her fancy seems to play, <lb/>
            For lo! she sees with rapture and surprise <lb/>
            Full in her view the well-known mansion rise, <lb/>
            And each loved scene of first endearment hails; <lb/>
            The air that first received her infant sighs <lb/>
            With wond'ring ecstasy she now inhales, <lb/>
            While every trembling nerve soft tenderness assails.</p>
          <p>See from the dear pavilion, where she lay, <lb/>
            Breathless she flies with scarce assured feet, <lb/>
            Swift through the garden wings her eager way, <lb/>
            Her mourning parents' ravished eyes to greet. <lb/>
            With loveliest apparition strange and sweet: <lb/>
            Their days of anguish all o'erpaid they deem <lb/>
            By one blest hour of ecstasy so great: <lb/>
            Yet doubtingly they gaze, and anxious seem <lb/>
            To ask their raptured souls, " Oh, is this all a dream ?"</p>
          <p>The wondrous tale attentively they hear, <lb/>
            Repeated oft in broken words of joy, <lb/>
            She in their arms embraced, while every ear <lb/>
            Hangs on their Psyche's lips, and earnestly <lb/>
            On her is fixed each wonder-speaking eye; <lb/>
            Till the sad hour arrives which bids them part, <lb/>
            And twilight darkens o'er the ruddy sky; <lb/>
            Divinely urged they let their child depart, <lb/>
            Pressed with a fond embrace to each adoring heart.</p>
          <p>Trusting that wedded to a spouse divine, <lb/>
            Secure is now their daughter's happiness, <lb/>
            They half contentedly their child resign, <lb/>
            Check the complaint, the rising sigh suppress, <lb/>
            And wipe the silent drops of bitterness. <lb/>
            Nor must she her departure more delay, <lb/>
            But bids them now their weeping Psyche bless; <lb/>
            Then back to the pavilion bends her way, <lb/>
            Ere in the fading west quite sinks expiring day.</p><pb n="451"/>
            
          <p>But, while her parents listen with delight, <lb/>
            Her sisters' hearts the Furies agitate : <lb/>
            They look with envy on a lot so bright, <lb/>
            And all the honours of her splendid fate, <lb/>
            Scorning the meanness of their humbler state; <lb/>
            And how they best her ruin may devise <lb/>
            With hidden rancour much they meditate, <lb/>
            Yet still they bear themselves in artful guise, <lb/>
            While 'mid the feigned caress, concealed the venom lies.</p>
          <p>By malice urged, by ruthless envy stung, <lb/>
            With secret haste to seize their prey they flew, <lb/>
            Around her neck as in despair they clung; <lb/>
            Her soft complying nature well they know. <lb/>
            And trusted by delaying to undo; <lb/>
            But when they found her resolute to go, <lb/>
            Their well-laid stratagem they then pursue, <lb/>
            And, while they bid their treacherous sorrows flow, <lb/>
            Thus fright her simple heart with images of woe.</p>
          <p>" Oh, hapless Psyche ! thoughtless of thy doom! <lb/>
            Yet hear thy sisters who have wept for thee. <lb/>
            Since first a victim to thy living tomb,. <lb/>
            Obedient to the oracle's decree, <lb/>
            Constrained we left thee to thy destiny. <lb/>
            Since then no comfort could our woes abate ; <lb/>
            While thou wert lulled in false security <lb/>
            We learned the secret horrors of thy fate, <lb/>
            And heard prophetic lips thy future ills relate.</p>
          <p>Yet fearing never to behold thee more, <lb/>
            Our filial care would fain the truth conceal; <lb/>
            But from the sages' cell this ring we bore, <lb/>
            With power each latent magic to reveal; <lb/>
            Some hope from hence our anxious bosoms feel <lb/>
            That we from ruin may our Psyche save, <lb/>
            Since Heaven, propitious to our pious zeal, <lb/>
            Thee to our frequent prayers in pity gave, <lb/>
            That warned thou yet mayst shun thy sad untimely grave.</p><pb n="452"/>
            
          <p>Oh! how shall we declare the fatal truth ? <lb/>
            How wound thy tender bosom with alarms ? <lb/>
            Tell how the graces of thy blooming youth, <lb/>
            Thy more than mortal, all-adored charms <lb/>
            Have lain enamoured in a sorcerer's arms ? <lb/>
            Oh, Psyche! seize on this decisive hour, <lb/>
            Escape the mischief of impending harms! <lb/>
            Return no more to that enchanted bower, <lb/>
            Fly the magician's arts, and dread his cruel power.</p>
          <p>If, yet reluctant to forego thy love, <lb/>
            Thy furtive joys and solitary state, <lb/>
            Our fond officious care thy doubts reprove, <lb/>
            At least let some precaution guard thy fate, <lb/>
            Nor may our warning love be prized too late; <lb/>
            This night thyself thou mayst convince thine eyes, <lb/>
            Hide but a lamp, and cautiously await <lb/>
            Till in deep slumber thy magician lies, <lb/>
            This ring shall then disclose his foul deformities.</p>
          <p>That monster by the oracle foretold, <lb/>
            Whose cursed spells both gods and men must fear, <lb/>
            In his own image thou shalt then behold, <lb/>
            And shuddering hate what now is prized so dear; <lb/>
            Yet fly not then, though loathsome he appear, <lb/>
            But let this dagger to his breast strike deep; <lb/>
            Thy coward terrors then thou must not hear, <lb/>
            For if with life he rouses from that sleep <lb/>
            Nought then for thee remains, and we must hopeless weep."</p>
          <p>Oh! have you seen, when in the northern sky <lb/>
            The transient flame of lambent lightning plays, <lb/>
            In quick succession lucid streamers fly, <lb/>
            Now flashing roseate, and now milky rays, <lb/>
            While struck with awe the astonished rustics gaze ? <lb/>
            Thus o'er her cheek the fleeting signals move, <lb/>
            Now pale with fear, now glowing with the blaze <lb/>
            Of much indignant, still confiding love, <lb/>
            Now horror's lurid hue with shame's deep blushes strove.</p><pb n="453"/>
            
          <p>On her cold, passive hand the ring they place, <lb/>
            And hide the dagger in her folding vest; <lb/>
            Pleased the effects of their dire arts to trace <lb/>
            In the mute agony that swells her breast, <lb/>
            Already in her future ruin blest: <lb/>
            Conscious that now their poor deluded prey <lb/>
            Should never taste again delight or rest, <lb/>
            But sickening in suspicion's gloom decay, <lb/>
            Or urged by terrors rash their treacherous will obey.</p>
          <p>While yet irresolute with sad surprise, <lb/>
            'Mid doubt and love she stands in strange suspense, <lb/>
            Lo ! gliding from her sisters' wondering eyes <lb/>
            Returning Zephyrs gently bear her thence; <lb/>
            Lost all her hopes, her joys, her confidence, <lb/>
            Back to the earth her mournful eyes she threw, <lb/>
            As if imploring pity and defence; <lb/>
            While bathed in tears her golden tresses flew, <lb/>
            As in the breeze dispersed they caught the precious dew.</p>
          <p>Illumined bright now shines the splendid dome, <lb/>
            Melodious accents her arrival hail: <lb/>
            But not the torches' blaze can chase the gloom, <lb/>
            And all the soothing powers of music fail; <lb/>
            Trembling she seeks her couch with horror pale, <lb/>
            But first a lamp conceals in secret shade, <lb/>
            While unknown terrors all her soul assail. <lb/>
            Thus half their treacherous counsel is obeyed, <lb/>
            For still her gentle soul abhors the murderous blade.</p>
          <p>And now, with softest whispers of delight, <lb/>
            Love welcomes Psyche still more fondly dear; <lb/>
            Not unobserved, though hid in deepest night, <lb/>
            The silent anguish of her secret fear. <lb/>
            He thinks that tenderness excites the tear <lb/>
            By the late image of her parents' grief, <lb/>
            And half offended seeks in vain to cheer, <lb/>
            Yet, while he speaks, her sorrows feel relief, <lb/>
            Too soon more keen to sting from this suspension brief!</p><pb n="454"/>
            
          <p>Allowed to settle on celestial eyes <lb/>
            Soft Sleep exulting now exerts his sway, <lb/>
            From Psyche's anxious pillow gladly flies <lb/>
            To veil those orbs, whose pure and lambent ray <lb/>
            The powers of heaven submissively obey. <lb/>
            Trembling and breathless then she softly rose, <lb/>
            And seized the lamp, where it obscurely lay, <lb/>
            With hand too rashly daring to disclose <lb/>
            The sacred veil which hung mysterious o'er her woes.</p>
          <p>Twice, as with agitated step she went, <lb/>
            The lamp expiring shone with doubtful gleam, <lb/>
            As though it warned her from her rash intent: <lb/>
            And twice she paused, and on its trembling beam <lb/>
            Gazed with suspended breath, while voices seem <lb/>
            With murmuring sound along the roof to sigh; <lb/>
            As one just waking from a troublous dream, <lb/>
            With palpitating heart and straining eye, <lb/>
            Still fixed with fear remains, still thinks the danger nigh.</p>
          <p>Oh, daring Muse! wilt thou indeed essay <lb/>
            To paint the wonders which that lamp could shew? <lb/>
            And canst thou hope in living words to say <lb/>
            The dazzling glories of that heavenly view ? <lb/>
            Ah ! well I ween, that if with pencil true <lb/>
            That splendid vision could be well exprest, <lb/>
            The fearful awe imprudent Psyche knew <lb/>
            Would seize with rapture every wondering breast, <lb/>
            When Love's all-potent charms divinely stood contest.</p>
          <p>All imperceptible to human touch, <lb/>
            His wings display celestial essence light, <lb/>
            The clear effulgence of the blaze is such, <lb/>
            The brilliant plumage shines so heavenly bright <lb/>
            That mortal eyes turn dazzled from the sight; <lb/>
            A youth he seems in manhood's freshest years; <lb/>
            Round his fair neck, as clinging with delight, <lb/>
            Each golden curl resplendently appears, <lb/>
            Or shades his darker brow, which grace majestic wears.</p><pb n="455"/>
            
          <p>Or o'er his guileless front the ringlets bright <lb/>
            Their rays of sunny lustre seem to throw, <lb/>
            That front than polished ivory more white ! <lb/>
            His blooming cheeks with deeper blushes glow <lb/>
            Than roses scattered o'er a bed of snow: <lb/>
            While on his lips, distilled in balmy dews, <lb/>
            (Those lips divine that even in silence know <lb/>
            The heart to touch) persuasion to infuse <lb/>
            Still hangs a rosy charm that never vainly sues.</p>
          <p>The friendly curtain of indulgent sleep <lb/>
            Disclosed not yet his eyes' resistless sway, <lb/>
            But from their silky veil there seemed to peep <lb/>
            Some brilliant glances with a softened ray, <lb/>
            Which o'er his features exquisitely play, <lb/>
            And all his polished limbs suffuse with light. <lb/>
            Thus through some narrow space the azure day <lb/>
            Sudden its cheerful rays diffusing bright, <lb/>
            Wide darts its lucid beams, to gild the brow of night</p>
          <p>His fatal arrows and celestial bow <lb/>
            Beside the couch were negligently thrown, <lb/>
            Nor needs the god his dazzling arms, to show <lb/>
            His glorious birth, such beauty round him shone <lb/>
            As sure could spring from Beauty's self alone ; <lb/>
            The gloom which glowed o'er all of soft desire, <lb/>
            Could well proclaim him Beauty's cherished son ; <lb/>
            And beauty's self will oft these charms admire, <lb/>
            And steal his witching smile, his glance's living free.</p>
          <p>Speechless with awe, in transport strangely lost, <lb/>
            Long Psyche stood with fixed adoring eye ; <lb/>
            Her limbs immoveable, her senses tost <lb/>
            Between amazement, fear, and ecstasy, <lb/>
            She hangs enamoured o'er the Deity. <lb/>
            Till from her trembling hand extinguished falls <lb/>
            The fatal lamp-He starts-and suddenly <lb/>
            Tremendous thunders echo through the halls, <lb/>
            While ruin's hideous crash bursts o'er the affrighted walls.</p><pb n="456"/>
            
          <p>Dread horror seizes on her sinking heart, <lb/>
            A mortal chillness shudders at her breast, <lb/>
            Her soul shrinks fainting from death's icy dart, <lb/>
            The groan scarce uttered dies but half exprest, <lb/>
            And down she sinks in deadly swoon opprest: <lb/>
            But when at length, awaking from her trance, <lb/>
            The terrors of her fate stand all confessed, <lb/>
            In vain she casts around her timid glance, <lb/>
            The rudely frowning scenes her former joys enhance.</p>
          <p>No traces of those joys, alas, remain! <lb/>
            A desert solitude alone appears. <lb/>
            No verdant shade relieves the sandy plain, <lb/>
            The wide-spread waste no gentle fountain cheers, <lb/>
            One barren face the dreary prospect wears; <lb/>
            Nought through the vast horizon meets her eye <lb/>
            To calm the dismal tumult of her fears, <lb/>
            No trace of human habitation nigh, <lb/>
            A sandy wild beneath, above a threatening sky.</p>
          <p>The mists of morn yet chill the gloomy air, <lb/>
            And heavily obscure the clouded skies; <lb/>
            In the mute anguish of a fixed despair <lb/>
            Still on the ground immoveable she lies; <lb/>
            At length, with lifted hands and streaming eyes, <lb/>
            Her mournful prayers invoke offended Love, <lb/>
            " Oh, let me hear thy voice once more," she cries, <lb/>
            " In death at least thy pity let me move, <lb/>
            And death, if but forgiven, a kind relief will prove.</p>
          <p>" For what can life to thy lost Psyche give, <lb/>
            What can it offer but a gloomy void ? <lb/>
            Why thus abandoned should I wish to live ? <lb/>
            To mourn the pleasure which I once enjoyed, <lb/>
            The bliss my own rash folly hath destroyed; <lb/>
            Of all my soul most prized, or held most dear, <lb/>
            Nought but the sad remembrance doth abide, <lb/>
            And late repentance of my impious fear; <lb/>
            Remorse and vain regret what living soul can bear!</p><pb n="457"/>
            
          <p>“ Oh, art thou then indeed for ever gone! <lb/>
            And art thou heedless of thy Psyche's woe ! <lb/>
            From these fond arms for ever art thou flown, <lb/>
            And unregarded must my sorrows flow! <lb/>
            Ah ! why too happy did I ever know <lb/>
            The rapturous charms thy tenderness inspires ? <lb/>
            Ah ! why did thy affections stoop so low ? <lb/>
            Why kindle in a mortal breast such fires, <lb/>
            Or with celestial love inflame such rash desires ?</p>
          <p>" Abandoned thus for ever by thy love, <lb/>
            No greater punishment I now can bear, <lb/>
            From fate no farther malice can I prove; <lb/>
            Not all the horrors of this desert drear, <lb/>
            Nor death itself can now excite a fear; <lb/>
            The peopled earth a solitude as vast <lb/>
            To this despairing heart would now appear; <lb/>
            Here, then, my transient joys for ever past, <lb/>
            Let thine expiring bride thy pardon gain at last!"</p>
          <p>Now prostrate on the bare unfriendly ground, <lb/>
            She waits her doom in silent agony; <lb/>
            When lo ! the well-known soft celestial sound <lb/>
            She hears once more with breathless ecstasy, <lb/>
            " Oh! yet too dearly loved! Lost Psyche! Why <lb/>
            With cruel fate wouldst thou unite thy power, <lb/>
            And force me thus thine arms adored to fly ? <lb/>
            Yet cheer thy drooping soul, some happier hour <lb/>
            Thy banished steps may lead back to thy lover's bower.</p>
          <p>“ Though angry Venus we no more can shun, <lb/>
            Appease that anger and I yet am thine! <lb/>
            Lo ! where her temple glitters to the sun; <lb/>
            With humble penitence approach her shrine, <lb/>
            Perhaps to pity she may yet incline; <lb/>
            But should her cruel wrath these hopes deceive, <lb/>
            And thou, alas ! must never more be mine, <lb/>
            Yet shall thy lover ne'er his Psyche leave, <lb/>
            But, if the fates allow, unseen thy woes relieve.</p><pb n="458"/>
            
          <p>" Stronger than I, they now forbid my stay; <lb/>
            Psyche beloved, adieu!" Scarce can she hear <lb/>
            The last faint words, which gently melt away; <lb/>
            And now more faint the dying sounds appear, <lb/>
            Borne to a distance from her longing ear; <lb/>
            Yet still attentively she stands unmoved, <lb/>
            To catch those accents which her soul could cheer, <lb/>
            That soothing voice which had so sweetly proved <lb/>
            That still his tender heart offending Psyche loved!</p>
          <p>And now the joyous sun had cleared the sky, <lb/>
            The mist dispelled revealed the splendid fane; <lb/>
            A palmy grove majestically high <lb/>
            Screens the fair building from the desert plain; <lb/>
            Of alabaster white and free from stain <lb/>
            'Mid the tall trees the tapering columns rose; <lb/>
            Thither, with fainting steps, and weary pain, <lb/>
            Obedient to the voice at length she goes, <lb/>
            And at the threshold seeks protection and repose.</p>
          <p>Round the soft scene immortal roses bloom, <lb/>
            While lucid myrtles in the breezes play; <lb/>
            No savage beast did ever yet presume <lb/>
            With foot impure within the grove to stray, <lb/>
            And far from hence flies every bird of prey; <lb/>
            Thus, 'mid the sandy Garamantian wild, <lb/>
            When Macedonia's lord pursued his way, <lb/>
            The sacred temple of great Ammon smiled, <lb/>
            And green encircling shades the long fatigue beguileds</p>
          <p>With awe that fearfully her doom awaits <lb/>
            Still at the portal Psyche timid lies, <lb/>
            When lo! advancing from the hallowed gates <lb/>
            Trembling she views with reverential eyes <lb/>
            An aged priest. A myrtle bough supplies <lb/>
            A wand, and roses bind his snowy brows ; <lb/>
            " Bear hence thy feet profane, (he sternly cries,) <lb/>
            Thy longer stay the goddess disallows, <lb/>
            Fly, nor her fiercer wrath too daringly arouse.!"</p><pb n="459"/>
            
          <p>His pure white. robe imploringly she held, <lb/>
            And, bathed in tears, embraced his sacred knees; <lb/>
            Her mournful charms relenting he beheld, <lb/>
            And melting pity in his eye she sees; <lb/>
            "Hope not.(he cries) the goddess to appease, <lb/>
            Retire at awful distance from her shrine, <lb/>
            But seek the refuge of those sheltering trees, <lb/>
            And now thy soul with humble awe incline <lb/>
            To hear her sacred will, and mark the words divine.</p>
          <p>“ Presumptuous Psyche! whose aspiring soul <lb/>
            The God of Love has dared to arrogate; <lb/>
            Rival of Venus! whose supreme control <lb/>
            Is now asserted by all-ruling fate, <lb/>
            No suppliant tears her vengeance shall abate <lb/>
            Till thou hast raised an altar to her power, <lb/>
            Where perfect happiness, in lonely state, <lb/>
            Has fixed her temple in secluded bower, <lb/>
            By foot impure of man untrodden to this hour!</p>
          <p>" And on the altar must thou place an urn <lb/>
            Filled from immortal Beauty's sacred spring, <lb/>
            Which foul deformity to grace can turn, <lb/>
            And back to fond affection's eyes can bring <lb/>
            The charms which fleeting fled on transient wing; <lb/>
            Snatched from the rugged steep where first they rise, <lb/>
            Dark rocks their crystal source overshadowing, <lb/>
            Let their clear water sparkle to the skies <lb/>
            Where cloudless lustre beams which happiness supplies!</p>
          <p>" To Venus thus for ever reconciled, <lb/>
            (This one atonement all her wrath disarms), <lb/>
            From thy loved Cupid then no more exiled <lb/>
            There shalt thou, free from sorrow and alarms, <lb/>
            Enjoy for ever his celestial charms. <lb/>
            But never shalt thou taste a pure repose, <lb/>
            Nor ever meet thy lover's circling arms, <lb/>
            Till, all subdued that shall thy steps oppose, t <lb/>
            Thy perils there shall end, escaped from all thy foes."</p><pb n="460"/>
            
          <p>With meek submissive woe she heard her doom, <lb/>
            Nor to the holy minister replied; <lb/>
            But in the myrtle grove's mysterious gloom <lb/>
            She silently retired her grief to hide. <lb/>
            Hopeless to tread the waste without a guide, <lb/>
            All unrefreshed and faint from toil she lies: <lb/>
            When lo! her present wants are all supplied, <lb/>
            Sent by the hand of Love a turtle flies, <lb/>
            And sets delicious food before her wondering eyes.</p>
          <p>Cheered by the favouring omen, softer tears <lb/>
            Relieve her bosom from its cruel weight: <lb/>
            She blames the sad despondence of her fears, <lb/>
            When still protected by a power so great, <lb/>
            His tenderness her toils will mitigate. <lb/>
            Then with renewed strength at length she goes, <lb/>
            Hoping to find some skilled in secret fate, <lb/>
            Some learned sage, who haply might disclose <lb/>
            Where lay that blissful bower, the end of all her woes.</p>
          <p>And as she went, behold, with hovering flight <lb/>
            The dove preceded still her doubtful way; <lb/>
            Its spotless plumage of the purest white, <lb/>
            Which shone resplendent in the blaze of day, <lb/>
            Could even in darkest gloom a light display; <lb/>
            Of heavenly birth, when first to mortals given <lb/>
            Named Innocence. But ah! too short its stay; <lb/>
            By ravenous birds it fearfully was driven <lb/>
            Back to reside with Love, a denizen of heaven.</p>
          <p>Now through the trackless wild, o'er many a mile <lb/>
            The messenger of Cupid led the fair,. <lb/>
            And cheered with hope her solitary toil, <lb/>
            Till now a brighter face the prospects wear. <lb/>
            Past are the sandy wastes and deserts bare, <lb/>
            And many a verdant hill, and grassy dale, <lb/>
            And trace, that mortal culture might declare, <lb/>
            And many a wild wood dark, and joyous vale <lb/>

          <p>But other fears her timid soul distress, <lb/>
            'Mid strangers unprotected and alone, <lb/>
            The desert wilderness alarmed her less <lb/>
            Than cities, thus unfriended and unknown ; <lb/>
            But where the path was all by moss o'ergrown, <lb/>
            There still she chose her solitary way, <lb/>
            Where'er her faithful Dove before had flown <lb/>
            Fearful of nought she might securely stray, <lb/>
            For still his care supplied the wants of every day,</p>
          <p>And still she entered every sacred grove <lb/>
            And homage paid to each divinity, <lb/>
            But chief the altar of almighty Love <lb/>
            Weeping embraced with fond imploring eye; <lb/>
            To every oracle her hopes apply, <lb/>
            Instructions for her dangerous path to gain : <lb/>

          <p>And now, remote from every peopled town, <lb/>
            One sultry day a cooling bower she found: <lb/>
            There, as I whilom sung, she laid her down, <lb/>
            Where rich profusion of gay flowers around <lb/>
            Had decked with artless shew the sloping ground; <lb/>
            There the wild rose and modest violet grow, <lb/>
            There all thy charms, Narcissus! still abound : <lb/>
            There wrapt in verdure fragrant lilies blow, <lb/>
            Lilies that love the vale, and hide their bells of snow.</p>
          <p>Thy flowers, Adonis! bright vermilion shew; <lb/>
            Still for his love the yellow Crocus pines ; <lb/>
            There, while indignant blushes seem to glow, <lb/>
            Beloved by Phoebus his Acanthus shines; <lb/>
            Reseda still her drooping head reclines <lb/>
            With faithful homage to his golden rays, <lb/>
            And, though 'mid clouds their lustre he resigns, <lb/>
            An image of the constant heart displays, <lb/>
            While silent still she turns her fond pursuing gaze.</p><pb n="462"/>

            Scatters in thy green path, enchanting May! <lb/>
            And every flowering shrub there clustering stands <lb/>
            As though they wooed her to a short delay, <lb/>
            Yielding a charm to sooth here weary way; <lb/>
            Soft was the tufted moss, and sweet the breeze, <lb/>
            With lulling sound the murmuring waters play, <lb/>
            With lulling sound from all the rustling trees <lb/>
            The fragrant gale invites to cool refreshing ease.</p>
          <p>There as she sought repose, her sorrowing heart <lb/>
            Recalled her absent love with bitter sighs; <lb/>
            Regret had deeply fixed the poisoned dart, <lb/>
            Which ever rankling in her bosom lies ; <lb/>
            In vain she seeks to close her weary eyes, <lb/>
            Those eyes still swim incessantly in tears, <lb/>
            Hope in her cheerless bosom fading dies, <lb/>
            Distracted by a thousand cruel fears, <lb/>
            While banished from his love for ever she appears.</p>
          <p>Oh! thou best comforter of that sad heart <lb/>
            Whom fortune's spite assails; come, gentle Sleep, <lb/>
            The weary mourner soothe! for well the art <lb/>
            Thou knowest in soft forgetfulness to steep <lb/>
            The eyes which sorrow taught to watch and weep; <lb/>
            Let blissful visions now her spirits cheer, <lb/>
            Or lull her cares to peace in slumbers deep, <lb/>
            Till, from fatigue refreshed and anxious fear, <lb/>
            Hope, like the, morning star, once more ehall re-appear.</p><pb n="463"/>

          <p>PRAISE of Love—Psyche's Champion, with his attendant Constance, <lb/>
            described-The Knight assumes the command of Passion, who appears <lb/>
            as a Lion-Psyche proceeds under the protection of the Knight-Per­ <lb/>
            suaded to repose in the Bower of loose Delight-Her escape from <lb/>
            thence-Led by Innocence to Retirement-Psyche meets Vanity and <lb/>
            Flattery-Betrayed by them into the power of Ambition-Rescued by <lb/>
            her Knight.</p>
          <p>On, who art thou who darest of Love complain ? <lb/>
            He is a gentle spirit and injures none! <lb/>
            His foes are ours; from them the bitter pain, <lb/>
            The keen, deep anguish, the heart-rending groan, <lb/>
            Which in his milder reign are never known. <lb/>
            His tears are softer than the April showers, <lb/>
            White-handed Innocence supports his throne, <lb/>
            His sighs are sweet as breath of earliest flowers, <lb/>
            Affection guides his steps, and peace protects his bowers.</p>
          <p>But scarce admittance he on earth can find, <lb/>
            Opposed by vanity, by fraud ensnared, <lb/>
            Suspicion frights him from the gloomy mind, <lb/>
            And jealousy in vain his smiles has shared, <lb/>
            Whose sullen frown the gentle godhead scared; <lb/>
            From passion's rapid blaze in haste he flies, <lb/>
            His wings alone the fiercer flame has spared; <lb/>
            From him ambition turns his scornful eyes, <lb/>
            And avarice, slave to gold, a generous lord denies.</p>
          <p>But chief Inconstancy his power destroys; <lb/>
            To mock his lovely form, an idle train <lb/>
            With magic skill she dressed in transient toys, <lb/>
            By these the selfish votaries she can gain <lb/>
            Whom Love's more simple bands could ne'er detain. <lb/>
            Ah ! how shall Psyche through such mortal foes <lb/>
            The fated end of all her toils attain ? <lb/>
            Sadly she ponders o'er her hopeless woes, <lb/>
            Till on the pillowy turf she sinks to short repose.</p><pb n="464"/>
            
          <p>But, as the careless lamb, whom playful chance, <lb/>
            Thoughtless of danger, has enticed to rove, <lb/>
            Amidst her gambols casts a sudden glance <lb/>
            Where lurks her wily foe within the grove, <lb/>
            Anxious to fly, but still afraid to move, <lb/>
            All hopeless of escape--so looks the maid, <lb/>
            Such dread her half-awakened senses prove, <lb/>
            When roused from sleep before her eyes dismayed <lb/>
            A knight all armed appears close 'mid the embowering shade.</p>
          <p>Trembling f'he gazed, until the stranger knight, <lb/>
            Tempering with mildest courtesy the awe <lb/>
            Which majesty inspired, low in her sight <lb/>
            Obeisance made ; nor would he nearer draw, <lb/>
            Till, half subdued surprise and fear, he saw <lb/>
            Pale terror yielding to the rosy grace, <lb/>
            The pure congealed blood begin to thaw, <lb/>
            And flowing through her crystal veins apace <lb/>
            Suffuse with mantling blush her mild celestial face.</p>
          <p>Gently approaching then with fairest speech <lb/>
            He proffered service to the lonely dame, <lb/>
            And prayed her that she might not so impeach <lb/>
            The honour of his youth's yet spotless fame, <lb/>
            As aught to fear which might his knighthood shame; <lb/>
            But if her unprotected steps to guard, <lb/>
            The glory of her champion he might claim, <lb/>
            He asked no other guerdon or reward, <lb/>
            Than what bright honour's self might to his deeds award.</p>
          <p>Doubting, and musing much within her mind, <lb/>
            With half-suspicious, half-confiding eye, <lb/>
            A while she stood; her thoughts bewildered find <lb/>
            No utterance, unwilling to deny <lb/>
            Such proffered aid, yet bashful to reply <lb/>
            With quick assent, since though concealed his face <lb/>
            Beneath his helm, yet might she well espy <lb/>
            And in each fair proportion plainly trace <lb/>
            The symmetry of form, and perfect youthful grace.</p><pb n="465"/>
            
          <p>Hard were it to describe the nameless charm <lb/>
            That o'er each limb, in every action played, <lb/>
            The softness of that voice, which could disarm <lb/>
            The hand of fury of its deadly blade; <lb/>
            In shining armour was the youth arrayed, <lb/>
            And on his shield a bleeding heart he bore, <lb/>
            His lofty crest light plumes of azure shade, <lb/>
            There shone a wounded dragon bathed in gore, <lb/>
            And bright with silver beamed the silken scarf he wore.</p>
          <p>His milk-white steed with glittering trappings blazed, <lb/>
            Whose reins a beauteous boy attendant held, <lb/>
            On the fair squire with wonder Psyche gazed, <lb/>
            For scarce he seemed of age to bear the shield, <lb/>
            Far less a ponderous lance, or sword to wield; <lb/>
            Yet well this little page his lord had served, <lb/>
            His youthful arm had many a foe repelled, <lb/>
            His watchful eye from many a snare preserved, <lb/>
            Nor ever from his steps in any danger swerved.</p>
          <p>Graced with the gift of a perpetual youth, <lb/>
            No lapse of years had power his form to change; <lb/>
            Constance was named the boy, whose matchless truth, <lb/>
            Though oft enticed with other lords to range, <lb/>
            Nor fraud, nor force could from that knight estrange; <lb/>
            His mantle of celestial blue was made, <lb/>
            And its blight texture wrought with art so strange <lb/>
            That the fresh brilliant gloss could never fade, <lb/>
            And lustre yet unknown to Psyche's eyes displayed.</p>
          <p>Thus while she gazed, behold with horrid roar <lb/>
            A lion from the neighbouring forest rushed, <lb/>
            A golden chain around his neck he bore, <lb/>
            Which richly glowing with carbuncles blushed, <lb/>
            While his fierce eye-balls fiery rage had flushed: <lb/>
            Forth steps the youth before the affrighted fair, <lb/>
            Who in his mighty paw already crushed <lb/>
            Seems in the terrors of her wild despair, <lb/>
            And her mute quivering lips a death-like paleness wear. <note type="footnote"> H H </note> <pb n="466"/>
            </p>
          <p>But scarce the kingly beast the knight beheld, <lb/>
            When crouching low, submissive at his feet, <lb/>
            His wrath extinguished, and his valour quelled, <lb/>
            He seemed with reverence and obedience sweet <lb/>
            Him as his long-acknowledged lord to greet. <lb/>
            While, in acceptance of the new command, <lb/>
            Well pleased the youth received the homage meet, <lb/>
            Then seized the splendid chain with steady hand, <lb/>
            Full confident to rule, and every foe withstand.</p>
          <p>And, when at length recovered from her fear, <lb/>
            The timid Psyche mounts his docile steed, <lb/>
            Much prayed, she tells to his attentive ear <lb/>
            (As on her purposed journey they proceed) <lb/>
            The doubtful course the oracle decreed: . <lb/>
            And how, observant of her friendly guide, <lb/>
            She still pursued its flight, with all the speed <lb/>
            Her fainting strength had hitherto supplied: <lb/>
            What pathless wilds she crossed! What forests dai kling wide!</p>
          <p>Which having heard, the courteous knight began. <lb/>
            With counsel sweet to soothe her wounded heart; <lb/>
            Divinely eloquent, persuasion ran <lb/>
            The herald of his words ere they depart <lb/>
            His lips, which well might confidence impart <lb/>
            As he revealed how he himself was bound <lb/>
            By solemn vow, that neither force nor art <lb/>
            His helmet should unloose, till he had found <lb/>
            The bower of happiness, that long-sought fairy ground.</p>
          <p>" I too (he said) divided from my love, <lb/>
            The offended power of Venus deprecate, <lb/>
            Like thee, through paths untrodden, sadly rove <lb/>
            In search of that fair spot prescribed by fate, <lb/>
            The blessed term of my afflicted state, <lb/>
            Where I the mistress of my soul shall find, <lb/>
            For whose dear sake no toil to me seems great, <lb/>
            Nor any dangers to my search assigned <lb/>
            Can from its purpose fright my ardent longing mind.</p><pb n="467"/>
            
          <p>" Psyche ! thy soft and sympathising heart <lb/>
            Shall share, the rapture of thy loyal knight; <lb/>
            He too, in thy content shall bear a part, <lb/>
            Blest witness of thy new-restored delight; <lb/>
            My vows of true allegiance here I plight, <lb/>
            Ne'er to forsake thee till thy perils end, <lb/>
            Thy steps to guard, in thy protection fight, <lb/>
            By counsel aid, and by my arm defend, <lb/>
            And prove myself in all, thy champion and thy friend”</p>
          <p>So on they went, her cheerless heart revived <lb/>
            By promised succour in her doubtful way ; <lb/>
            And much- of hope she to herself derived, <lb/>
            From the warm eagerness his lips display <lb/>
            In their pursuit to suffer no delay: <lb/>
            " And sure, (she softly sighed) my dearest Lord. <lb/>
            Thy watchful love still guides me as I stray, <lb/>
            Not chance alone could such an aid afford, <lb/>
            Lo I beasts of prey confess the heaven-assisted sword."</p>
          <p>Now from his crystal urn, with chilling hand, <lb/>
            Vesper had sprinkled all the earth with dew, <lb/>
            A misty veil obscured the neighbouring land, <lb/>
            And shut the fading landscape from their view ; <lb/>
            A beaten path they eagerly pursue, <lb/>
            (For now refreshment and repose they need,. <lb/>
            As Psyche weary of long travel grew,) <lb/>
            Where by a river's bank it seemed to lead, <lb/>
            Along its sinuous course they heedlessly proceed.</p>
          <p>At length the lordly beast that bore the knight <lb/>
            Explored the river's depth with sudden bound: <lb/>
            Psyche, who heard the plunge with strange affright, <lb/>
            Her champion re-assured with welcome sound, <lb/>
            That he the other bank had safely found; <lb/>
            And, while he spoke, emerging from the shade, <lb/>
            A joyous goodly train appear around, <lb/>
            Of many a gallant youth and white robed maid, <lb/>
            Who grateful welcome gave, and courteous greeting paid <note type="footnote"> H H 2 </note> <pb n="468"/>
            </p>
          <p>Quick through the trees a thousand torches blazed <lb/>
            The gloom to banish, and the scene disclose <lb/>
            To Psyche, all irresolute, amazed: <lb/>
            A bridge with stately arch at distance rose, <lb/>
            Thither at once the. gay assembly goes, <lb/>
            Not unattended by the charmed knight, <lb/>
            Inviting Psyche to partake repose, <lb/>
            Pointing where shone their bower illumined bright, <lb/>
            Their bower so passing fair, the bower of loose Delight.</p>
          <p>At length with timid foot the bridge she past, <lb/>
            And to her guardian knight clung fearfully, <lb/>
            While many a doubting glance around she cast, <lb/>
            If still her watchful dove she might espy; <lb/>
            Feebly it seemed on labouring wing to fly, <lb/>
            Till, dazzled by the sudden glare around, <lb/>
            In painful trance it closed its dizzy eye, <lb/>
            And had it not fair Psyche's bosom found, <lb/>
            Its drooping pinion soon had touched the unhallowed ground.</p>
          <p>Hence there arose within her heart sore dread <lb/>
            Which no alluring pleasure could dispel; <lb/>
            The splendid hall with luscious banquet spread, <lb/>
            The soft-breathed flutes which in sweet concert swell, <lb/>
            With melody of song unspeakable ; <lb/>
            Nor the light dancing troop in roses drest, <lb/>
            Could chase the terrors which she dared not tell. <lb/>
            While, fondly cherished in her anxious breast, <lb/>
            She strove in vain to soothe the fluttering bird to rest.</p>
          <p>On a soft downy couch the guests are placed, <lb/>
            And close behind them stands their watchful page, <lb/>
            But much his strict attendance there disgraced, <lb/>
            And much was scorned his green and tender age, <lb/>
            His calm fixed eye, and steady aspect sage: <lb/>
            But him nor rude disdain, nor mockery, <lb/>
            Nor soothing blandishments could e'er engage <lb/>
            The wanton mazes of their sports to try, <lb/>
            Or from his lord to turn his firm adhering eye.</p><pb n="469"/>
            
          <p>White-bosomed nymphs around with loosened zones <lb/>
            All on the guests obsequiously tend, <lb/>
            Some sing of love with soft expiring tones, <lb/>
            While Psyche's melting eyes the strain commend; <lb/>
            Some o'er their heads the canopy suspend, <lb/>
            Some hold the sparkling bowl, while some with skill <lb/>
            Ambrosial showers and balmy juices blend, <lb/>
            Or the gay lamps with liquid odours fill, <lb/>
            Whose many-coloured fires divinest sweets distil.</p>
          <p>And now a softer light they seemed to shed, <lb/>
            And sweetest music ushered in their queen : <lb/>
            Her languid steps by winged boys are led, <lb/>
            Who in their semblance might have Cupids been; <lb/>
            Close wrapt in veils her following train was seen; <lb/>
            Herself looked lovely in her loose attire, <lb/>
            Her smiling eyes gave lustre to the scene, <lb/>
            And still, where'er they turned their wanton fire, <lb/>
            Each thrilling nerve confessed the rapture they inspire.</p>
          <p>The stranger guests she viewed with welcome glad, <lb/>
            And crowned the banquet with reception sweet, <lb/>
            To fill the glowing bowl her nymphs she bad, <lb/>
            And graceful rising from her splendid seat, <lb/>
            She would herself present the sparkling treat; <lb/>
            When lo! the dove, alarmed, with sudden start, <lb/>
            Spurned the bright cup, and dashed it at her feet, <lb/>
            For well he knew 'twas mixed with treacherous art <lb/>
            To sting his Psyche's breast with agonizing smart.</p>
          <p>Regardless of her supplicating tears, <lb/>
            Each eye with vengeful rage the insult sees, <lb/>
            Her knight's protection now in vain appears; <lb/>
            The offended sovereign anxious to appease, <lb/>
            A thousand hands prepare the dove to seize; <lb/>
            Nor was this all, for as the tumult rose, <lb/>
            Sudden more thick than swarm of summer bees, <lb/>
            The secret dens their venomed hoards disclose, <lb/>
            And horror at the sight her vital spirits froze.</p><pb n="470"/>
            
          <p>Hissing aloud with undulations dire, <lb/>
            Their forked tongues unnumbered serpents show, <lb/>
            Their tainted breath emitting poisonous fire, <lb/>
            All turn on Psyche as their mortal foe. <lb/>
            But he, whose arm was never weak or slow, <lb/>
            Now rushed before her with resistless spring, <lb/>
            On either side the oft-repeated blow <lb/>
            Repulsed the malice of their deadly sting, <lb/>
            While sparks of wrathful fire from their fierce jaws they fling,</p>
          <p>" Fly, Psyche! these are slander's hellish brood ! <lb/>
            Contest I know is vain," her champion cried. <lb/>
            Her passage now the opposing train withstood; <lb/>
            Struck with disgust their hideous forms she spied, <lb/>
            For lo ! each silken veil is thrown aside, <lb/>
            And foul deformity, and filth obscene, <lb/>
            With monstrous shapes appear on every side; <lb/>
            But vanished is their fair and treacherous queen, <lb/>
            And with her every charm that decked the enchanted scene</p>
          <p>Meanwhile the dove had soared above their reach, <lb/>
            But hovered still in anxious Psyche's sight; <lb/>
            Precursor of escape, it seemed to teach <lb/>
            Whither she safest might direct her flight, <lb/>
            And find a passport in her foes despight; <lb/>
            One rugged path there lay with briars o'ergrown, <lb/>
            Then dark and dismal with the shades of night, <lb/>
            Thither the dove on rapid wing had flown, <lb/>
            Conspicuous 'mid the gloom its silver plumage shone.</p>
          <p>Yet she delayed, o'ercome by terror's power, <lb/>
            And scarce her fainting form the knight could shield, <lb/>
            When lo! still active in the trying hour, <lb/>
            Constance rushed fearless through the dreadful field, <lb/>
            With breast-plate firm invulnerably steeled, <lb/>
            He heeded not the storms which round him press, <lb/>
            To any perils he disdained to yield, <lb/>
            Endued with prudence as with hardiness, <lb/>
            And ever skilled to bring due succour in distress.</p><pb n="471"/>
            
          <p>to! swift returning on his master's steed, <lb/>
            In his right hand he held the lion's chain, <lb/>
            The mighty beast his gentleness could lead, <lb/>
            Though little used to bear the curb or rein, <lb/>
            And 'mid those groves accustomed to remain, <lb/>
            Yet now prepared, with sweet submissive grace, <lb/>
            He ready stands the knight to bear again, <lb/>
            While trembling Psyche on the steed they place, <lb/>
            Which swift as lightning flies far from the dreadful chase.</p>
          <p>Rough was the rude wild way, and many a thorn <lb/>
            Tore her loose garments in their rapid flight- <lb/>
            O'er many a league the panting fair is borne, <lb/>
            Till now, emerging from the shades of night, <lb/>
            The grey-eyed morn stole forth her pallid light. <lb/>
            Then first she paused, unable to proceed, <lb/>
            Exhausted with fatigue, and pain, and fright. <lb/>
            " Turn, Psyche," cried the youth, "relax thy speed, <lb/>
            And see thyself at length from thy pursuers freed."</p>
          <p>'Mid the thick forest was a lonely dell, <lb/>
            Where foot of man was seldom known to tread, <lb/>
            The sloping hills all round in graceful swell <lb/>
            The little green with woods environed; <lb/>
            Hither the dove their passive course had led: <lb/>
            Here the thin smoke blue rising 'mid the trees, <lb/>
            Where broad and brown the deepest umbrage spread <lb/>
            Spoke the abode of safe retired ease, <lb/>
            And Psyche gladly there her dove descending sees.</p>
          <p>In lowly cottage, walled with mossy sod, <lb/>
            Close by a little spring's perpetual rill, <lb/>
            A hermit dwelt, who many a year had trod <lb/>
            With sacred solitude that pine-clad hill, <lb/>
            And loved with holy images to fill <lb/>
            His soul enrapt; yet courteous then besought <lb/>
            A while secluded here to rest; and still <lb/>
            Replete with kind and hospitable thought, <lb/>
            To a sequestered bower the weary Psyche brought.</p><pb n="472"/>
            
          <p>Skilled in the virtue of each healing flower, <lb/>
            And the wild fruit's restoring juice to blend, <lb/>
            He spreads the frugal fare of wholesome power, <lb/>
            And heedfully his cares their wants attend; <lb/>
            A docile ear to his advice they lend, <lb/>
            And sage instruction from his precepts take, <lb/>
            Which much their future journey may befriend; <lb/>
            Wisdom with soothing eloquence he spake, <lb/>
            Pleased to resolve their doubts, and all their cares partake.</p>
          <p>In those sweet placid scenes a while they rest, <lb/>
            Till Psyche finds her fainting strength revive; <lb/>
            And here her dove, as in a quiet nest, <lb/>
            Delighted seems to sportive joy alive; <lb/>
            And hence they surest confidence derive. <lb/>
            He plumes his wings, and through his swelling throat <lb/>
            (No more a ruffled, fearful fugitive) <lb/>
            In gentle murmurs pours his dulcet note, <lb/>
            While Psyche listening sits in some still vale remote.</p>
          <p>Oh! have you never known the silent charm <lb/>
            That undisturbed retirement yields the soul, <lb/>
            Where no intruder might your peace alarm, <lb/>
            And tenderness hath wept without control, <lb/>
            While melting fondness o'er the bosom stole ? <lb/>
            Did fancy never, in some lonely grove, <lb/>
            Abridge the hours which must in absence roll ? <lb/>
            Those pensive pleasures did you never prove, <lb/>
            Oh, you have never loved! you know not what is love!</p>
          <p>They do not love who can to these prefer <lb/>
            The tumult of the gay, or folly's roar; <lb/>
            The Muse they know not; nor delight in her <lb/>
            Who can the troubled soul to rest restore, <lb/>
            Calm Contemplation: Yes, I must deplore <lb/>
            Their joyless state, even more than his .who mourns <lb/>
            His love for ever lost; delight no more <lb/>
            Unto his widowed heart indeed returns, <lb/>
            Yet, while he weeps, his soul their cold indifference spurns.</p><pb n="473"/>
            
          <p>But'if soft hope illumines fancy's dream, <lb/>
            Assuring him of love and constancy, <lb/>
            How exquisite do then the moments seem, <lb/>
            When he may hide himself from every eye, <lb/>
            And cherish the dear thought in secrecy ! <lb/>
            While sweet remembrance soothes his thrilling heart, <lb/>
            And brings once more past hours of kindness nigh, <lb/>
            Recals the look of love when forced to part, <lb/>
            And turns to drops of joy the tears that sadly start.</p>
          <p>Forgetful of the dangers of her way, <lb/>
            Imagination oft would Psyche bear <lb/>
            To her long travel's end, and that blest day <lb/>
            When Love unveiled should to her eyes appear; <lb/>
            When she might view his charms exempt from fear, <lb/>
            Taste his pure kisses, feel his balmy sighs, <lb/>
            Rest in the fond embrace of arms so dear, <lb/>
            Gaze with soft rapture on his melting eyes, <lb/>
            And hear his voice divine, the music of the skies 1</p>
          <p>Their destined course impatient to achieve, <lb/>
            The knight is urgent onward to proceed: <lb/>
            Cheered with recruited strength, they take their leave <lb/>
            Of their kind host, and pay their grateful meed <lb/>
            Of warmest thanks sincere ; onward they speed <lb/>
            Their sunless journey long through forests green, <lb/>
            And tangled thickets rank with many a weed ; <lb/>
            And when at closing day a hut is seen, <lb/>
            They seek the humble roof, nor scorn its welcome mean.</p>
          <p>It happened once that, early roused from sleep, <lb/>
            (Ere her damp veil the virgin Morn had cast <lb/>
            From her pale face, not yet with blushes deep <lb/>
            Lovely suffused, as when approaching fast <lb/>
            His herald star proclaims her spouse at last) <lb/>
            Psyche, forsaking soon her homely bed, <lb/>
            Alone had fearless the low threshold past, <lb/>
            And, to beguile the hours which lingering fled, <lb/>
            Light o'er the dewy plain walked forth with nimble tread.</p><pb n="474"/>
            
          <p>Yet though the knight close wrapped in slumber lay, <lb/>
            Her steps, at distance, still the page pursued, <lb/>
            Fearful that danger might befal her way, <lb/>
            Or lest, entangled in the mazy wood, <lb/>
            Returning she should miss the pathway rude. <lb/>
            The lark now hails the sun with rapturous song, <lb/>
            The cheerful earth resounds with gratitude, <lb/>
            O'er the gay scene as Psyche tript along, <lb/>
            She felt her spirits rise, her lightened heart grow strong.</p>
          <p>And hark, soft music steals upon the ear ! <lb/>
            'Tis woman's voice most exquisitely sweet! <lb/>
            Behold two female forms approaching near <lb/>
            Arrest with wonder Psyche's timid feet; <lb/>
            On a gay car, by speckled panthers fleet <lb/>
            Is drawn in gallant state a seeming queen, <lb/>
            And at her foot, on low but graceful seat, <lb/>
            A gentle nymph of lovely form is seen, <lb/>
            In robe of fairest white, with scarf of pleasant green.</p>
          <p>In strains of most bewitching harmony, <lb/>
            And still adapted to her sovereign's praise, <lb/>
            She filled the groves with such sweet melody, <lb/>
            That, quite o'ercome with rapture and amaze, <lb/>
            Psyche stood listening to the warbled lays; <lb/>
            Yet with a sullen, scarce approving ear <lb/>
            Her mistress sits, but with attentive gaze <lb/>
            Her eyes she fixes on a mirror clear, <lb/>
            Where still by fancy's spell unrivalled charms appear.</p>
          <p>And, as she looked with aspect ever new, <lb/>
            She seemed on change and novel grace intent, <lb/>
            Her robe was formed of ever-varying hue, <lb/>
            And whimsically placed each ornament; <lb/>
            On her attire, with rich luxuriance spent, <lb/>
            The treasures of the earth, the sea, the air, <lb/>
            Are vainly heaped her wishes to content; <lb/>
            Yet were her arms and snowy bosom bare, <lb/>
            And both in painted pride shone exquisitely fair.</p><pb n="475"/>
            
          <p>Her braided tresses in profusion drest, <lb/>
            Circled with diadem, and nodding plumes, <lb/>
            Sported their artful ringlets o'er her breast, <lb/>
            And to the breezes gave their rich perfumes; <lb/>
            Her cheek with tint of oorrowed roses blooms ! <lb/>
            Used to receive from all rich offerings, <lb/>
            She quaffs with conscious right the fragrant fumes <lb/>
            Which her attendant from a censer flings, <lb/>
            Who graceful feeds the flame with incense while she sings.</p>
          <p>Soon as her glance fair Psyche's form had caught, <lb/>
            Her soft attendant smiling she addressed : <lb/>
            "Behold, Lusinga! couldst thou e'er have thought <lb/>
            That these wild woods were so in beauty blest ? <lb/>
            Let but that nymph in my attire be drest, <lb/>
            And scarce her loveliness will yield to mine ! <lb/>
            At least invite her in our bower to rest, <lb/>
            Before her eyes let all my splendour shine, <lb/>
            Perhaps to dwell with us her heart we may incline."</p>
          <p>With softest smile applauding all she heard, <lb/>
            Lusinga bowing left her golden seat, <lb/>
            And Psyche, who at first in doubt had feared <lb/>
            While listening to the lay so silver sweet, <lb/>
            Now passive followed with unconscious feet; <lb/>
            Till Constance, all alarmed, impatient flew, <lb/>
            And soft his whispers of the maid entreat <lb/>
            To fly the Syren's song, for well he knew <lb/>
            What lurking dangers hence would to his Lord ensue.</p>
          <p>" Oh, do not trust her treacherous lips," he cried, <lb/>
            " She is the subtle slave of Vanity, <lb/>
            Her queen, the child of folly, and of pride, <lb/>
            To lure thee to her power each art will try, <lb/>
            Nor ever will release thee peacably." <lb/>
            He spoke, but spoke in vain, for lo ! from far, <lb/>
            Of giant port they fast approaching spy <lb/>
            A knight, high mounted on a glittering car, <lb/>
            From whose conspicuous crest flames wide a dazzling star</p><pb n="476"/>
            
          <p>" Psyche escape! Ambition is at hand !" <lb/>
            The page exclaims: while swift as thought he flies; <lb/>
            She would have followed, but with parley bland <lb/>
            Lusinga soon her terrors pacifies. <lb/>
            " Fair nymph, ascend my car," the sovereign cries, <lb/>
            " I will convey thee where thy wishes lead, <lb/>
            Haply the safest course I may advise <lb/>
            How thou thy journey mayst perform with speed; <lb/>
            For ne'er in woods to dwell such beauty was decreed."</p>
          <p>So gently urgent her consent they wooed <lb/>
            With much persuasion of the stranger knight, <lb/>
            That yielding Psyche now no more withstood, <lb/>
            But, pointing out to her observant sight <lb/>
            The humble cot where she had passed the night, <lb/>
            She prayed her kind conductress there to turn, <lb/>
            And promised to herself what vast delight <lb/>
            Her wondering knight would feel at her return, <lb/>
            And with what blushing shame the timid page would burn.</p>
          <p>But scarcely had she climbed the fatal car, <lb/>
            When swifter than the wind the panthers flew, <lb/>
            The traversed plains and woods, receding far, <lb/>
            Soon shut from trembling Psyche's anxious view <lb/>
            The spot where she had left her guardian true; <lb/>
            With desperate efforts, all in vain she tries <lb/>
            To escape the ills which now too sure she knew <lb/>
            Must from her ill-placed confidence arise; <lb/>
            Betrayed-Ah! self-betrayed, a wretched sacrifice.</p>
          <p>She strove to quit the car with sudden bound, <lb/>
            Ah, vain attempt! she now perceived too late <lb/>
            A thousand silken trammels, subtly wound <lb/>
            O'er her fair form, detained her as she sate: <lb/>
            Lost in despair she yields to her sad fate, <lb/>
            And silent hears, but with augmented fright, <lb/>
            The queen describe her brother's splendid state, <lb/>
            'Vho now outstripped them by his rapid flight, <lb/>

          <p>High o'er the spacious plain a mountain rose, <lb/>
            A stately castle on its summit stood: <lb/>
            Huge craggy cliffs behind their strength oppose <lb/>
            To the rough surges of the dashing flood; <lb/>
            The rocky shores a boldly rising wood <lb/>
            On either side conceals; bright shine the towers, <lb/>
            And seem to smile upon the billows rude. <lb/>
            In front the eye, with comprehensive powers, <lb/>
            Sees wide-extended plains enriched with splendid bowers.</p>
          <p>Hither they bore the sad reluctant fair, <lb/>
            Who mounts with dizzy eye the awful steep; <lb/>
            The blazing structure seems high poised in air, <lb/>
            And its light pillars tremble o'er the deep: <lb/>
            As yet the heavens are calm, the tempests sleep, <lb/>
            She knows not half the horrors of her fate: <lb/>
            Nor feels the approaching ruin's whirlwind sweep : <lb/>
            Yet with ill-boding fears she past the gate, <lb/>
            And turned with sickening dread from scenes of gorgeous state.</p>
          <p>In vain the haughty master of the hall <lb/>
            Invites her to partake his regal throne, <lb/>
            With cold indifference she looks on all <lb/>
            The gilded trophies, and the well-wrought stone <lb/>
            Which in triumphal arches proudly shone: <lb/>
            And as she casts around her timid eye, <lb/>
            Back to her knight her trembling heart is flown, <lb/>
            And many an anxious wish, and many a sigh, <lb/>
            Invokes his gallant arm protection to supply.</p>
          <p>Sudden the lurid heavens obscurely frown, <lb/>

            Flattery's soft voice the howling tempests drown, <lb/>

            And all its insecure foundations blame : <lb/>
            Tumultuously they rush: the chief aghast <lb/>
            Beholds his throne overturned, his train dispersing fast.</p><pb n="478"/>

            Urged by the impetuous youth the lion prest, <lb/>
            And gaining fast upon his flight, at length <lb/>
            Prepared his daring progress to arrest, <lb/>
            And seized with furious jaw his struggling breast; <lb/>
            Gasping he loosed his hold-and Psyche lost <lb/>
            The overwhelming wave with ruin had opprest, <lb/>
            But Constance, ever near when needed most, <lb/>
            The sinking beauty caught, and bore her to the coast.</p>
          <p>Stung with the shame of the relinquished prey, <lb/>
            Mad with revenge, and hate, and conscious pride, <lb/>
            The knight, recovered from his short dismay, <lb/>
            Dashes resistless through the foaming tide; <lb/>
            The billows yielding to his arm divide, <lb/>
            As rushing on the youth he seeks the shore; <lb/>
            But now a combat strange on either side <lb/>
            Amid the waves begins; each hopes no more <lb/>
            The engulphing deep his foe shall e'er to light restore,</p>
          <p>Beside the cold inhospitable lands, <lb/>
            Where suns long absent dawn with lustre pale, <lb/>
            Thus on his bark the bold Biscayan stands, <lb/>
            And bids his javelin rouse the parent whale : <lb/>
            Fear, pain, and rage at once her breast assail, <lb/>
            The agitated ocean foams around, <lb/>
            Lashed by the sounding fury of her tail, <lb/>
            Or as she mounts the surge with frightful bound, <lb/>
            Wide echoing to her cries the bellowing shores resound.</p><pb n="480"/>
            
          <p>Fierce was the contest, but at length subdued, <lb/>
            The youth exulting sees his giant foe. <lb/>
            With wonder still the enormous limbs he viewed, <lb/>
            Which lifeless now the waves supporting show. <lb/>
            His starred helm, that now was first laid low, <lb/>
            He seized as trophy of the wonderous fight, <lb/>
            And bade the sparkling gem on Constance glow, <lb/>
            While Psyche's eyes, soft beaming with delight, <lb/>
            Through tears of grateful praise applaud her gallant knight.</p>

          <p>FULL gladsome was my heart ere while to tell <lb/>

            For ah! too oft his sterner power could quell <lb/>
            The mild affections which more gently move, <lb/>
            And rather silent fled than with him strove : <lb/>
            For Love content and tranquil saw with dread <lb/>
            The busy scenes Ambition's schemes approve, <lb/>
            And, by the hand of Peace obscurely led, <lb/>
            From pride of public life disgusted ever fled.</p>
          <p>There are who know not the delicious charm <lb/>

            And courts may lure them with each splendid toy : <lb/>
            But ne'er may vanity or thirst of fame <lb/>

          <p>Blest Psyche! thou hast 'scaped the tyrant's power! <lb/>
            Thy gentle heart shall never know the pain <lb/>
            Which tortures Pride in his most prosperous hour: <lb/>
            Yet dangers still unsung for thee remain; <lb/>
            Nor must thou unmolested hope to gain <lb/>
            Immortal beauty's never-failing spring; <lb/>
            Oh! no-nor yet tranquillity attain: <lb/>
            But though thy heart the pangs of doubt may sting, <lb/>
            Thy faithful knight shall yet thy steps in safety bring.</p>
          <p>Warned by late peril now she scarcely dares <lb/>
            Quit for one moment his protecting eye: <lb/>
            Sure in his sight, her soul of nought despairs, <lb/>
            And nought looks dreadful when that arm is nigh <lb/>
            On which her hopes with confidence rely; <lb/>
            By his advice their constant course they bend, <lb/>
            He points where hidden danger they should fly, <lb/>
            On him securely, as her heaven-sent friend, <lb/>
            She bids her grateful heart contentedly depend.</p>
          <p>Oh! who the exquisite delight can tell, <lb/>
            The joy which mutual confidence imparts ? <lb/>
            Or who can paint the charm unspeakable <lb/>
            Which links in tender bands two faithful hearts ? <lb/>
            In vain assailed by fortune's envious darts, <lb/>
            Their mitigated woes are sweetly shared, <lb/>
            And doubled joy reluctantly departs : <lb/>
            Let but the sympathising heart be spared, <lb/>
            What sorrow seems not light, what peril is not dared ?</p>
          <p>Oh ! never may suspicion's gloomy sky <lb/>
            Chill the sweet glow of fondly trusting love ! <lb/>
            Nor ever may he feel the scowling eye <lb/>
            Of dark distrust his confidence reprove! <lb/>
            In pleasing error may I rather rove, <lb/>
            With blind reliance on the hand so dear, <lb/>
            Than let cold prudence from my eyes remove <lb/>
            Those sweet delusions, where nor doubt nor fear <lb/>
            Nor foul disloyalty nor cruel change appear. <note type="footnote"> I I </note> <pb n="482"/>
            </p>
          <p>The noble mind is ever prone to trust; <lb/>
            Yet love with fond anxiety is joined ; <lb/>
            And timid tenderness is oft unjust; <lb/>
            The coldness which it dreads too prompt to find, <lb/>
            And torture the too susceptible mind. <lb/>
            Hence rose the gloom which oft o'er Psyche stole <lb/>
            Lest he she loved, unmindful or unkind, <lb/>
            Should careless slight affection's soft control, <lb/>
            Or she long absent lose her influence o'er his soul.</p>
          <p>'Twas evening, and the shades which sudden fell <lb/>
            Seemed to forebode a dark unlovely night; <lb/>
            The sighing wood-nymphs from their caves foretel <lb/>
            The storm which soon their quiet shall affright; <lb/>
            Nor cheering star nor moon appears in sight, <lb/>
            Nor taper twinkles through the rustling leaves, <lb/>
            And sheds afar its hospitable light: <lb/>
            But hark ! a dismal sound the ear receives, <lb/>
            And through the obscuring gloom the eye strange forms per- <lb/>
            [ceives.</p>
          <p>It was a helpless female who exclaimed, <lb/>
            Whose blind and aged form an ass sustained: <lb/>
            Misshaped and timorous, of light ashamed, <lb/>
            In darksome woods her hard-earned food she gained, <lb/>
            And her voracious appetite maintained, <lb/>
            Though all-devouring, yet unsatisfied ; <lb/>
            Nor aught of hard digestion she disdained, <lb/>
            Whate'er was offered greedily she tried, <lb/>
            And meanly served, as slave, whoever food supplied.</p>
          <p>A cruel monster now her steps pursued, <lb/>
            Well known of yore, and named the Blatant Beast, <lb/>
            And soon he seized his prey with grasp so rude, <lb/>
            So fiercely on her feeble body prest, <lb/>
            That had the courteous knight not soon released <lb/>
            Her unresisting limbs from violence, <lb/>
            She must have sunk by his rough jaws opprest: <lb/>
            The spiteful beast, enraged at the defence, <lb/>
            Now turned upon the knight with foaming vehemence.</p><pb n="483"/>
            
          <p>But, when his fury felt the couched spear, <lb/>
            On Psyche's unarmed form he bellowing flew ; <lb/>
            'Twas there alone the knight his rage could fear; <lb/>
            Swifter than thought his flaming sword he drew, <lb/>
            And from his hand the doubtful javelin threw, <lb/>
            Lest erring it might wound the trembling fair: <lb/>
            Eager the cruel monster to subdue, <lb/>
            He scorned to use his shield's protecting care, <lb/>
            And rashly left his side in part exposed and bare.</p>
          <p>Sharp were the wounds of his avenging steel, <lb/>
            Which forced the roaring beast to quit the field: <lb/>
            Yet ere he. fled, the knight unused to feel <lb/>
            „ The power of any foe, or e'er to yield <lb/>
            To any arm which sword or spear could wield, <lb/>
            Perceived the venom of his tooth impure; <lb/>
            But, with indignant silence, unrevealed <lb/>
            The pain he bore, while through the gloom obscure <lb/>
            The beast, in vain pursued, urged on his flight secure.</p>
          <p>And now the hag, delivered from her fear, <lb/>
            Her grateful thanks upon the knight bestowed, <lb/>
            And, as they onward went, in Psyche's ear <lb/>
            Her tongue with many a horrid tale o'erflowed, <lb/>
            Which warned her to forsake that venturous road, <lb/>
            And seek protection in the neighbouring grove; <lb/>
            Where dwelt a prudent dame, who oft bestowed <lb/>
            Her sage advice, when pilgrims doomed to rove, <lb/>
            Benighted there, had else with lurking dangers strove.</p>
          <p>The knight now softly bade his charge beware, <lb/>
            Nor trust Credulity, whom well he knew; <lb/>
            Yet he himself, harassed with pain and care, <lb/>
            And heedful of the storm which fiercer grew, <lb/>
            Yielded, a path more sheltered to pursue: <lb/>
            Now soon entangled in a gloomy maze, <lb/>
            Psyche no longer has her knight in view, <lb/>
            Nor sees his page's star-crowned helmet blaze; <lb/>
            Close at her side alone the hag loquacious strays. <note type="footnote"> n2 </note> <pb n="484"/>
            </p>
          <p>Fearful she stops, and calls aloud in vain, <lb/>
            The storm-roused woods roar only in reply ; <lb/>
            Anxious her loved protector to regain, <lb/>
            She trembling listens to Credulity, <lb/>
            Who points where they a glimmering light may spy ; <lb/>
            Which, through the shade of intervening trees, <lb/>
            And all the misty blackness of the sky, <lb/>
            Casting a weak and dubious ray she sees, <lb/>
            And fain by this would seek her terrors to appease.</p>
          <p>Yet hoping that, allured by that same light <lb/>
            1 Which singly seemed through all the gloom to shine, <lb/>
            She there at last might meet her wandering knight, <lb/>
            Thither her footsteps doubtingly incline, <lb/>
            As best the uncertain path they could divine, <lb/>
            All tangled as it wound through brake and briar : <lb/>
            While to affright her soul at once combine <lb/>
            A thousand shapeless forms of terror dire- <lb/>
            Here shrieks the ill-omened bird, there glares the meteor's fire.</p>
          <p>In the deep centre of the mazy wood, <lb/>
            With matted ivy and wild vine o'ergrown, <lb/>
            A Gothic castle solitary stood, <lb/>
            With massive walls built firm of murky stone; <lb/>
            Long had Credulity its mistress known, <lb/>
            Meagre her form and tawny was her hue, <lb/>
            Unsociably she lived, unloved, alone, <lb/>
            No cheerful prospects gladdened e'er her view, <lb/>
            And her pale hollow eyes oblique their glances threw.</p>
          <p>Now had they reached the sad and dreary bower <lb/>
            Where dark Disfida held her gloomy state : <lb/>
            The grated casements strong with iron power, <lb/>
            The huge port-cullis creaking o'er the gate, <lb/>
            The surly guards that round the draw-bridge wait, <lb/>
            Chill Psyche's heart with sad foreboding fears ; <lb/>
            Nor "ever had she felt so desolate <lb/>
            As when at length her guide the porter hears, <lb/>
            And at the well-known call reluctantly appears.</p><pb n="485"/>
            
          <p>la hall half lighted with uncertain rays, <lb/>
            Such as expiring tapers transient shed, <lb/>
            The gloomy princess sat, no social blaze <lb/>
            The unkindled hearth supplied, no table spread <lb/>
            Cheered the lone guest who weetless wandered, <lb/>
            But melancholy silence reigned around, <lb/>
            While on her arm she leaned her pensive head, <lb/>
            And anxious watched, as sullenly she frowned, <lb/>
            Of distant whispers low to catch the doubtful sound.</p>
          <p>Startled to hear an unaccustomed noise, <lb/>
            Sudden she rose, and on the intruders bent <lb/>
            Her prying eye askance; but soon the voice <lb/>
            Of her old slave appeased her discontent, <lb/>
            And a half-welcome to her guests she lent: <lb/>
            Her frequent questions satisfied at last, <lb/>
            Through all the neighbouring woods her scouts she sent <lb/>
            To seek the knight, while Psyche's tears flowed fast, <lb/>
            And all the live-long night in anxious woe she past.</p>
          <p>The sullen bell had told the midnight hour, <lb/>
            And sleep had laid the busy world to rest, <lb/>
            All but the watchful lady of that bower <lb/>
            And wretched Psyche . her distracted breast <lb/>
            The agony of sad suspense opprest, <lb/>

            And now the wished-for voice her fancy blest: <lb/>
            Alas! the screaming night-bird only cries; <lb/>
            Only the drear obscure there meets her straining eyes.</p>
          <p>Has thy heart sickened with deferred hope ? <lb/>
            Or felt the impatient anguish of suspense ? <lb/>
            Or hast thou tasted of the bitter cup <lb/>

            Thou knowest the poison which o'erflowed from hence <lb/>
            O'er Psyche's tedious, miserable hours. <lb/>
            The unheeded notes of plaintive Innocence <lb/>
            No longer soothe her soul with wonted powers, <lb/>
            While false Disfida's tales her listening ear devours.</p><pb n="486"/>

            Of ruffians rushing from their secret dens, <lb/>
            Of foul magicians and of wizard spell, <lb/>
            The poisoned lance and net invisible; <lb/>
            While Psyche shuddering sees her knight betrayed <lb/>
            Into the snares of some enchanter fell, <lb/>
            Beholds him bleeding in the treacherous shade, <lb/>
            Or hears his dying voice implore in vain for aid.</p>
          <p>At length the cruel messengers return, <lb/>
            Their trampling steeds sound welcome in her ear; <lb/>
            Her rapid feet the ground impatient spurn, <lb/>
            As eagerly she flies their news to hear. <lb/>
            Alas! they bring no tidings which may cheer <lb/>
            Her sorrowing soul opprest, disconsolate! <lb/>
            " Dismiss," they cry, " each idly timid fear! <lb/>

            Till sudden bursting forth in angry mood <lb/>
            Disfida gave her indignation vent. <lb/>
            " Ah, well I know," she cried, " that wicked brood <lb/>

            Forbad the utterance of a single sigh, <lb/>

            Soon as the morn's first light shall clear the skies." <lb/>
            She ceased, then languishing her griefs to feed, <lb/>
            Her cold dark chamber sought, from observation freed.</p>
          <p>'Twas there regret indulged the bitter tear; <lb/>
            She feels herself forsaken and alone: <lb/>
            "Behold," she cries, " fulfilled is every fear, <lb/>
            Oh! wretched Psyche, now indeed undone! <lb/>
            Thy love's protecting care no more is shown, <lb/>
            He bids his servant leave thee to thy fate, <lb/>
            Nor longer will the hopeless wanderer own: <lb/>
            Some fairer, nobler spouse, some worthier mate, <lb/>
            At length by Venus given, shall share his heavenly state.</p><pb n="488"/>
            
          <p>• " Oh! most adored! Oh! most regretted love! <lb/>
            Oh! joys that never must again be mine, <lb/>
            And thou, lost hope, farewell !-vainly I rove, <lb/>
            For never shall I reach that land divine, <lb/>
            Nor ever shall thy beams celestial shine <lb/>
            Again upon my sad unheeded way ! <lb/>
            Oh ! let me here with life my woes resign, <lb/>
            Or in this gloomy den for ever stay, <lb/>
            And shun the scornful world, nor see detested day,</p>
          <p>" But no ! those scenes are hateful to mine eyes, <lb/>
            And all who spoke or witnessed my disgrace; <lb/>
            My soul with horror from this dwelling flies, <lb/>
            And seeks some tranquil, solitary place, <lb/>
            Where grief may finish life's unhappy race!" <lb/>
            So past she the long night, and soon as Morn <lb/>
            Had first begun to show his cheerful face, <lb/>
            Her couch, which care had strewn with every thorn, <lb/>
            With heavy heart she left, disquieted, forlorn.</p>
          <p>Not thus Disfida suffered her to part, <lb/>
            But urged her there in safety to remain, <lb/>
            Repeating oft to her foreboding heart, <lb/>
            That fairy land she never could attain : <lb/>
            But when she saw dissuasion was in vain, <lb/>
            And Psyche bent her journey to pursue, <lb/>
            With angry brow she called a trusty train, <lb/>
            And bade them keep the imprudent fair in view, <lb/>
            And guard her dangerous path with strict observance true.</p>
          <p>In vain their proffered service she declines, <lb/>
            And dreads the convoy of the scowling band; <lb/>
            Their hateful presence with her loss combines, <lb/>
            She feels betrayed to the destroyer's hand, <lb/>
            And trembling wanders o'er the dreary land; <lb/>
            While as she seeks to escape Disfida's power, <lb/>
            Her efforts still the officious guards withstand, <lb/>
            Led in vain circles many a tedious hour, <lb/>
            Undistanced still she sees the gloomy turrets lower.</p><pb n="489"/>
            
          <p>Till, wearied with her fruitless way, at length <lb/>
            Upon the ground her fainting limbs she threw; <lb/>
            No wish remained to aid exhausted strength, <lb/>
            The mazy path she cared not to pursue, <lb/>
            Since unavailing was the task she knew: <lb/>
            Her murmuring guards to seek for food prepare, <lb/>
            Yet mindful of their charge, still keep in view <lb/>
            The drooping victim of their cruel care, <lb/>
            Who sees the day decline in terror and despair. '</p>
          <p>Hark ! a low hollow groan she seems to hear <lb/>
            Repeated oft; wondering she looks around : <lb/>
            It seems to issue from some cavern near, <lb/>
            Or low hut hidden by the rising ground; <lb/>
            For, though it seemed the melancholy sound <lb/>
            Of human voice, no human form was nigh; <lb/>
            Her eye no human habitation found, <lb/>
            But as she listening gazed attentively, <lb/>
            Her shuddering ears received the deep and long-drawn sigh.</p>
          <p>The guard who nearest stood now whispering said, <lb/>
            "If aught of doubt remain within thy mind, <lb/>
            Or wish to know why thus thou wert betrayed, <lb/>
            Or what strange cause thy faithless knight inclined <lb/>
            To leave the charge he with such scorn resigned, <lb/>
            Each curious thought thou now mayst satisfy, <lb/>
            Since here the entrance of a cave we find, <lb/>
            Where dwells, deep hid from day's too garish eye, <lb/>
            A sage whose magic skill can solve each mystery."</p>
          <p>He staid not her reply, but urged her on <lb/>
            Reluctant to the dark and dreary cave; <lb/>
            No beam of cheerful Heaven had ever shone <lb/>
            In the recesses of that gloomy grave, <lb/>
            Where screaming owls their daily dwelling crave. <lb/>
            One sickly lamp the wretched Master shewed; <lb/>
            Devouring fiend ! Who now the prey shall save <lb/>
            From his fell gripe, whose hands in blood imbrued, <lb/>
            In his own bosom seek his lacerated food ?</p><pb n="490"/>
            
          <p>On the damp ground he sits in sullen woe, <lb/>
            But wildly rolls around his frenzied eye, <lb/>
            And gnaws his withered lips, which still o'erfiow <lb/>
            With bitter gall; in foul disorder lie <lb/>
            His black and matted locks; anxiety <lb/>
            Sits on his wrinkled brow and sallow cheek; <lb/>
            The wasted form, the deep-drawn, frequent sigh, <lb/>
            Some slow-consuming malady bespeak, <lb/>
            But medicinal skill the cause in vain shall seek.</p>
          <p>"Behold," the treacherous guard exclaimed, " behold) <lb/>
            At length Disfida sends thy promised bride ! <lb/>
            Let her, deserted by her knight, be told <lb/>
            What peerless lady lured him from her side; <lb/>
            Thy cares her future safety must provide." <lb/>
            Smiling maliciously as thus he spoke, <lb/>
            He seemed her helpless anguish to deride; <lb/>
            Then swiftly rushing from the den he broke, <lb/>
            Ere from the sudden shock astonished she awoke.</p>
          <p>She too had fled; but when the wretch escaped <lb/>
            He closed the cavern's mouth with cruel care; <lb/>
            And now the monster placed his form mis-shaped <lb/>
            To bar the passage of the affrighted fair: <lb/>
            Her spirits die, she breathes polluted air, <lb/>
            And vaporous visions swim before her sight: <lb/>
            His magic skill the sorcerer bids her share, <lb/>
            And lo! as in a glass, she sees her knight <lb/>
            In bower remembered well, the bower of loose Delight.</p>
          <p>But oh! what words her feelings can impart! <lb/>
            Feelings to hateful envy near allied! <lb/>
            While on her knight her anxious glances dart: <lb/>
            His plumed helmet, lo! he lays aside; <lb/>
            His face with torturing agony she spied, <lb/>
            Yet cannot from the sight her eyes remove ; <lb/>
            No mortal knight she sees had aid supplied, <lb/>
            No mortal knight in her defence had strove; <lb/>
            'Twas Love! 'twas Love himself, her own adored Love.</p><pb n="491"/>
            
          <p>Poured in soft dalliance at a lady's feet, <lb/>
            In fondest rapture he appeared to lie, <lb/>
            While her fair neck with inclination sweet <lb/>
            Bent o'er his graceful form her melting eye, <lb/>
            Which his looked up to meet in ecstasy. <lb/>
            Their words she heard not; words had ne'er exprest <lb/>
            What well her sickening fancy could supply, <lb/>
            All that their silent eloquence contest, <lb/>
            As breathed the sigh of fire from each impassioned breast.</p>
          <p>While thus she gazed, her quivering lips turn pale; <lb/>
            Contending passions rage within her breast, <lb/>
            Nor ever had she known such bitter bale, <lb/>
            Or felt by such fierce agony opprest. <lb/>
            Oft had her gentle heart been sore distrest, <lb/>
            But meekness ever has a lenient power <lb/>
            From anguish half his keenest darts to wrest; <lb/>
            Meekness for her had softened Sorrow's hour, <lb/>
            Those furious fiends subdued which boisterous souls devour.</p>
          <p>For there are hearts that, like some sheltered lake, <lb/>
            Ne'er swell with rage, nor foam with violence; <lb/>
            Though its sweet placid calm the tempests shake, <lb/>
            Yet will it ne'er with furious impotence <lb/>
            Dash its rude waves against the rocky fence, <lb/>
            Which nature placed the limits of its reign: <lb/>
            Thrice blest! who feel the peace which flows from hence, <lb/>
            Whom meek-eyed Gentleness can thus restrain; <lb/>
            Whatever the storms of fate, with her let none complain!</p>
          <p>That mild associate Psyche now deserts, <lb/>
            Unlovely passions agitate'her soul, <lb/>
            The vile magician all his art exerts, <lb/>
            And triumphs to behold his proud control: <lb/>
            Changed to a serpent's hideous form, he stole <lb/>
            O'er her fair breast to suck her vital blood; <lb/>
            His poisonous involutions round her roll: <lb/>
            Already is his forked tongue imbrued <lb/>
            Warm in the stream of life, her heart's pure purple flood.</p><pb n="492"/>
            
          <p>Thus wretchedly she falls Geloso's prey! <lb/>
            But her, once more, unhoped-for aid shall save! <lb/>
            Admitted shines the clear blue light of day <lb/>
            Upon the horrors of that gloomy grave ; <lb/>
            Her night's soft voice resounds through all the cave, <lb/>
            The affrighted serpent quits his deadly hold, <lb/>
            Nor dares the vengeance of his arm to brave, <lb/>
            Shrunk to a spider's form, while many a fold <lb/>
            Of self-spun web obscene the sorcerer vile enrolled.</p>
          <p>Scarce had the star of his attendant youth <lb/>
            Blazed through the cavern and proclaimed the knight, <lb/>
            When all those spells and visions of untruth, <lb/>
            Bred in dark Erebus and nursed in night, <lb/>
            Dissolving vanished into vapour light; <lb/>
            While Psyche, quite exhausted by her pains, <lb/>
            And hardly trusting her astonished sight, <lb/>
            Now faint and speechless in his arms remains, <lb/>
            Nor memory of the past, nor present sense retains.</p>
          <p>Borne from the cavern, and to life restored, <lb/>
            Her opening eyes behold her knight once more, <lb/>
            She sees whom lost with anguish she deplored ; <lb/>
            Yet a half-feigned resentment still she bore, <lb/>
            Nor sign of joy her face averted wore, <lb/>
            Though joy unuttered panted at her heart; <lb/>
            In sullen silence much she pondered o'er <lb/>
            What from her side induced him to depart, <lb/>
            And all she since had seen by aid of magic art.</p>
          <p>Was it then all a false deluding dream <lb/>
            That wore the semblance of celestial Love ? <lb/>
            On this her wavering thoughts bewildered seem <lb/>
            At length to rest; yet onward as they move, <lb/>
            Though much his tender cares her doubts reprove, <lb/>
            And though she longs to hear, and pardon all, <lb/>
            Silence she still preserves: a while he strove <lb/>
            Her free and cheerful spirits to recall, <lb/>
            But found the task was vainj his words unnoticed fall</p><pb n="493"/>
            
          <p>Now in his turn offended and surprised, <lb/>
            The knight in silence from her side withdrew.; <lb/>
            With pain she marked it, but her pain disguised, <lb/>
            And heedless seemed her journey to pursue, <lb/>
            Nor backward deigned to turn one anxious view <lb/>
            As oft she wished ; till mindful of his lord, <lb/>
            Constance alarmed affectionately flew, <lb/>
            Eager to see their mutual peace restored, <lb/>
            And blamed her cold reserve in many a soft-breathed word.</p>
          <p>" 0 Psyche! would rot thus thy faithful knight, <lb/>
            ' Who fondly sought thee many an anxious hour, <lb/>
            Though bleeding yet from that inglorious fight, <lb/>
            Where thou wert rescued from the savage power <lb/>
            Of that fell beast who would thy charms devour: <lb/>
            Still faint with wounds, he ceased not to pursue <lb/>
            Thy heedless course : let not displeasure lower <lb/>
            Thus on thy brow: think not his heart untrue ! <lb/>
            Think not that e'er from thee he willingly withdrew."</p>
          <p>With self-reproach and sweet returning trust, <lb/>
            While yet he spoke, her generous heart replies, <lb/>
            Soft melting pity bids her now be just, <lb/>
            And own the error which deceived her eyes; <lb/>
            Her little pride she longs to sacrifice, <lb/>
            And ask forgiveness of her suffering knight; <lb/>
            Her suffering knight, alas! no more she spies, <lb/>
            He has withdrawn offended from her sight, <lb/>
            Nor can that gentle voice now hope to stay his flight.</p>
          <p>Struggling no more her sorrows to restrain, <lb/>
            Her streaming eyes look -round with anxious fear; <lb/>
            Nor are those tender showers now shed in vain, <lb/>
            Her soft lamenting voice has reached his ear, <lb/>
            Where latent he had marked each precious tear ; <lb/>
            Sudden as thought behold him at her feet! <lb/>
            Oh ! reconciling moment! charm most dear! <lb/>
            What feeling heart thy pleasures would repeat, <lb/>
            Or wish thy dearly purchased bliss, however sweet ?</p><pb n="494"/>
            
          <p>The smiles of joy which swell her glowing check, <lb/>
            And o'er her parting lips divinely play, <lb/>
            Returning pleasure eloquently speak, <lb/>
            Forgetful of the tears which lingering stay, <lb/>
            (Like sparkling dew-drops in a sunny day,) <lb/>
            Unheeded tenants of rejoicing eyes; <lb/>
            His wounds her tender care can well repay : <lb/>
            There grateful kindness breathes her balmy sighs, <lb/>
            Beneath her lenient hand how swiftly suffering flies !</p>
          <p>Freed from the mazes of Disfida's groves, <lb/>
            The opening landscape brightens to their view; <lb/>
            Psyche, with strength revived, now onward moves <lb/>
            In cheerful hope, with courage to renew <lb/>
            Repeated toils, and perils to pursue: <lb/>
            Thus when some tender plant neglected pines, <lb/>
            Shed o'er its pendent head the kindly dew, <lb/>
            How soon refreshed its vivid lustre shines! <lb/>
            Once more the leaf expands, the drooping tendril twines.</p>
          <p>Thus cheered, the knight intreats her to impart <lb/>
            The dangers which her way had since betel, <lb/>
            Her timid lips refuse to speak the art <lb/>
            Which clothed him in a form she loved so well: <lb/>
            That she had thought him Love, she blushed to tell! <lb/>
            Confused she stopt; a gentle pause ensued; <lb/>
            What chance had brought him to the demon's cell <lb/>
            She then enquires ; what course he had pursued, <lb/>
            And who his steps had led throughout the mazy wood.</p>
          <p>Sooth he had much to say, though modest shame <lb/>
            His gallant deeds forbade him to declare; <lb/>
            For while through those bewildering woods he came, <lb/>
            Assisted by his page's active care, <lb/>
            He had detected Varia's wily snare, <lb/>
            And forced her wanton retinue to flee. <lb/>
            With like disgrace, malignant in despair, <lb/>
            Disfida's slaves their plots defeated see, <lb/>
            Their feeble malice scorned, their destined victims free.</p><pb n="495"/>
            
          <p>But he had marked the traces of their feet, <lb/>
            And found the path which to the cavern led: <lb/>
            Whence now, rejoicing in reunion sweet, <lb/>
            Their way together cheerfully they tread, <lb/>
            Exempt a while from danger and from dread; <lb/>
            While Psyche's heart, with confidence more bold, <lb/>
            Full oft the hour of rapture pictured, <lb/>
            When those celestial charms she should behold, <lb/>
            And feel the arms of Love once more his bride enfold.</p>

            Who that the faithless ocean had not known, <lb/>
            Which now the strand in placid whispers laves, <lb/>

            When angry Boreas bids the storm arise, <lb/>
            And calls his wild winds from their wintry caves ? <lb/>
            Now soft Favonius breathes his gentlest sighs, <lb/>
            Auspicious omens wait, serenely smile the skies.</p>
          <p>The eager mariners now seize the oar, <lb/>
            The streamers flutter in the favouring gale. <lb/>
            Nor unattended did they leave the shore: <lb/>
            Hymen, whose smiles shall o'er mischance prevail, <lb/>
            Sits at the helm, or spreads the swelling sail: <lb/>
            Swift through the parting waves the vessel flies. <lb/>
            And now at distance scarce can Psyche hail <lb/>
            The shore, so fast receding from her eyes, <lb/>
            Or bless the snowy cliffs which o'er the coast arise.</p>
          <p>Pleased with her voyage and the novel scene, <lb/>
            Hope's vivid ray her cheerful heart expands: <lb/>
            Delighted now she eyes the blue serene, <lb/>
            The purple hills, and distant rising lands, <lb/>
            Or, when the sky the silver queen commands, <lb/>
            In pleasing silence listens to the oar <lb/>
            Dashed by the frequent stroke of equal hands; <lb/>
            Or asks her knight if yet the promised shore <lb/>
            May bless her longing eyes when morn shall light restore ?</p>
          <p>The impatient question oft repeated thus <lb/>
            He smiling hears, and still with many a tale, <lb/>
            Or song of heavenly lore unknown to us <lb/>
            Beguiles the live-long night, or flagging sail, <lb/>
            When the fresh breeze begins their bark to fail. <lb/>
            Strong ran the tide against the vessel's course, <lb/>
            And much they need the kind propitious gale <lb/>
            Steady to bear against its rapid force, <lb/>
            And aid the labouring oars, their tedious last resource.</p><pb n="508"/>
            
          <p>But lo! the blackening surface of the deep <lb/>
            With sullen murmurs now begins to swell, <lb/>
            On ruffled wing the screaming sea-fowl sweep <lb/>
            The unlovely surge, and piteous seem to tell <lb/>
            How from the low-hung clouds with fury fell <lb/>
            The demons of the tempest threatening rage; <lb/>
            There, brooding future terrors, yet they dwell, <lb/>
            Till with collected force dread war they wage, <lb/>
            And in convulsive gusts the adverse winds engage.</p>
          <p>The trembling Psyche, supplicating Heaven, <lb/>
            Lifts to the storm her fate-deploring eye, <lb/>
            Sees o'er her head the livid lightnings driven : <lb/>
            Then, turned in horror from the blazing sky, <lb/>
            Clings to her knight in speechless agony: <lb/>
            He all his force exerts the bark to steer, <lb/>
            And bids the mariners each effort try <lb/>
            To escape the rocky coast which threatens near, <lb/>
            For Hymen taught the youth that dangerous shore to fear.</p>
          <p>Who has not listened to his tuneful lay, <lb/>
            That sings so well the hateful cave of Spleen ? <lb/>
            Those lands, submitted to her gloomy sway, <lb/>
            Now open to their view a dreary scene, <lb/>
            As the sad subjects of the sullen queen <lb/>
            Hang o'er the cliffs, and blacken all the strand; <lb/>
            And where the entrance of the cave is seen <lb/>
            A peevish, fretful, melancholy band. <lb/>
            Her ever wrangling slaves, in jarring concert stand.</p>
          <p>Driven by the hurricane they touch the shore, <lb/>
            The frowning guards prepare to seize their prey, <lb/>
            The knight (attentive to the helm no more) <lb/>
            Resumes his arms, and bids his shield display <lb/>
            Its brilliant orb : " Psyche let no dismay <lb/>
            Possess thy gentle breast," he chcerly cries, <lb/>
            " Behind thy knight in fearless safety stay <lb/>
            Smile at the dart which o'er thee vainly flies, <lb/>
            Secure from each attack their powerless rage despises</p><pb n="509"/>
            
          <p>" Soon shall the fury of the winds be past, <lb/>
            Serener skies shall brighten to our view, <lb/>
            Let us not yield to the imperious blast <lb/>
            Which now forbids our vessel to pursue <lb/>
            Its purposed course; soon shall the heavens renew <lb/>
            Their calm clear smile; and soon our coward foes, <lb/>
            Despairing thus our courage to subdue, <lb/>
            Shall cease their idle weapons to oppose, <lb/>
            And unmolested Peace restore our lost repose."</p>
          <p>Still as he spoke, where'er he turned his shield <lb/>
            The darts drop quivering from each slackened bow, <lb/>
            Unnerved each arm, no force remains to wield <lb/>
            The weighty falchion, or the javelin throw; <lb/>
            Each voice half choked expires in murmurs low, <lb/>
            A dizzy mist obscures their wondering sight, <lb/>
            Their eyes no more their wonted fury know, <lb/>
            With stupid awe they gaze upon the knight, <lb/>
            Or, as his voice they hear, trembling disperse in flight.</p>
          <p>Yet raged the storm with unabated power; <lb/>
            A little creek the labouring vessel gains ; <lb/>
            There they resolve to endure the blustering hour, <lb/>
            The dashing billows, and the beating rains <lb/>
            Soon as the bark the sheltering bay attains, <lb/>
            And in the shallows moored securely rides, <lb/>
            Attentive still to soften all her pains, <lb/>
            The watchful knight for Psyche's ease provides; <lb/>
            Some fisher's hut perchance the shelving harbour hides.</p>
          <p>Deep in the sterile bank a grotto stood, <lb/>
            Whose winding caves repel the inclement air, <lb/>
            Worn in the hollowed rock by many a flood <lb/>
            And sounding surge that dashed its white foam there, <lb/>
            The refuge now of a defenceless fair, <lb/>
            Who issuing thence, with courteous kind intent <lb/>
            Approached the knight, and kindly bade him share <lb/>
            Whatever good indulgent heaven had lent <lb/>
            To cheer her hapless years in lonely suffering spent.</p><pb n="510"/>
            
          <p>More sweet than Health's fresh bloom the wan hue seemed <lb/>
            Which sat upon her pallid cheek ; her eye, <lb/>
            Her placid eye, with dove-like softness beamed; <lb/>
            Her head unshielded from the pitiless sky, <lb/>
            Loose to the rude wild blast her tresses fly, <lb/>
            Bare were her feet which pressed the shelly shore <lb/>
            With firm unshrinking step ; while smilingly <lb/>
            She eyes the dashing billows as they roar, <lb/>
            And braves the boisterous storms so oft endured before.</p>
          <p>Long had she there in silent sorrow dwelt, <lb/>
            And many a year resigned to grief had known; <lb/>
            Spleen's cruel insolence she oft had felt, <lb/>
            But never would the haughty tyrant own, <lb/>
            Nor heed the darts which, from a distance thrown, <lb/>
            Screened by her cavern she could safely shun ; <lb/>
            The thorny brakes she trod for food alone, <lb/>
            Drank the cold stream which near the grotto run, <lb/>
            And bore the winter's frosts and scorching summer's sun.</p>
          <p>In early youth, exchanging mutual vows, <lb/>
            Courage had wooed and won his lovely bride; <lb/>
            Tossed on those stormy seas, her daring spouse <lb/>
            From her fond arms the cruel waves divide, <lb/>
            And dashed her fainting on that rock's rough side. <lb/>
            Still hope she keeps, and still her constant heart <lb/>
            Expects to hail with each returning tide <lb/>
            His dear remembered bark; hence can no art <lb/>
            From those unlovely scenes induce her to depart.</p>
          <p>When the vexed seas their stormy mountains roll, <lb/>
            She loves the shipwrecked mariner to cheer; <lb/>
            The trembling wretch escaped from Spleen's control, <lb/>
            Deep in her silent cell conceals his fear, <lb/>
            And panting finds repose and refuge here; <lb/>
            Benevolently skilled each wound to heal, <lb/>
            To her the sufferer flies, with willing ear <lb/>
            She wooes them all their anguish to reveal, <lb/>
            And while she speaks, they half forget the woes they feel.</p><pb n="511"/>

            Largely she heaped with hospitable thought <lb/>

            O'er her chilled form her own soft mantle cast, <lb/>

            Like the kind red-breast tenderly shall sing, <lb/>
            Which swells 'mid dreary snows its tuneful throat, <lb/>
            Brushing the cold dews from its shivering wing, <lb/>
            With cheerful promise of returning spring <lb/>
            To the mute tenants of the leafless grove. <lb/>
            Guard thy best treasure from the venomed sting <lb/>
            Of baneful peevishness; oh! never prove <lb/>
            How soon ill-temper's power can banish gentle Love !</p>
          <p>Repentance may the storms of passion chase, <lb/>
            And Love, who shrunk affrighted from the blast, <lb/>
            May hush his just complaints in soft embrace, <lb/>
            And smiling wipe his tearful eye at last: <lb/>
            Yet when the wind's rude violence is past, <lb/>
            Look what a wreck the scattered fields display ! <lb/>
            See on the ground the withering blossoms cast! <lb/>
            And hear sad Philomel with piteous lay <lb/>
            Deplore the tempest's rage that swept her young away.</p><pb n="513"/>
            
          <p>The tears capricious Beauty loves to shed, <lb/>
            The pouting lip, the sullen silent tongue, <lb/>
            May wake the impassioned lover's tender dread, <lb/>
            And touch the spring that clasps his soul so strong; <lb/>
            But ah, beware! the gentle power too long <lb/>
            Will not endure the frown of angry strife ; <lb/>
            He shuns contention, and the gloomy throng <lb/>
            Who blast the joys of calm domestic life, <lb/>
            And flies when Discord shakes her brand with quarrels rife.</p>
          <p>Oh ! he will tell you that these quarrels bring <lb/>
            The ruin, not renewal of his flame : <lb/>
            If oft repeated, lo ! on rapid wing <lb/>
            He flies to hide his fair but tender frame; <lb/>
            From violence, reproach, or peevish blame <lb/>
            Irrevocably flies. Lament in vain! <lb/>
            Indifference comes the abandoned heart to claim, <lb/>
            Asserts for ever her repulsive reign, <lb/>
            Close followed by Disgust and all her chilling train.</p>
          <p>Indifference, dreaded power! what art shall save <lb/>
            The good so cherished from thy grasping hand ? <lb/>
            How shall young Love escape the untimely grave <lb/>
            Thy treacherous arts prepare ? or how withstand <lb/>
            The insidious foe, who with her leaden band <lb/>
            Enchains the thoughtless, slumbering deity ? <lb/>
            Ah, never more to wake! or e'er expand <lb/>
            His golden pinions to the breezy sky, <lb/>
            Or open to the sun his dim and languid eye.</p>
          <p>Who can describe the hopeless, silent pang <lb/>
            With which the gentle heart first marks her sway ? <lb/>
            Eyes the sure progress of her icy fang <lb/>
            Resistless, slowly fastening on her prey; <lb/>
            Sees rapture's brilliant colours fade away. <lb/>
            And all the glow of beaming sympathy; <lb/>
            Anxious to watch the cold averted ray <lb/>
            That speaks no more to the fond meeting eye <lb/>
            Enchanting tales of love, and tenderness, and joy. <note type="footnote"> LL </note> <pb n="514"/>

          <p>Too faithful heart! thou never canst retrieve <lb/>
            Thy withered hopes: conceal the cruel pain! <lb/>
            O'er thy lost treasure still in silence grieve ; <lb/>
            But never to the unfeeling ear complain: <lb/>
            From fruitless struggles dearly bought refrain! <lb/>
            Submit at once-the bitter task resign, <lb/>
            Nor watch and fan the expiring flame in vain; <lb/>
            Patience, consoling maid, may yet be thine, <lb/>
            Go seek her quiet cell, and hear her voice divine!</p>
          <p>But lo! the joyous sun, the soft-breathed gales <lb/>
            By zephyrs sent to kiss the placid seas, <lb/>
            Curl the green wave, and fill the swelling sails; <lb/>
            The seamen's shouts, which jocund hail the breeze, <lb/>
            Call the glad knight the favouring hour to seize. <lb/>
            Her gentle hostess Psyche oft embraced, <lb/>
            Who still solicitous her guest to please, <lb/>
            On her fair breast a talisman had placed, <lb/>
            And with the valued gem her parting blessing graced.</p>
          <p>How gaily now the bark pursues its way, <lb/>
            Urged by the steady gale! while round the keel <lb/>
            The bubbling currents in sweet whispers play, <lb/>
            Their force repulsive now no more they feel; <lb/>
            No clouds the unsullied face of heaven conceal, <lb/>
            But the clear azure one pure dome displays, <lb/>
            Whether it bids the star of day reveal <lb/>
            His potent beams, or Cynthia's milder rays <lb/>
            On deep cerulean skies invite the eye to gaze.</p>
          <p>Almost unconscious they their course pursue, <lb/>
            So smooth the vessel cuts the watery plain; <lb/>
            The wide horizon to their boundless view <lb/>
            Gives but the sky, and Neptune's ample reign: <lb/>
            Still the unruffled bosom of the main <lb/>
            Smiles undiversitied by varying wind; <lb/>
            No toil the idle mariners sustain, <lb/>
            While, listless, slumbering o'er his charge reclined, <lb/>
            The pilot cares no more the unerring helm to mind.</p><pb n="515"/>
            
          <p>With light exulting heart glad Psyche sees <lb/>
            Their rapid progress as they quit the shore: <lb/>
            Yet weary languor steals by slow degrees <lb/>
            Upon her tranquil mind; she joys no more <lb/>
            The never-changing scene to wander o'er <lb/>
            With still admiring eye; the enchanting song <lb/>
            Yields not that lively charm it knew before, <lb/>
            When first enraptured by his tuneful tongue <lb/>
            She bade her vocal knight the heavenly strain prolong.</p>
          <p>A damp chill mist now deadens all the air, <lb/>
            A drowsy dullness seems o'er all to creep, <lb/>
            No more the heavens their smile of brightness wear, <lb/>
            The winds are hushed, while the dim glassy deep <lb/>
            Oppressed by sluggish vapours seems to sleep; <lb/>
            See his light scarf the knight o'er Psyche throws, <lb/>
            Solicitous his lovely charge to keep <lb/>
            From still increasing cold; while deep repose <lb/>
            Benumbs each torpid sense, and bids her eye-lids close.</p>
          <p>Now as with languid stroke they ply the oars, <lb/>
            While the dense fog obscures their gloomy way; <lb/>
            Hymen, well used to coast these dangerous shores, <lb/>
            Roused from the dreaming trance in which he lay, <lb/>
            Cries to the knight in voice of dread dismay, <lb/>
            " Steer hence thy bark, oh! yet in time beware ; <lb/>
            Here lies Petrea, which with baneful sway <lb/>
            Glacella rules, I feel the dank cold air, <lb/>
            I hear her chilling voice, methinks it speaks despair!"</p>
          <p>Even while he speaks, behold the vessel stands <lb/>
            Immoveable ! in vain the pilot tries <lb/>
            The helm to turn ; fixed in the shallow strands, <lb/>
            No more obedient to his hand, it lies, <lb/>
            The disappointed oar no aid supplies <lb/>
            While sweeping o'er the sand it mocks their force. <lb/>
            The anxious knight to Constance now applies, <lb/>
            To his oft-tried assistance has recourse, <lb/>
            And bids his active mind design some swift resource. <note type="footnote"> L L 2 </note> <pb n="516"/>
            </p>
          <p>Debating doubtfully awhile they stood, <lb/>
            At length on their united strength rely, <lb/>
            To force the bark on the supporting flood; <lb/>
            They rouse the seamen, who half slumbering lie, <lb/>
            Subdued and loaded by the oppressive sky. <lb/>
            Then wading 'mid the fog, with care explore <lb/>
            What side the deepest waters may supply, <lb/>
            And where the shallows least protect the shore, <lb/>
            While through their darksome search the star sheds light before</p>
          <p>Mean time deep slumbers of the vaporous mist <lb/>
            Hang on the heavy eye-lids of the fair; <lb/>
            And Hymen too, unable to resist <lb/>
            The drowsy force of the o'erwhelming air, <lb/>
            Laid at her feet at length forgets his care. <lb/>
            When lo! Glacella's treacherous slaves advance, <lb/>
            Deep wrapt in thickest gloom; the sleeping fair <lb/>
            They seize, and bear away in heedless trance, <lb/>
            Long ere her guardian knight suspects the bitter chance.</p>
          <p>Thus the lorn traveller imprudent sleeps <lb/>
            Where his high glaciers proud Locendro shews; <lb/>
            Thus o'er his limbs resistless torpor creeps, <lb/>
            As yielding to the fatal deep repose <lb/>
            He sinks benumbed upon the Alpine snows, <lb/>
            And sleeps no more to wake; no more to view <lb/>
            The blooming scenes his native vales disclose. <lb/>
            Or ever more the craggy patn pursue, <lb/>
            Or o'er the lichened steep the chamois chase renew.</p>
          <p>Lo! to their queen they bear their sleeping prey. <lb/>
            Deep in her ice-built castle's gloomy state, <lb/>
            There on a pompous couch they gently lay <lb/>
            Psyche, as yet unconscious of her fate, <lb/>
            And when her heavy eyes half opening late <lb/>
            Dimly observe the strange and unknown scenes, <lb/>
            As in a dream she views her changed estate, <lb/>
            Gazing around with doubtful, troubled mien <lb/>
            Now on the stupid crowd, now on their dull proud queen.</p><pb n="517"/>
            
          <p>With vacant smile, and words but half exprest, <lb/>
            In one ungracious, never-varying tone, <lb/>
            Glacella welcomes her bewildered guest, <lb/>
            And bids the chief supporter of her throne <lb/>
            Approach and make their mighty mistress known, <lb/>
            Proud Selfishness, her dark ill-favoured lord! <lb/>
            Her gorgeous seat, which still he shared alone, <lb/>
            He slowly leaves obedient to her word, <lb/>
            And ever as he moved the cringing train adored.</p>
          <p>Nought of his shapeless form to sight appears, <lb/>
            Impenetrable furs conceal each part; <lb/>
            Harsh and unpleasing sounds in Psyche's ears <lb/>
            That voice which had subdued full many a heart; <lb/>
            While he, exerting every specious art, <lb/>
            Persuades her to adore their queen's control; <lb/>
            Yet would he not Glacella's name impart, <lb/>
            But with false title, which she artful stole <lb/>
            From fair Philosophy, deludes the erring soul.</p>
          <p>" Rest, happy fair!" he cries, " who here hast found <lb/>
            From all the storms of life a safe retreat, <lb/>

            And various scenes of revelry display; <lb/>
            Here Grandeur sunk beneath the massive gold; <lb/>
            Here discontented Beauty pined away, <lb/>
            And vainly conscious asked her promised sway; <lb/>
            Here Luxury prepared his sumptuous feast, <lb/>
            While lurking Apathy behind him lay <lb/>
            To poison all the insipid food he drest, <lb/>
            And shake his poppy crown o'er every sated guest.</p>
          <p>The hireling minstrels strke their weary lyre, <lb/>
            And slumber o'er the oft-repeated strain; <lb/>
            No listless youth to active grace they fire : <lb/>
            Here Eloquence herself might plead in vain, <lb/>
            Nor one of all the heartless crowd could gain: <lb/>

            Affection's voice divine ! with cold disdain <lb/>

            Repulsed with gentle murmurs thus it goes, <lb/>
            Till in the porous earth it finds repose, <lb/>
            Concealed .and sheltered in its parent's breast <lb/>
            Oh ! man's best treasure in this vale of woes! <lb/>

            Her scentless roses, painted mimicry, <lb/>

            Her noxious hands its might should guide no more, <lb/>
            And bade the seas conceal its Hydra face: <lb/>
            Oh! kindly meant, though much defeated grace ! <lb/>
            For though the o'erwhelming weight of sounding waves <lb/>
            Conceal its rugged orb a little space, <lb/>
            Snatched by Glacella from the dark deep caves, <lb/>
            Once more the arm of Love with potent spell it braves.</p>
          <p>But Psyche, rescued from their cruel scorn, <lb/>
            Urges her knight to hasten from the shore : <lb/>
            The buoyant vessel on the billows borne <lb/>
            Rides proudly o'er the mountain surge once more; <lb/>
            Again they spread the sails, the feathered oar <lb/>
            Skims with impatient stroke the sparkling tide; <lb/>
            The blushing Hymen now their smiles restore <lb/>
            Again to frolic gaily at their side, <lb/>
            Though still their playful taunts reproach their slumbering guide.</p>
          <p>Psyche looks back with horror on the coast; <lb/>
            Black, drear, and desolate is all the scene: <lb/>
            The rocky cliffs still human shape may boast; <lb/>
            There the sad victims of the cruel Queen, <lb/>
            Memorials of her baneful power, are seen: <lb/>
            No vine-crowned hills, no glowing vales appear, <lb/>
            Nor the white cottage laughs upon the green; <lb/>
            The black and leafless thorn alone is there, <lb/>
            And the chill mountains lift their summits wild and bare.</p>
          <p>Her spirits lighten as they leave behind <lb/>
            The dreary prospect of Glacella's isle ; N <lb/>
            She blest with gladdened heart the light-winged wind <lb/>
            That bears her swiftly from a scene so vile ; <lb/>
            With glistening eye, and hope's prophetic smile, <lb/>
            She hears her knight foretel their dangers o'er, <lb/>
            That sure success shall crown their fated toil, <lb/>
            And soon arriving at that happy shore, <lb/>
            Love shall again be found, and leave his bride no more.</p><pb n="522"/>
            
          <p>Now, from light slumbers and delicious dreams, <lb/>
            The jocund cry of joy aroused the fair ; <lb/>
            The morn that kissed her eyes with golden beams, <lb/>
            Bade her the universal transport share; <lb/>
            Divinely breathed the aromatic air, <lb/>
            And Psyche's heart, half fainting with delight, <lb/>
            In the peculiar odour wafted there <lb/>
            Recalled the breezes which, o'er scenes most bright, <lb/>
            Their wings of perfume shook, and lingering stayed their flight.</p>
          <p>The lovely shore the mariners descry, <lb/>
            And many a gladsome cheer the prospect hails; <lb/>
            Its graceful hills rise full before the eye, <lb/>
            While eagerly expanding all their sails <lb/>
            They woo the freshness of the morning gales, <lb/>
            The approaching scenes new-opening charms display, <lb/>
            And Psyche's palpitating courage fails, <lb/>
            She sees arrived at length the important day, <lb/>
            Uncertain yet of power the mandate to obey.</p>
          <p>But one dear object every wish confines, . <lb/>
            Her spouse is promised in that bower of rest: <lb/>
            And shall the sun, that now so cheerful shines, <lb/>
            Indeed behold her to his bosom prest, <lb/>
            And in his heavenly smiles of fondness blest ? <lb/>
            Oh ! 'tis too much!—exhausted life she fears <lb/>
            Will struggling leave her agitated breast, <lb/>
            Ere to her longing eyes his form appears, <lb/>
            Or the soft hand of Love shall wipe away her tears.</p>
          <p>Oh! how impatience gains upon the soul <lb/>
            When the long-promised hour of joy draws near! <lb/>
            How slow the tardy moments seem to roll! <lb/>
            What spectres rise of inconsistent fear! <lb/>
            To the fond doubting heart its hopes appear <lb/>
            Too brightly fair, too sweet to realize ; <lb/>
            All seem but day-dreams of delight too dear! <lb/>
            Strange hopes and fears in painful contest rise, <lb/>
            While the scarce-trusted bliss seems but to cheat the eyes.</p><pb n="523"/>
            
          <p>But safely anchored in the happy port, <lb/>
            Led by her knight the golden sands she prest: <lb/>
            His heart beat high, his panting breath heaved short, <lb/>
            And sighs proclaim his agitated breast, <lb/>
            By some important secret thought opprest: <lb/>
            ., At length," he cries, "behold the fated spring! <lb/>
            Yon rugged cliff conceals the fountain blest, <lb/>
            (Dark rocks its crystal source o'ershadowing,) <lb/>
            And Constance swift for thee the destined urn shall bring.</p>
          <p>He speaks, but scarce she hears, her soul intent <lb/>
            Surveys as in a dream each well-known scene : <lb/>
            Now from the pointed hills her eye she bent <lb/>
            Inquisitive o'er all the sloping green; <lb/>
            The graceful temple meet for Beauty's queen, <lb/>
            The orange groves that ever blooming glow; <lb/>
            The silvery flood, the ambrosial air serene, <lb/>
            The matchless trees that fragrant shade bestow, <lb/>
            All speak to Psyche's soul, all seem their queen to know.</p>
          <p>Let the vain rover, who his youth has past <lb/>
            Misled in idle search of happiness, <lb/>
            Declare, by late experience taught at last, <lb/>
            In all his toils he gained but weariness, <lb/>
            Wooed the coy goddess but to find that less <lb/>
            She ever grants where dearest she is bought; <lb/>
            She loves the sheltering bowers of home to bless, <lb/>
            Marks with her peaceful hand the favourite spot, <lb/>
            And smiles to see that Love has home his Psyche brought.</p>
          <p>On the. dear earth she kneels the turf to press, <lb/>
            With grateful lips and fondly streaming eyes, <lb/>
            "Are these the unknown bowers of Happiness? <lb/>
            Oh! justly called, and gained at last!" she cries, <lb/>
            As eagerly to seize the urn she flies. <lb/>
            But lo ! while yet she gazed with wondering eye, <lb/>
            Constance ascends the steep to gain the prize; <lb/>
            The eagle's eyry is not built so high <lb/>
            As soon she sees his star bright blazing to the sky.</p><pb n="524"/>
            
          <p>With light and nimble foot the boy descends, <lb/>
            And lifts the urn triumphant in his hand; <lb/>
            Low at the turf-raised altar Psyche bends, <lb/>
            While her fond eyes her promised Love demand; <lb/>
            Close at her side her faithful guardians stand, <lb/>
            As thus with timid voice she pays her vows, <lb/>
            "Venus, fulfilled is thine adored command, <lb/>
            Thy voice divine the suppliant's claim allows, <lb/>
            The smile of favour grant, restore her heavenly spouse."</p>
          <p>Scarce on the altar had she placed the urn, <lb/>
            When lo ! in whispers to the ravished ear <lb/>
            Speaks the soft voice of Love! " Turn, Psyche, turn! <lb/>
            And see at last, released from every fear, <lb/>
            Thy spouse, thy faithful knight, thy lover here !" <lb/>
            From his celestial brow the helmet fell, <lb/>
            In joy's full glow, unveiled his charms appear, <lb/>
            Beaming delight and love unspeakable, <lb/>
            While in one rapturous glance their mingling souls they tell</p>
          <p>Two tapers thus, with pure converging rays. <lb/>
            In momentary flash their beams unite, <lb/>
            Shedding but one inseparable blaze <lb/>
            Of blended radiance and effulgence bright, <lb/>
            Self-lost in mutual intermingling light; <lb/>
            Thus, in her lover's circling arms embraced, <lb/>
            The fainting Psyche's soul, by sudden flight, <lb/>
            With his its subtlest essence interlaced; <lb/>
            Oh! bliss too vast for thought! by words how poorly traced!</p>
          <p>Fond youth! whom Fate hath summoned to depart, <lb/>
            And quit the object of thy tenderest love,, <lb/>
            How oft in absence shall thy pensive heart <lb/>
            Count the sad hours which must in exile move, <lb/>
            And still their irksome weariness reprove; <lb/>
            Distance with cruel weight but loads thy chain <lb/>
            With every step which bids thee farther rove, <lb/>
            While thy reverted eye, with fruitless pain, <lb/>
            Shall seek the trodden path its treasure to regain.</p><pb n="525"/>
            
          <p>For thee what rapturous moments are prepared! <lb/>
            For thee shall dawn the long-expected day! <lb/>
            And he who ne'er thy tender woes hath shared, <lb/>
            Hath never known the transport they shall pay, <lb/>
            To wash the memory of those woes away : <lb/>
            The bitter tears of absence thou must shed, <lb/>
            To know the bliss which tears of joy convey, <lb/>
            When the long hours of sad regret are fled, <lb/>
            And in one dear embrace thy pains compensated !</p>
          <p>Even from afar beheld, how eagerly <lb/>
            With rapture thou shalt hail the loved abode ! <lb/>
            Perhaps already, with impatient eye, <lb/>
            From the dear casement she hath marked thy road, <lb/>
            And many a sigh for thy return bestowed! <lb/>
            Even there she meets thy fond enamoured glance: <lb/>
            Thy soul with grateful tenderness o'erflowed, <lb/>
            Which firmly bore the hand of hard mischance, <lb/>
            Faints in the stronger power of joy's o'erwhelming trance.</p>
          <p>With Psyche thou alone canst sympathise, <lb/>
            Thy heart benevolently shares her joy! <lb/>
            See her unclose her rapture-beaming eyes, <lb/>
            And catch that softly pleasureable sigh, <lb/>
            That tells unutterable ecstasy! <lb/>
            While hark melodious numbers through the air, <lb/>
            On clouds of fragrance wafted from the sky, <lb/>
            Their ravished souls to pious awe prepare, <lb/>
            And lo! the herald doves the Queen of Love declare.</p>
          <p>With fond embrace she clasped her long-lost son, <lb/>
            And gracefully received his lovely bride, <lb/>
            " Psyche ! thou hardly hast my favour won !" <lb/>
            With roseate smile her heavenly parent cried, <lb/>
            " Yet hence thy charms immortal, deified, <lb/>
            With the young Joys, thy future offspring fair, <lb/>
            Shall bloom for ever at thy lover's side ; <lb/>
            All-ruling Jove's high mandate I declare, <lb/>
            Blest denizen of Heaven ! arise, its joys to share."</p><pb n="526"/>
            
          <p>She ceased, and lo! a thousand voices, joined <lb/>
            In sweetest chorus, Love's high triumph sing; <lb/>
            There, with the Graces and the Hours entwined, <lb/>
            His fairy train their rosy garlands bring, <lb/>
            Or round their mistress sport on halcyon wing; <lb/>
            While she enraptured lives in his dear eye, <lb/>
            And drinks immortal love from that pure spring <lb/>
            Of never-failing full felicity, <lb/>
            Bathed in ambrosial showers of bliss eternally!</p>
          <p>Dreams of delight, farewell! your charms no more <lb/>
            Shall gild the hours of solitary gloom! <lb/>
            The page remains-but can the page restore <lb/>
            The vanished bowers which Fancy taught to bloom ? <lb/>
            Ah, no : her smiles no longer can illume <lb/>
            The path my Psyche treads no more for me; <lb/>
            Consigned to dark oblivion's silent tomb, <lb/>
            The visionary scenes no more I see, <lb/>
            Fast from the fading lines the vivid colours flee!</p>
