            Dionysia of the Archon Callias, a. c. 411. Musgrave has neglected <lb/>
            these testimonies, and has followed Petitus in the chronology of <lb/>
            this Play, which he places in 01. 92, 4, or three years below the true <lb/>
            time." Clinton, Fasti Hellenici, p. 73. Droysen, (Introduction to the <lb/>
            Lysistrata, p. 127,) " It has not been recorded whether this play was <lb/>
            brought on the stage at the Lenæan festival, or at the Dionysia, <lb/>
            i. e. in January or March of the year 411. According to the internal <lb/>
            evidence of the time, the latter would appear the more probable." <lb/>
            The plot is this:—Lysistrata, the wife of an Athenian magistrate, <lb/>
            takes it into her head to attempt a pacification between the belli­ <lb/>
            gcrents. She summons a council of women, who come to a deter­ <lb/>
            mination to expel their husbands from their beds, until they con­ <lb/>
            clude a peace. In the mean time the elder women are commissioned <lb/>
            to seize the Acropolis, and make themselves masters of the money <lb/>
            which had been stowed therein for the purposes of war. Their <lb/>
            design succeeds ; and the husbands are reduced to a terrible <lb/>
            plight by the novel resolution of their wives. Ambassadors at <lb/>
            length come from the belligerent parties, and peace is concluded <lb/>
            with the greatest despatch, under the direction of the clever Lysis­ <lb/>
            trata.</p><pb n="-"/>

          <p>LYS. WELL! if one had summoned them to the temple of <lb/>
            Bacchus,1 or Pan, or Colias,2 or Genetyllis, it would not even <lb/>
            have been possible to pass through by reason of the kettle­ <lb/>
            drums : but now not a single woman is present here ; saving <lb/>
            that my neighbour here is coming forth. [Enter Calonice.] <lb/>
            Welcome, Calonice!</p>
          <p>CALON. And you too, Lysistrata ! Why are you troubled ? <lb/>
            Be not of a sad countenance, child! for it does not beseem you <lb/>
            to arch3 your eyebrows.</p>
          <p>LYS. I am inflamed in my heart, Calonice, and am greatly <lb/>
            vexed on account of us women, because we are considered <lb/>
            among men to be bad</p>
          <p>CALON. For,4 by Jove, we are so !</p>
          <p>LYS. andwhen it was told5 them to meet together here, <note type="footnote"> 1 “ Bacchus was considered libidinous. Eur. Ph. 21, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὸ δ</foreign>’ <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἡδονη̃ δοὺς, <lb/>

            pensable." Droysen. "The difference in usage between <foreign xml:lang="grc">εἰς</foreign> and if: <lb/>
            in the comic writers is this; <foreign xml:lang="grc">εἰς</foreign> is used before vowels, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐς</foreign> before con­ <lb/>
            sonants. The tragic writers so far recede from this rule, as to write <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐς</foreign> before a vowel, when the metre requires it. Cf. Person, Præf. <lb/>
            Hec. p. Ivi. On the other side, see Fritzsche ad Thesm. vs. 657. <lb/>
            Elmsley's opinion, (ad Acharn. vs. 42,) who would expel <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐς</foreign> from the <lb/>

            to deliberate about no small matter, they sleep, and have not <lb/>
            come.</p>
          <p>CALON. But, my dearest, they will come. Of a truth wo­ <lb/>
            men find it difficult to get out. For one of us goes poking 1 <lb/>
            about her husband, another wakens the servant, another puts <lb/>
            the child to bed, another washes Iters, another feeds hers with <lb/>
            morsels.</p>
          <p>LYS. But indeed there were other matters more important <lb/>
            for them than these.</p>
          <p>CALON. What is the matter, dear Lysistrata, for which <lb/>
            you summon us women? What is the affair? Of what <lb/>
            size is it ?</p>
          <p>LYS. Great.</p>
          <p>CALON. Is it also thick ?2</p>
          <p>LYS. And thick, by Jove.</p>
          <p>CALON. Why, how then have we not come?3</p>
          <p>LYS. This is not the fashion of it; for, if it had been so, <lb/>
            we should have quickly assembled. But there is a certain <lb/>
            affair which has been investigated by me, and revolved with <lb/>
            much sleeplessness.</p>
          <p>CALON. Doubtless the matter revolved is somewhat subtle.</p>
          <p>LYS. Aye, so subtle, that the safety of all Greece depends <lb/>
            upon4 the women.</p>
          <p>CALON. Upon the women ? Why, it depended5 on a slight <lb/>
            thing then.</p>
          <p>LYS. Sinceb the affairs of the state depend upon us, either <lb/>
            that there should be no longer any7 Peloponnesians—— <note type="footnote"> would do well to reflect whether the list of accusatives absolute be <lb/>
            not already fuller than can be maintained by fair argument. Cf. <lb/>

            Do you conjecture something4 else! If the women assemble <lb/>
            here, both those from Bceotia, and those from the Pcloponnese, <lb/>
            and we from Attica, we shall save Greece in common.</p>
          <p>CALON. What prudent or brilliant action could women <lb/>
            accomplish ? we, who sit decked5 out, wearing saffron-coloured <lb/>
            robes, and beautified, and wearing loose Cimmerian vests, and <lb/>
            sandals ?</p>
          <p>LYS. For6 in truth these are even the very things, which I <lb/>
            expect will save us; the little saffron-coloured robes, and the <lb/>
            unguents, and the sandals, and the alkanet root, and the trans­ <lb/>
            parent vests.</p>
          <p>CAMON. In what manner, pray ?</p>
          <p>LYS. So that none of the men of the present day lift a spear <lb/>
            against each other</p>
          <p>CALON. Then, by the two goddesses, I'll get me a saffron <lb/>

            For already these matters appear to me to savour of more and <lb/>
            greater deeds; and especially I scent the tyranny of Hip­ <lb/>
            pias;3 and I fear greatly lest some men of the Spartans, <lb/>
            having assembled here in the house of Clisthenes,4 should by <lb/>
            craft stir up the women hateful to the gods to seize upon our <lb/>
            money, and our pay, whereby I lived. For surely it is shame­ <lb/>
            ful that these, women as they are, should now advise the <lb/>
            citizens, and prate about a brazen shield, and besides5 recon­ <lb/>
            cile us to the Lacedæmonians, to whom there's no trusting,6 <lb/>
            unless one can a gaping wolf. But these things, sirs, they <lb/>
            have contrived for a tyranny. But over me they shall not <lb/>
            tyrannize ; for I will be on my guard, and will henceforth wear <lb/>

            behoveth us to grow young again, and to make our whole body <lb/>
            active,4 and to shake off this old age. For if any of us shall <lb/>
            afford these if it were but a small handler they will in no wise <lb/>

            was once a youth, Melanion, who, avoiding marriage, went to <lb/>
            a desert place and dwelt in the mountains. And then he <lb/>
            hunted hares,4 having made nets: and he had a dog. And <lb/>
            be returned home again no more by reason of his hatred. So <lb/>
            much5 did he abominate the women: and we, who are chaste, <lb/>
            abominate them no less than Melanion.6</p>
          <p>OLD MAN. I wish, old woman, to kiss you</p>
          <p>WOMAN. Then you shall not eat an onion.7</p>

          <p>CHO. OF WOM. I also wish to tell you a story in reply to <lb/>

            hatred, went off having imprecated many curses against wicked <lb/>
            men. So much did he always hate in return your3 wicked <lb/>
            men; but he was very dear to the women.</p>

            willed, nor as our husbands6 used unskilfully to do it, but <lb/>
            very affectionately,7 as is proper women should. If any <lb/>
            do not give his hand, lead him by the nose. [Enter Peace <lb/>

              01. 91, 4. Now Aristophanes himself (Thesm. vs. 1060) testifies <lb/>
              that the Andromeda was acted the year before the Thesmophoriazusœ." <lb/>
              Enger. Dindorf and Wachsmuth also refer it to this year; on the <lb/>
              contrary, Dobree and Fritzsche refer it to 01. 92, 2.</p>
          <p>The Thesmophoriazusœ has a proper intrigue, a knot which is not <lb/>
            loosed till the conclusion, and in this therefore possesses a great <lb/>
            advantage. Euripides, on account of the well-known hatred of <lb/>
            women displayed in his tragedies, is accused and condemned at the <lb/>
            Thesmophoria, at which festival women only were admitted. After <lb/>
            a fruitless attempt to induce the effeminate poet Agathon to under­ <lb/>
            take the hazardous experiment, Euripides prevails on his father-in- <lb/>
            law, Mnesilochus, who was somewhat advanced in years, to disguise <lb/>
            himself as a woman, that under this assumed appearance he may <lb/>
            plead his cause. The manner in which he does this gives rise to <lb/>
            suspicions, and he is discovered to be a man; he flies to the altar <lb/>
            for refuge, and to secure himself still more from the impending <lb/>
            danger, he snatches a child from the arms of one of the women, <lb/>
            and threatens to kill it if they do not let him alone. Upon examin­ <lb/>
            ation, however, it turns out to be a wine-skin, wrapped up like a <lb/>
            child. Euripides now appears in a number of different shapes to <lb/>
            save his friend: at one time he is Menelaus, who finds Helen again <lb/>
            in Egypt; at another time he is Echo, helping the chained Andro­ <lb/>
            meda to pour out her lamentations, and immediately after he a - <lb/>
            pears as Perseus, about to release her from the rock. At length he <lb/>
            succeeds in rescuing Mnesilochus, who is fastened to a sort of pil­ <lb/>
            lory, by assuming the character of a procuress, and enticing away <lb/>
            the officer of justice who has charge of him, a simple barbarian, by <lb/>
            the charms of a dancing-girl. These parodied scenes, composed <lb/>
            almost entirely in the very words of Euripides' tragedies, are in­ <lb/>
            imitable. Whenever Euripides is introduced, we may always, ge­ <lb/>
            nerally speaking, lay our account with having the most ingenious <lb/>
            and apposite ridicule: it seems as if the mind of Aristophanes pos­ <lb/>
            sessed a peculiar and specific power of giving a comic turn to the <lb/>
            poetry of this tragedian. Whatever be the faults of the present <lb/>
            play, it will be very generally admitted to be the drollest and most <lb/>
            facetious of all the writings of Aristophanes.</p><pb n="451"/>

            of your envy, but the pain I did not feel! I wear my attire <lb/>
            in accordance with3 my thoughts. For it behoveth a poet, <lb/>
            conformably to the dramas which he must compose, to have <lb/>
            his turn of mind in accordance with these. For example,4 if <lb/>
            one be composing female dramas, the body of the poet ought <lb/>
            to have a participation in their manners.</p>
          <p>MNES. Therefore do you mount on horseback when you <lb/>

            and Anacreon of Teos, and Alcæus, who softened down our <lb/>
            music, wore a head-band, and practised soft Ionian airs ; 3 and <lb/>
            that Phrynichus,—for you have certainly 4 heard him,—was <lb/>
            both handsome himself and dressed handsomely. On this <lb/>
            account then his dramas also were handsome : for it is5 un­ <lb/>
            avoidable that one compose similarly to one's nature.</p>
          <p>MNES. On this account then Philocles,6 as he is ugly, com­ <lb/>
            poses uglily; and Xenocles,7 as he is vile, composes vilely; <lb/>
            and Theognis,8 again, as he is frigid, composes frigidly.</p>

            to state. My husband died in Cyprus, 1 having left behind <lb/>

            fore this3 I supported myself, indeed, but miserably.4 But <lb/>
            now this fellow by representing in his tragedies,5 has persuaded <lb/>
            the people that there are no gods; so that we do not now earn <lb/>
            even to the amount of one half. Now therefore I exhort <lb/>
            and charge all to punish this man for many reasons; for, 0 <lb/>
            women, he does savage deeds to us, as having been reared <lb/>
            himself among the potherbs8 in their wild state. But I will <lb/>

          <p>Or the date of the Eccleaiazusœ we are not informed by any Didas­ <lb/>
            calia. We learn, however, from a note of the Scholiast on vs. 193, <lb/>
            that it was brought on the stage two years after the league with the <lb/>
            Bœotians; consequently, in the spring of the year 392, B. c.; and, <lb/>
            (as may be inferred from the Scholiast on the Frogs, vs. 404,) at the <lb/>
            Great Dionysia. The Ecclesiazusœ is, like the Lysistrata, a picture <lb/>
            of woman's ascendency, but one much more depraved than the <lb/>
            other. In the dress of men the women steal into the public assem­ <lb/>
            bly, and by means of the majority of voices which they have thus <lb/>
            surreptitiously obtained, they decree a new constitution, in which <lb/>
            there is to be a community of goods and of women. This is a satire <lb/>
            on the ideal republics of the philosophers, with similar laws. Pro­ <lb/>
            tagoras had projected such before Plato. This comedy appears to <lb/>
            labour under the very same fault as the Peace: the introduction, <lb/>
            the secret assembly of the women, their rehearsal of their parts as <lb/>
            men, the description of the popular assembly, are all handled in the <lb/>
            most masterly manner; but towards the middle the action stands <lb/>
            still. Nothing remains but the representation of the perplexities <lb/>
            and confusion which arise from the different communities, especially <lb/>
            the community of women, and from the prescribed equality of rights <lb/>
            in love both for the old and ugly, and for the young and beautiful. <lb/>
            These perplexities are pleasant enough, but they turn too much on <lb/>
            a repetition of the same joke.</p><pb n="617"/>

              petticoat and shoes). What's the matter? Whither in the <lb/>
              world is my wife gone ? for it is now near1 morning, and she <lb/>
              does not appear. I have been lying this long while wanting <lb/>
              to ease myself, seeking to find my shoes and my garment <lb/>
              in the dark. And when now,2 on groping after it, I was not <lb/>
              able to find it, but he, Sir-reverence, now continued to knock <lb/>
              at the door,3 I take this kerchief of my wife's, and I trait <lb/>
              along her Persian slippers. But where, where could one ease <lb/>
              himself in an unfrequented4 place? or is every place a good <lb/>
              place:; by night? for now no one will see me easing myself. <lb/>
              Ah me, miserable! because I married a wife, being an old <lb/>
              man.6 How many stripes I deserve to get! For she never <lb/>
              went out to do any good. But nevertheless 1 must certainly <lb/>
              go aside to ease myself.</p>
          <p>A NEIGHBOUR (coming forward). Who is it ? Surely it <lb/>
            is not Blepyrus7 my neighbour? Yes, by Jove ! 'tis he him­ <lb/>
            self assuredly. [ Goes up to him.] Tell me, what means this <lb/>
            yellow8 colour? Cinesias has not, I suppose, befouled you <lb/>
            somehow ?</p>
          <p>BLEP. No; but I have come out with my wife's little <lb/>
            saffron-coloured robe9 on, which she is accustomed to put on.</p>
          <p>NEIGH. But where is your garment ?</p>
          <p>BLEP. I can't tell. For when I looked for it, I did not <lb/>
            find it in the bed-clothes.</p>
          <p>NEIGH. Then did you not even bid10 your wife tell you ? <note type="footnote"> 1 Cf. vs. 20. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Cf. vs. 195, supra. Lys. 523. Vesp. 121. Person, Append. <lb/>

          <p>BLEP. No, by Jove ! for she does not happen to be within% <lb/>
            but has slipped out1 from the house without my knowledge. <lb/>
            For which reason2 also I fear lest she be doing some mis­ <lb/>
            chief.3</p>
          <p>NEIGH. By Neptune, then you've suffered exactly the same <lb/>
            as I;4 for she I live with, is gone with the garment I used <lb/>
            to wear. And this is not the only thing 5 which troubles me; <lb/>
            but she has also taken my shoes. Therefore I was not able <lb/>
            to find them any where.</p>
          <p>BLEP. By Bacchus, neither could I my Laconian shoes! <lb/>
            but as I wanted to ease myself, I put my feet into my wife's 'a <lb/>
            buskins and am hastening, in order that I might not do it in <lb/>
            the blanket, for it was clean-washed.7</p>
          <p>NEIGH. What then can it be? Has some woman among <lb/>
            her friends invited her to breakfast ?</p>
          <p>BLEP. In my8 opinion it is so. She's certainly not an ill <lb/>
            body, as far as I know.</p>
          <p>NEIGH. Come, you are as long about it as the rope of a <lb/>

            the Spartans? [Exit.]</p>
          <p>BLEP. By Bacchus, at any rate it clings very tight to me <lb/>
            But what shall I do? for not even is this the only thing <lb/>
            which troubles me; but to know3 where the dung will go to <lb/>

            in the world he is, has bolted the door. Who then will go <lb/>
            for a doctor for me ? and which one ? Which of the breech­ <lb/>
            professors5 is clever in his art? Does Amynon6 know it? <lb/>
            But perhaps he will deny it. Let some one summon Antis­ <lb/>

            them, we compared them all to shoe-makers: for 6 the Assem­ <lb/>

            that, no one would have voted against it,-that the meal­ <lb/>
            hucksters should4 furnish three choenixes as5 supper to all <lb/>

            much1 ill of you.</p>
          <p>BLEP. Why, what did he say ?</p>
          <p>CHREM. First he said you were a knave.</p>
          <p>BLEP. And of you ?</p>

            [Points to the audience.]</p>
          <p>BLEP. Who denies this ? 2</p>
          <p>CHREM. A woman, on the other hand, he said was a clever <lb/>
            and money-getting thing; and he said they did not constantly <lb/>
            divulge the secrets of the Thesmophoria, while you and I al­ <lb/>
            ways did so when we were senators.</p>
          <p>BLEP. And, by Mercury, in this he did not lie!</p>
          <p>CHREM. Then he said they lent to 3 each other garments, <lb/>
            gold, silver, drinking-cups,4 all alone,5 not in the presence of <lb/>
            witnesses: and that they returned all these, and did not keep <lb/>
            them back ;6 while most of us, he said, did so.</p>
          <p>BLEP. Yes, by Neptune, in the presence of witnesses!</p>
          <p>CHREM. That they did not act the informer, did not bring <lb/>
            actions, nor put down the democracy; but he praised the <lb/>
            women for many good qualities, and for very many other <lb/>
            reasons.</p>
          <p>BLEP. What then was decreed ?</p>
          <p>CIIREM. To commit the state to them. For7 this plan <lb/>
            alone appeared not to have been tried as yet in the state.</p>

            by all means.</p>

          <p>BLEP. And shall we have a community of dung ?</p>
          <p>PRAX. No, by Jove! but you were the first to interrupt2 <lb/>
            me. For I was going to say this : I will first of all make the <lb/>
            land common to3 all, and the silver, and the other things, as <lb/>
            many as each has. Then we will maintain you out of these, <lb/>

            attention to it.</p>
          <p>BLEP. How then if any of us do not possess land, but silver <lb/>
            and Darics,4 personal5 property ?</p>
          <p>PRAX. He shall pay it in for the public use; and if he <lb/>

          <p>PRAX. Yes ; formerly, my good eir, when we used the for­ <lb/>

            what1 is the advantage of not paying in ?</p>
          <p>BLEP. If on seeing a girl any one should desire her and <lb/>
            wish to lie with her, he will be able2 to make presents by <lb/>
            taking from these; but he will enjoy a share of the common <lb/>
            property by sleeping with her.</p>
          <p>PRAX. But he will be permitted to sleep with her for <lb/>
            nothing ; for I will make3 them in common for the men to lie <lb/>
            with, and for any one that pleases to beget children.</p>
          <p>BLEP. How then, if all shall go to the most beautiful of <lb/>
            them and seek to lie with her ?</p>
          <p>PRAX. The uglier and more flat-nosed women shall sit by <lb/>
            the side of the beautiful;4 and then if any desire her,5 he <lb/>
            shall first lie with the ugly one.</p>
          <p>BLEP. Why, how shall our powers not6 fail us old men, <lb/>
            before we get there where you say, if we have to do with the <lb/>
            ugly ones first ?</p>

          <p>PRAX. But he who is standing by will not permit it. <lb/>
            Formerly2 they had no concern about other people's fathers, <lb/>
            if any one beat them; whereas now, if any hear a father <lb/>
            beaten, being alarmed lest any person should be beating his <lb/>

            one reason, I ween, if any one, being in debt, denies it.</p>
          <p>PRAX. Whence7 then did the lender lend the money, <lb/>
            when all things are in common ? He is, I ween, convicted of <lb/>
            theft.</p>
          <p>BLEP. By Ceres, you instruct us well! Now let some ones <lb/>
            tell me this: whence shall those who beat people pay off an <lb/>
            action for assault, when they insult people after a banquet? <lb/>

            <title type="sub">THE ARGUMENT</title>
          </ab>
          <p>"THE Plutus, according to an indubitable tradition, was twice <lb/>
            brought upon the stage; first, in the year 408, B. C., in the Archon­ <lb/>
            ship of Diodes, and then, in the year 388, B. c., in the Archonship <lb/>
            of Antipater. In its second representation, the Plutus contended <lb/>
            successfully against the "Lacedæmonians" of Nicochares, the <lb/>
            "Admetus " of Aristomenes, the " Adonis " of Nicophon, and the <lb/>
            "Pasiphae" of Alcaeus. The Greek Scholiasts frequently assert <lb/>
            that our present text is the first Plutus. This view is in decided con­ <lb/>
            tradiction to the play itself, which contains numerous allusions to <lb/>
            the times of the Archon Antipater. The opinion of later philologers, <lb/>
            which has been sanctioned by the great authority of Hemsterhuis, <lb/>
            represents our present text as a riffaccimento of the two editions. <lb/>
            But recent investigations have completely refuted this position. <lb/>
            We therefore may confidently assume that the Plutus we have be­ <lb/>
            fore us is just in the state in which Aristophanes in the latter years <lb/>
            of his life brought it on the stage." Droysen. See the Scholiast on <lb/>
            vs. 173. The argument is simply this:—Chremylus, a poor, but <lb/>
            just man, consults the Delphic oracle about his son, whether he <lb/>
            ought not to be instructed in injustice and knavery, and the other <lb/>
            arts whereby worldly men acquired riches. The god answered him <lb/>
            nothing plainly, but merely told him he was to follow whomsoever <lb/>
            he should first light upon on leaving the temple. The first person <lb/>
            he meets with is a blind old man. This turns out to be Plutus, the <lb/>

            extravagantly fat; but with me they are thin and slender, and <lb/>

            if any one should hear a noise, be must be silent, we all <lb/>

          <p>WIFE. O most daring1 of men, were you not afraid of the <lb/>
            god?</p>
          <p>CA. Yes, by the gods, lest he might get to the pot before me, <lb/>
            with his garlands on ; for his priest taught me that before­ <lb/>
            hand.2 But the old woman, when she heard my noise, <lb/>
            stretched forth3 her hand ; and then I hissed and seized it <lb/>
            with my teeth, as if I were an Æsculapian4 snake. But she <lb/>
            immediately drew back her hand again, and lay down, having <lb/>
            wrapped herself up quietly, farting for fear more offensively <lb/>
            than a weasel. And then I swallowed greedily the greater <lb/>
            part of the porridge :5 and then, when I was full, I rested.</p>
          <p>WIFE. But did not the god come to you ?</p>
          <p>CA. Not yet. And after this now I did a very laughable <lb/>
            thing indeed ; for as he was approaching, I farted very loudly ; <lb/>
            for my belly6 had been blown out.</p>
          <p>WIFE. Doubtless he was immediately disgusted at you on <lb/>
            account of this.</p>
          <p>CA. No ; but a certain laso,7 who was following along <lb/>
            with him, blushed a little, and Panacea took hold of her nose <lb/>
            and turned away her head ; for I fart no frankincense.</p>

          <p>MER. And yet whenever you stole 2 any little vessel from <lb/>
            your master, I always used 3 to cause you to be undetected.</p>
          <p>CA. On condition that you also shared yourself, you house­ <lb/>

            whenever I was caught in any knavery.</p>
          <p>MER. Don't bear malice, 5 if you have got possession of <lb/>
            Phyle; but, by the gods, receive me as a fellow-inmate.</p>
          <p>CA. Then will you abandon the gods and stay here ?</p>

          <p>PRIEST. Because they are all rich. And yet, at that time, <lb/>
            when they had nothing, the one, a merchant, used 7 to come and <lb/>
            sacrifice some victim for his safety; and some other one, be­ <lb/>

            used to sacrifice with favourable omens, and invite me too, the <lb/>
