          <p>IT is much to be regretted that the phallus-element should be so <lb/>
            conspicuous in the present Play; for, in other respects, there are few <lb/>
            dramas-ancient or modern-which contain more noble sentiments or <lb/>
            morepoetic beauty than the Lysistrata of Aristophanes.</p>
          <p>And in truththis very coarseness, so repulsive to ourselves, so amusing <lb/>
            to an Athenian audience, was introduced, it is impossible to doubt, for <lb/>
            the express purpose of counterbalancing the extreme gravity and earnest­ <lb/>
            ness of the Play The debate between Lysistrata and the Chief Magis­ <lb/>
            trate, her lecture to both Spartans and Athenians on their misdoings, <lb/>
            and even the beautifullyrics with which the drama concludes might, <lb/>
            unless framed in the most ludicrous and farcical setting, have well been <lb/>
            resented as too serious for-Comedy, as dealing with matters <foreign xml:lang="grc">μείζοναἢ</foreign> ’<foreign xml:lang="grc">πὶ <lb/>
            τρυγψδο</foreign>î<foreign xml:lang="grc">ς</foreign>. But none could objecton this score to wise counsels and <lb/>
            political censures delivered by a woman in Lysistrata's position ,-- and the <lb/>
            more practical her advice to the combatants becomes, the coarser the buf­ <lb/>
            foonery with which we find-it surrounded. That a Poet, from the boards <lb/>
            of an Athenian theatre, should, for example, recommend the Athenians, <lb/>
            for the sakeof Peace,.-to surrender Pylus, would hardly have been <lb/>
            tolerated unless therecommendation had been dressed up in the broadest <lb/>
            and most fantastical costume. The sorrows of Athenian mothers for <lb/>
            their sons, of Athenian maidens for their lovers, who hadgoneto the <lb/>
            battle-fields from which they never returned, would have been a topic far <lb/>
            toomoving and pathetic for Comedy, had it not been made a part of the <lb/>
            quarrel between the insurgent Women and the outraged Magistrate. <lb/>
            And amidst the wildest buffoonery, there is always perceptible an under­ <lb/>
            tone of sadness, and of genuine anxiety about the terrible position in <lb/>
            which at that moment Athens found herself placed.</p><pb n="X"/>
            
          <p>For the Play was written in the year 412 B.C. at the very darkest <lb/>
            period of the Peloponnesian War, the darkest, that is to say, before <lb/>
            the ultimate disaster of Aegospotami, and the consequent Fall of <lb/>
            Athens. It was produced at the commencement of the year 411 B.C., <lb/>
            but whether at the Lenaea or at the Great Dionysia, and with <lb/>
            what success, the scanty record which has come down to us contains <lb/>
            nothing to show. At the time when Aristophanes commenced it, he <lb/>
            must have felt grave doubt whether it would ever be exhibited in an <lb/>
            Athenian theatre.</p>
          <p>It was in the autumn of the year 413 that the news of the over­ <lb/>
            whelming catastrophe in Sicily reached the Athenian people. It was so <lb/>
            totally unexpected that at first they refused to believe it. They were <lb/>
            still dreaming of an ever-brightening future-anticipating daily the <lb/>
            surrender of Syracuse, to be followed by the immediate extension of their <lb/>
            power over the entire island, and, later, by the inclusion of the whole <lb/>
            Hellenic race within the triumphant Athenian Empire-when the fatal <lb/>
            blow fell. The flower of their fleets and armies, the most splendid <lb/>
            armaments that had ever left an Hellenic harbour, had been, not merely <lb/>
            defeated, but utterly annihilated : and their foremost citizens, their <lb/>
            political and military leaders, had perished in the general ruin. They <lb/>
            had few, and those their least serviceable, triremes remaining, and little <lb/>
            money wherewith to equip new ones. Their allies, even those which <lb/>
            were most important and had been esteemed the most faithful, were <lb/>
            everywhere falling away, each wishing, as in the days of Brasidas, to <lb/>
            be the first to revolt; so that Sparta was even embarrassed by the <lb/>
            applications which reached her from every part of the crumbling empire. <lb/>
            The victorious triremes of Syracuse were speeding over the sea; the <lb/>
            whole Peloponnesian Confederacy was stirred to new life and activity; <lb/>
            the States which had hitherto been neutral were now turning against <lb/>
            them; their foes were gathering in on every side to be present at the <lb/>
            downfall, now judged to be imminent, of the Tyrant City. The future <lb/>
            was wrapped in the darkest gloom; there was no gleam of hope in any <lb/>
            quarter of the horizon. They could no longer put faith in the promise of <lb/>
             <pb n="XI"/>
            their favourite oracle that Athens, after long toil and pain, should yet soar <lb/>
            for ever and ever as an Eagle in the clouds of heaven; the Eaglets wing <lb/>
            was broken, and the hunters were close upon her. Thucydides, in the first <lb/>
            chapter of his Eighth Book, paints with a few vigorous strokes the alarm <lb/>
            and utter hopelessness which prevailed in the city: nevertheless, he says, <lb/>
            they determined that they would not give in (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐδόκειχρῆναι μὴ ἐνδιδόναι</foreign>), <lb/>
            but would do all in their power, collecting timber and money from what­ <lb/>
            ever source they could, to build a new navy in the place of the fleets they <lb/>
            had lost. Amongst the various measures which they adopted to meet the <lb/>
            emergency, the most important, or at all events the most interesting to <lb/>
            a reader of the Lysistrata, was the creation of a Board of Ten Probuli, <lb/>
            a sort of Committee of Public Safety.</p>
          <p>This seems to have been a genuine effort on the part of the democracy <lb/>
            to protect itself against its own hasty impulses. The office of <foreign xml:lang="grc">Πόβουλοι</foreign>, <lb/>
            though new to the Athenian constitution, was common in Dorian states, <lb/>
            and is regarded by Aristotle as a distinctively oligarchical institution, <lb/>
            and as being, wherever it existed, superior to all other magistracies and <lb/>
            offices in the State. “ There are three supreme magistracies," he says in <lb/>
            one place, “ <foreign xml:lang="grc">νομοφύλακες, πρόβουλοι, βουλή</foreign>; and of these the <foreign xml:lang="grc">νομοφύλακες</foreign> <lb/>
            are an aristocratic institution, the <foreign xml:lang="grc">πρόβουλοι</foreign> an oligarchic, and the <foreign xml:lang="grc">βουλὴ</foreign> <lb/>
            democratic1.” And again speaking of <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἡ τῶνπροβούλωνἀρχὴ</foreign> he says “<foreign xml:lang="grc">αὕτη <lb/>
            οὐ δημοκρτικὴ, βουλὴ δὲ δημοτικόν</foreign>. For there must be some power whose <lb/>
            business it is to devise measures to be laid before the Demus; and this <lb/>
            power, if few in number, is oligarchic; but <foreign xml:lang="grc">πρόβουλοι</foreign>are of necessity <lb/>
            few in number, and so they are oligarchic. And where <foreign xml:lang="grc">πρόβουλοι</foreign> and <lb/>
            a <foreign xml:lang="grc">βουλὴ</foreign>coexist in the same State, the <foreign xml:lang="grc">πρόβουλοι</foreign> are set over the <foreign xml:lang="grc">βουλή</foreign> ; <lb/>
            for the <foreign xml:lang="grc">βουλευτὴς</foreign> is democratic, but the <foreign xml:lang="grc">πρόβουλοι</foreign> oligarchic2.” And <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BELL_07_fig1.jpg"/></figure> <lb/>
               <pb n="XII"/>
              elsewhere, speaking of what he describes as the supreme magistracy in <lb/>
              the State, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἡ μάλιϭτα κυρία πάντων ἀρχὴ</foreign>,he says that the power which <lb/>
              convenes the assemblies is sometimes called <foreign xml:lang="grc">πρόβουλοι, διὰ</foreign>a <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸ προβου­ <lb/>
              λεύειν</foreign>, but in a democracy it is called <foreign xml:lang="grc">βουλή</foreign>1. And in yet another <lb/>
              passage where he is considering the share which under the various con­ <lb/>
              stitutions the Demus has, or ought to have, in the government, he says, <lb/>
              “In oligarchies it is expedient either to co-opt some persons out of the <lb/>
              Demus, or else to establish a magistracy (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀρχεῖον</foreign>) such as those which <lb/>
              exist in some states under the name of <foreign xml:lang="grc">Πρόβουλοι</foreign> or <foreign xml:lang="grc">Νομοφύλακες</foreign>, and <lb/>
              for the Demus to deliberate and decide upon matters laid before them by <lb/>
              that magistracy; for so the Demus will have a share in the decisions, <lb/>
              but will be unable to upset anything in the constitution2.”</p>
          <p>In all these passages Aristotle is not describing the position of the <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">Πρόβουλοι</foreign> in any particular State; he is considering the meaning which <lb/>
            the Hellenic people in general attached to the name and office of flpo­ <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">βουλοι</foreign>. And it seems impossible to doubt that the Board of <foreign xml:lang="grc">Πρόβουλοι</foreign> <lb/>
            established by the Athenians in their hour of danger were <foreign xml:lang="grc">Πρόβουλοιι</foreign>n <lb/>
            the ordinary acceptation of the word.3 And with this the presentation <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BELL_07_fig2.jpg"/></figure> <note type="footnote">In the Polity of Athens (chap. 29) Aristotle mentions the <foreign xml:lang="grc">δέκα πρβουλοι</foreign> <lb/>
              now appointed, but says nothing as to their duties. Thucydides (viii. 1) describes <lb/>
              them as an <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀρχὴν πρεϭβυτέρων ἀνδρῶν οἵτινες περὶτῶνπαρόων, ὡςἂνκαιρὸς ἦ, <lb/>
              πρυβουλεύϭουϭιν</foreign>. Mr. Grote, naturally indignant at the notion that a democracy <lb/>
              in its hour of peril should attempt to save itself by adopting an oligarchic <lb/>
              institution, flings all the authorities overboard. "The passages in Aristotle's <lb/>
              Politics, wherein the word <foreign xml:lang="grc">Πρόβουλοι</foreign> occurs, will not authorize any inference <lb/>
              with respect to this Board in the special case of Athens." “I cannot think it </note> <lb/>
               <pb n="XIII"/>
              of the <foreign xml:lang="grc">Πρόβουλος</foreign>, in the present Comedy is in complete accord. He is <lb/>
              attended by, and issues his orders to, the Scythian archers whom else­ <lb/>
              where-in the Acharnians, the Knights, and the Thesmophoriazusae—we <lb/>
              find attending upon, and obeying the orders of, the (<foreign xml:lang="grc">βουλή</foreign>; it is he who <lb/>
              comes, not as an agent for others but in his own right, to the Acropolis, <lb/>
              to obtain the means of rebuilding the fleet; to him, and not to Council <lb/>
              or Ecclesia, Lysistrata develops her scheme of reform; and when the <lb/>
              negotiations for Peace commence, he leaves the stage for the purpose of <lb/>
              telling, not asking, the <foreign xml:lang="grc">βουλὴ</foreign> to send plenipotentiaries to treat with those <lb/>
              who have arrived from Sparta. We have already in the Acharnians <lb/>
              seen the <foreign xml:lang="grc">Πρόβουλοι</foreign> of Megara, as the supreme authority, taking counsel <lb/>
              as to the best course to be pursued by the State.</p>
          <p>Of these Probuli we know the names of two 1; Sophocles, probably <lb/>
            but not certainly the Poet, and Hagnon the colonizer of Amphipolis and <lb/>
            the father of Theramenes. The others were doubtless also citizens in <lb/>
            whose integrity and capacity the greatest reliance was placed; and so far <lb/>
            as the conduct of the war was concerned they thoroughly justified their <lb/>
            selection. Never perhaps since the great days of the Persian Wars does <lb/>
            Athens so entirely claim our sympathy and admiration as when, under <lb/>
            the guidance of these Probuli, she set herself, without ships, without <lb/>
            money, and without hope, to prepare for what both she and her enemies <lb/>
            considered her last struggle not merely for Empire but for her own <lb/>
            existence. The terrible calamity which had befallen the city had <lb/>
            sobered all classes; the voice of the demagogue was hushed; and the <lb/>
            people were content to adopt with docility the measures devised for them <lb/>
            by their wisest heads. <note type="footnote"> admissible to draw inferences as to the functions of this Board of Probuli now <lb/>
            constituted from the proceedings of the Probulus in Aristophanis Lysistrata." <lb/>
            He gives no reason for either of these surprising propositions. </note><note type="footnote"> 1 As to Sophocles, see Aristotle's Rhetoric iii. 18. As to Hagnon, see Lysias <lb/>
            against Eratosthenes, 66 (p. 126), where he is described merely as <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὁπτὴρ του̂ <lb/>
            θηραμένους</foreign>. The notion that Theramenes was the adopted, and not the real, <lb/>
            son of Hagnon, seems to have arisen from a misunderstanding of the joke in <lb/>
            Frogs 970, where see the Commentary. </note></p><pb n="XIV"/>
            
          <p>The first and most pressing necessity was the creation and equipment <lb/>
            of a competent navy. This would of course require a very large ex­ <lb/>
            penditure, and how were they to obtain the money ? Fortunately at the <lb/>
            very outset of the war a sum of 1,000 talents had been set apart out of <lb/>
            the money in the Acropolis as a reserve to be used only in the event of <lb/>
            an actual attack upon the city by a hostile fleet; and for any person who <lb/>
            proposed, or put to the vote, a resolution for diverting it to any other <lb/>
            purpose, the penalty decreed was death1. That reserve had never been <lb/>
            touched; the need for it had never arisen. Nor had the specified event <lb/>
            occurred even now. But since the disaster in Sicily, Athens had been <lb/>
            expecting to see the triumphant Syracusan triremes bearing down upon <lb/>
            Peiraeus2; and she had nothing to oppose to them comparable with those <lb/>
            magnificent fleets which they had already, in fair fight, defeated and <lb/>
            destroyed. And when the most powerful of her subject allies—Chios <lb/>
            with its 60 triremes, Lesbos, Euboea, and others-were going over to <lb/>
            the enemy, it was practically certain that she would before long- be <lb/>
            attacked by sea as well as by land, unless she could forthwith ex­ <lb/>
            temporize a new navy capable of holding its own. So then, no doubt by <lb/>
            the advice of the Probuli, two resolutions were passed; one, revoking the <lb/>
            death-penalty, the other authorizing the immediate employment of the <lb/>
            thousand talents for ship-building purposes.</p>
          <p>The money having been thus provided, the next step was to provide <lb/>
            a sufficient supply of timber. This was always a difficulty with the <lb/>
            Athenians, for Attica itself could supply little for building triremes, and <lb/>
            in particular for making the oars which had to be extremely strong and, <lb/>
            especially for the upper tiers of rowers, of very great length also. <lb/>
            Almost all the timber they required they were oblig-cd to import; most <lb/>
            of it came from Macedonia3. One of the benefits which they hoped to <note type="footnote"> 1 Thuc. ii. 24, viii. 15. </note> <figure type="illustration">

              obtain from their anticipated conquest of Sicily and South Italy1 was <lb/>
              a plentiful supply of timber for building triremes; and in later times <lb/>
              a potentate could have no surer passport to the gratitude of the Athenian <lb/>
              people than by making them a gift of timber 2 for that purpose. In the <lb/>
              present crisis Thucydides suggests, rather than states, the difficulty by <lb/>
              saying in the first instance that the Athenians resolved to create a navy3, <lb/>
              procuring timber and money from whatever quarter they could; and after­ <lb/>
              wards, that they did in fact proceed with their ship-building4 having <lb/>
              procured timber. And doubtless there were many still friendly to Athens <lb/>
              who would be willing, if they could, to supply her necessities; and others <lb/>
              would do the same as a commercial speculation. We have in the speech <lb/>
              of Andocides de Reditu suo an interesting little notice about a cargo of <lb/>
              ship-timber brought from Macedonia for the use of the Athenian navy, <lb/>
              certainly a very few months, possibly a very few weeks, after the pro­ <lb/>
              duction of the Lysistrata. Andocides is endeavouring to show that even <lb/>
              during the period of his enforced absence from Athens, he was doing <lb/>
              what he could to benefit the State. And he tells us that King <lb/>
              Archelaus, the son and successor of Perdiccas, being his hereditary friend, <lb/>
              gave him leave to cut down and export as much timber as he liked for <lb/>
              oar-spars. Accordingly he at once brought a cargo of oar-spars, <foreign xml:lang="grc">κωπέας</foreign>, <lb/>
              to the armament at Samos, and though he might have sold them, he <lb/>
              says, at the rate of five drachmas apiece, he declined to receive anything <lb/>
              beyond what they had cost himself. And, magnifying his own merits, he <note type="footnote"> [Demosthenes], against Timotheus 1192,1194-6 ; Theophrastus, Characters, chap. 23 <lb/>

              declares that but for the supplies he brought the question would have been, <lb/>
              not whether the armament could save Athens, but whether it could itself <lb/>
              be saved. The date of the transaction is fixed by the statement that the <lb/>
              Four Hundred were then in power. Andocides, expecting nothing but <lb/>
              praise and gratitude for the important service he had rendered, passed on <lb/>
              from Samos to Athens, and found to his dismay that the relations <lb/>
              between the armament at Samos and the Four Hundred at Athens were <lb/>
              so hostile, that he was at once arrested and brought before the Council <lb/>
              on a charge of having supplied corn and oar-spars1 to "the enemy," and, <lb/>
              according to his own account, narrowly escaped with his life. And he <lb/>
              bewails his singular ill-fortune in being imprisoned (1) when the demo­ <lb/>
              cracy was in power, for having wronged the Demus [in the affair of the <lb/>
              mutilation of the Hermae], and (2) when the oligarchy was in power, for <lb/>
              having befriended the Demus.</p>
          <p>The foregoing little narrative illustrates in a striking manner the scene <lb/>
            in the Lysistrata, where the <foreign xml:lang="grc">Πρόβουλος</foreign> is hastening to the treasury in the <lb/>
            Acropolis, now replenished by the thousand talents, to obtain money for the <lb/>
            immediate purchase of—what ? <foreign xml:lang="grc">κωέας</foreign>, the very articles which at this <lb/>
            moment Andocides, knowing how sorely they were needed, was preparing <lb/>
            to bring from Macedonia across the Aegaean to the Athenian navy.</p>
          <p>Nothing could have been more judicious, or in its results more <lb/>
            effective, than the measures carried into execution under the auspices of <lb/>
            the Probuli for the immediate protection of Athens. But it is impossible <lb/>
            for a Board to excite the enthusiasm or inspire the confidence which <lb/>
            might be willingly accorded to an individual leader of tried capacity and <lb/>
            integrity. And we can well believe, without the testimony of Lysistrata <lb/>
            (lines 523, 524), that the citizens would soon be found inquiring in the <lb/>
            streets whether there was no MAN in the land who would guide them <note type="footnote"> 1 The charge was made by Peisander, the Stormy Petrel of the oligarchic revolu­ <lb/>

              into the way of safety. Enough may have been done to stave off the <lb/>
              peril of an immediate collapse of the Athenian defence; but not enough <lb/>
              to justify the slightest hope that Athens would survive the termination of <lb/>
              the war. Almost at the very time when the Lysistrata was being <lb/>
              exhibited, Peisander, finding his oligarchical proposals strongly opposed, <lb/>
              asked his opponents, one by one, whether apart from his proposals they <lb/>
              had any hope that the City could be saved1; and they, one and all, <lb/>
              replied that they had no hope. Nor was it till much later in the <lb/>
              year 411 that the people ventured to entertain even a hope that they <lb/>
              might yet be able to emerge in safety from the War. For months the <lb/>
              two main fleets-that of the Athenians on the one hand, and that of the <lb/>
              Peloponnesians, Sicilians, and their own disaffected allies on the other­ <lb/>
              had been manoeuvring amongst the islands off the coast of Asia Minor, <lb/>
              unwilling to risk everything on the hazard of a decisive engagement. <lb/>
              But at length a general battle took place in the narrow waters of the <lb/>
              Hellespont, and the Athenians, under the command of Thrasyllus and <lb/>
              Thrasybulus, found themselves, apparently somewhat to their own stir­ <lb/>
              prise, the victors of a fleet more numerous than their own. Thucydides <lb/>
              tells us that when the news of this unhoped for good fortune arrived at <lb/>
              Athens the people were greatly encouraged, and thought that with <lb/>
              energy and perseverance they might yet be able to surmount their <lb/>
              difficulties 2. Moreover they had then found a MAN in whose capacity, <lb/>
              at all events, they could place the utmost reliance; one who, had his <lb/>
              character been equal to his genius, would have stood in the very foremost <lb/>
              rank of Hellenic statesmen. Alcibiades, who in 412 had been the leading <lb/>
              spirit of the Spartan counsels, had now again thrown in his lot with <lb/>
              Athens, and had already done her a service than which, as Thucydides <lb/>
              says, no man ever rendered her a greater, and which no man but he <lb/>
              would have been able to render her at the existing crisis. For at once, <figure type="illustration">

              on his arrival at Samos, he showed his superiority to the ordinary faction- <lb/>
              leaders and demagogues who were the curse of Athens, by preventing <lb/>
              the outbreak, then imminent, of a fratricidal war between the armament <lb/>
              at Samos and the Government at Athens, and so paving the way for <lb/>
              that happy compromise which produced what Thucydides considers to <lb/>
              have been the best constitution that Athens had ever, in his lifetime, <lb/>
              enjoyed. But all this took place long afterwards. At the time when <lb/>
              the present Comedy was composed and exhibited the prospect before the <lb/>
              Athenians was one of unrelieved gloom. It was in a period of hopeless <lb/>
              despondency that Lysistrata developed her original scheme for a general <lb/>
              pacification of the warring Hellenic states.</p>
          <p>“ The Lysistrata of Aristophanes, in some of its scenes," says the late <lb/>
            Bishop Wordsworth of Lincoln, is the best topographical guide-book to <lb/>
            the Athenian Acropolis." (Athens and Attica, chap. xiv ad fin.) For <lb/>
            the whole actionof the Comedy is concerned with the Acropolis. The <lb/>
            scene is, throughout, the open space before its entrance; and its seizure <lb/>
            by the Women, and the manner in which they hold it against the Men, <lb/>
            constitute the central events around which are grouped all the various <lb/>
            incidents of the Play. And it may perhaps assist unlearned readers (for <lb/>
            whom alone the following remarks are intended) to realize and appreciate <lb/>
            the setting of the Comedy, if we devote a few pages to the illustration of <lb/>
            the locality in which the action of the Play is supposed to be carried on. <lb/>
            The Acropolis itself, the original Athens, is an isolated rock, rising to <lb/>
            a height of about 500 feet above the level of the sea. In its natural <lb/>

            ACROPOLIS. <lb/>

            irregular, but it was levelled by the Pelasgians, the prc- <lb/>
            Hellenic inhabitants of the land; and, as levelled, became <lb/>
            an elevated plateau about 1,000 feet long and 450 feet broad at its <lb/>
            widest part. Its contour is shown on the accompanying Plan. This <lb/>
            plateau they surrounded with a wall1 (TO <foreign xml:lang="grc">Πελαϭγικὸν</foreign>) which lasted, <note type="footnote"> 1 Suidas in two places, s.v. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἄπεδα</foreign>and s.v. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἠπέδιζον</foreign>, quotes from Cleidemus (or <lb/>

              apparently unaltered, till the time of the Persian invasion. But then, <lb/>
              during the double occupation of Athens, first under Xerxes himself and <lb/>
              afterwards under Mardonius, not only was the great Temple of Athene, <lb/>
              the Erechtheium, set on fire, but all the other buildings of the Acropolis, <lb/>
              including the wall, were thrown down, and consumed in one general <lb/>
              conflagration1. The portion of the Wall which was most completely <lb/>
              demolished was that on the southern side of the plateau; and this, some <lb/>
              fourteen years later, was rebuilt by Cimon with the money arising from <lb/>
              the spoil obtained in his expedition to the Eurymedon 2. The rest of the <lb/>
              wall seems to have been merely restored out of its old materials and <lb/>
              the ruins of the other edifices destroyed by the Persians. The southern <lb/>
              wall is therefore commonly called the " Cimonian," and the rest the <lb/>
              " Pelasgian." But even the restoration by Hellenic hands of the <lb/>
              " Pelasgian" wall must have radically changed its character; and <lb/>
              modern antiquaries are unable to detect any traces of pre-Hellenic work <lb/>
              except in the little strip on the western side of the Acropolis, imme­ <lb/>
              diately to the south of the Propylaea.</p>
          <p>The entire Acropolis was holy ground 3 ; and in the present Play it is <lb/>
            styled “a holy Temple," “a holy sanctuary," <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἱερὸς</foreign>mos, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἱερὸντέμνος</foreign> <lb/>
            (lines 483, 775); and with greater particularity “Athene's mansion," <lb/>
            "the acropolis of the Goddess" (lines 241, 345). For numerous as were <lb/>
            the Temples and statues which adorned its summit, they were all domi­ <lb/>
            nated by the triple presentment4 of Athene as the <foreign xml:lang="grc">Πολιὰς</foreign>, the <foreign xml:lang="grc">Παρθένς</foreign>, <figure type="illustration">

              and the <foreign xml:lang="grc">Πρόμαχος</foreign>. The <foreign xml:lang="grc">Πολιὰς</foreign> dwelt in the Ereehtheium; the <foreign xml:lang="grc">Παρθένος</foreign> <lb/>
              in the Parthenon; the <foreign xml:lang="grc">Πρόμαχος</foreign> was merely a colossal statue in the <lb/>
              open, without any Temple attached to it.</p>
          <p>The Erechtheium was the most ancient Temple in Athens, it had been <lb/>
            in existence for many centuries before the Persian invasion, and was the <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἱερὸν</foreign> which, Herodotus tells us, was pillaged and fired <lb/>
            by the invaders. It is mentioned by Homer under the <lb/>

              enshrined, TO <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀρχαῖον ἄγαλμα</foreign>, a simple olive-wood statue, was supposed to <lb/>
              be no mere product of human art, but to have fallen down from Heaven <lb/>
              (Pausanias i. 26. 7). It was indeed identified with the famous Palladium <lb/>
              of Troy which, the story went, was carried from the captured city by the <lb/>
              hero Diomed. His ships, on the return voyage, were driven by night on <lb/>
              the coast of Attica; and the troops, not knowing whither they had <lb/>
              arrived, and believing the country to be hostile, betook themselves to <lb/>

            On the knees of Athene she laid it, the Maid of the glorious hair, <lb/>
            And she cried to the daughter of Zeus most high with vow and prayer."</p>
          <p>Pausanias (i. 26. 7) will not commit himself to any decided opinion as to <lb/>
            whether the wooden statue did, or did not, actually fall down from <lb/>
            Heaven; but he tells us that whereas all Athens, and indeed all Attica, <lb/>
            was Athene's soil, yet of all her innumerable sanctuaries and representa­ <lb/>
            tions, the wooden image in the Acropolis was accounted of all men the <lb/>
            most sacred, <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸ ἁγιώτατον πάντων</foreign>. Hellenic architects could build more <lb/>
            majestic temples; Hellenic sculptors could conceive and execute far <lb/>
            grander representations of the national Goddess; but they could not <lb/>
            invest their creations with the religious awe which hung around the <lb/>
            simple wooden figure of the Erechtheium, the mysterious Palladium of <lb/>
            the Athenian people. Hence it was commonly called merely <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸ παλαιὸν <lb/>
            βρέτας</foreign>, To <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀρχαῖον ἄγαλμα</foreign>, or even <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸ ἅγιον</foreign> OpEras. In this very Play <lb/>
            (line 262) the Chorus of Men exclaim against the Women for having <lb/>
            seized the Acropolis and taken possession of <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸ ἅγιον βρέτας</foreign>, as if there <lb/>
            were no other sacred statue in the entire Acropolis. In the Eumenides <lb/>
             <pb n="XXIV"/>
            (line 80) Apollo, advising Orestes how to be purged from the guilt of <lb/>
            matricide, says Go to the City of Pallas, and there take thy seat, embracing <lb/>
            the ancient statue, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἵζου παλαιὸν ἄγκαθεν λαβὼν βρέτας</foreign>. He does not think <lb/>
            it necessary to say whose statue; he does not even use the definite article. <lb/>
            There is in the British Museum a lengthy inscription brought by <lb/>
            Chandler from Athens recording the state of the works at the Erech­ <lb/>
            theium in the archonship of Diodes B.C. 409-408, some three years before <lb/>
            the second conflagration; and in this inscription the Temple is called, <lb/>
            not the Erechtheium, but <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὁ νεὼς ὁ ἐν πόλει, ἐν ᾧ</foreign> TO <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀρχαῖον ἄγαλμα</foreign>. The <lb/>
            inscription is given, with a Latin translation and copious annotations, in <lb/>
            Müller's treatise mentioned in the note on page xxii, and by Boeckh in the <lb/>
            Corpus Ins. Graec., No. 160 ; and, with an English translation, in Stuart <lb/>
            and Revett's Antiquities. Before this sacrosanct image a golden lamp <lb/>
            was always burning day and night, a lamp so fashioned that it contained <lb/>
            exactly sufficient oil to last an entire year, and accordingly required to be <lb/>
            replenished only once a year; whence in Strabo ix. 1. 16 the Temple is <lb/>
            called <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὁ ἀρχαῖος νεὼς ὁ τῆς Πολιάδος, ἐν ᾧ</foreign> o <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἄσβεστος λύχνος</foreign>. And it was <lb/>
            somewhere in the precincts of the Temple that the little Mystery- <lb/>
            Maidens, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀρρηφόροι</foreign>, mentioned in line 641 of this Play, or at all events <lb/>
            the two of them who assisted the priestesses in embroidering the <lb/>
            Panathenaic <foreign xml:lang="grc">πέπλος</foreign>, were lodged during their term of office. Here too <lb/>
            was the abode of the sacred serpent, whose opportune disappearance when <lb/>
            the Persians were approaching the City gave such efficient assistance to <lb/>
            the plans of Themistocles. It may indeed be said with truth that all <lb/>
            the sacred traditions and ritual observances of Athene clustered around the <lb/>
            Erechtheium. They had no doubt done so long before the Parthenon <lb/>
            was built. And as we know that the National Treasury was in the <lb/>
            Acropolis, in Athene's Temple, Trapa <foreign xml:lang="grc">τᾷ σιῷ</foreign> as Lampito says in line 174 <lb/>
            of this Comedy, it would a priori seem probable that it was placed under <lb/>
            the protection of the Goddess in her most sacred and venerated sanc­ <lb/>
            tuary. But before considering this subject, it is necessary to make a few <lb/>
            observations upon the structure and internal arrangement of the <lb/>
            Erechtheium.</p><pb n="XXV"/>
            
          <p>The particulars of the Erechtheium were first made known by Stuart <lb/>
            and Revett in the second volume of their great work on the Antiquities <lb/>
            of Athens. They described it as a conglomeration of three buildings, not <lb/>
            all on the same level; and they called these three buildings (wrongly, as <lb/>
            I think) "the Temples of Erechtheus, Minerva Polias, and Pandrosus," <lb/>
            taking the section marked B in the accompanying Plan to be the Temple <lb/>
            of Erechtheus; that marked C to be the Temple of the Polias; and the <lb/>
            small section to the south of D to be the Temple of Pandrosus. In this <lb/>
            small section the roof was supported by the female figures known as <lb/>
            Caryatides, one of which is now in the British Museum. C. O. Müller, <lb/>
            however, in the treatise to which reference has already been made, <lb/>
            considers the section marked D to have been itself the Temple of <lb/>
            Pandrosus. Mr. Fergusson, in a paper read before the Royal Institute <lb/>
            of British architects on the 14th of February, 1876, and published in the <lb/>
            " Sessional Papers, 1875, 1876, No. 8" of that Institute, would relegate <lb/>
            the Temple of Pandrosus to a further building, of which all traces are <lb/>
            now lost, but which he imagines to have extended to the west of the <lb/>
            existing ruins; and other writers have sought to provide for it in other <lb/>
            quarters. In fact, the Erechtheium has acquired quite a literature of its <lb/>
            own, mainly concerned with the attempt to locate three Temples in <lb/>
            a building apparently designed for two only. It seems to me that all <lb/>
            this ingenuity is misplaced; and that the Erechtheium never in fact <lb/>
            comprised more than two complete Temples, one of Poseidon-Erechtheus, <lb/>
            and the other of Athene-Pandrosus.</p>
          <p>The original Erechtheium belongs to prehistoric times and was appro­ <lb/>
            priated to the worship of two Autochthonic deities, Erechtheus ('<foreign xml:lang="grc">Ερεχ­ <lb/>
            θῆος</foreign> TOV <foreign xml:lang="grc">γηγενέος</foreign>, Hdt. viii. 55 ; <foreign xml:lang="grc">τέκε δὲ ζείδωρος" Αρουρα</foreign>, Iliad ii. 548, <lb/>
            cited in a preceding note) and Pandrosus. Erechtheus was the primeval <lb/>
            Earth-shaker1, the power whose might could divide the ground, and open <lb/>
            or dry up fountains; Pandrosus represented the all-bedewing, all- <note type="footnote"> 1 '<foreign xml:lang="grc">Ερεχθεύς· παρὰ</foreign> TO <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐρέχθω, τὸ κινῶ· δι' αὐτοῦ</foreign> yap <foreign xml:lang="grc">οἱ σεισμοί</foreign>.—Tzetzes on Lycophron <lb/>
            431. We are here of course considering Erechtheus and Pandrosus merely as <lb/>
            objects of worship, and not in their human character. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="XXVI"/>
            refreshing influence attributed to the lunar radiance. But as the <lb/>
            Hellenic race, or culture, superseded the indigenous people, or culture, of <lb/>
            Attica, it was natural that the Hellenic deities should supersede the <lb/>
            deities of the older religion. The building itself was allowed to retain <lb/>
            the name of Erechtheus, but his worship, if continued at all, was con­ <lb/>
            tinued under the title of Poseidon, the Hellenic Earth-shaker, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐνοσίχθων, <lb/>
            ἐννοσίγαιος</foreign>; whilst the Virgin Goddess, Athene, the prime object of <lb/>
            worship in the new order of things, naturally took the place which <lb/>
            Pandrosus held under the older system. And thence I imagine it was <lb/>
            that Athene1, in addition to her ordinary attributes, became sometimes <lb/>
            identified with the Moon, and that some Athenian coins displayed a <lb/>
            lunar emblem 2 in conjunction with the olive-branch and owl of Pallas.</p>
          <p>In this way, as it seems to me, Poseidon superseded Erechtheus as the <lb/>
            supreme deity in one section, and Athene superseded Pandrosus as the <lb/>
            supreme deity in the other. In each section however altars were erected, <lb/>
            and worship offered to other powers, as to Hephaestus and Butes3 in <lb/>
            Poseidon's Temple and to Zeus Herceius4 in Athene's. It would seem <lb/>
            too that though Erechtheus became altogether merged in his supplanter <lb/>
            Poseidon, yet the dethroned Pandrosus still retained a chapel or compart­ <lb/>
            ment, close to Athene's shrine, in the Temple of the Polias. This is <note type="footnote"> 1 " Aristoteles ... Minervam esse Lunam probabilibus argumentis explicat, et <lb/>

              would draw from it that the Pandroseium was on a lower level than the Temple <lb/>
              of the Polias. It means simply having disappeared within, having penetrated into, <lb/>
              and involves no idea of descent. </note> <lb/>

              shown by the incident quoted from Philochorus in the preceding note, <lb/>
              and also from the statement of Pausanias that the shrine of Pandrosus1 <lb/>
              was contiguous to the shrine of Athene.</p>
          <p>But the mere substitution of Poseidon and Athene for Erechtheus and <lb/>
            Pandrosus was not enough to satisfy the loyal aspirations of Athenian <lb/>
            religion. The name Erechtheium is itself sufficient to show that, in the <lb/>
            original arrangement of the Temple, Erechtheus was considered a superior <lb/>
            power to the female Pandrosus; but it was not to be tolerated that the <lb/>
            national Goddess should hold in the national Temple a secondary place <lb/>
            even to the great Poseidon. The transfer of the primacy from Poseidon <lb/>
            to Athene is symbolized in the old legend as the result of an actual <lb/>
            dispute between the two Powers with reference to the priority of their <lb/>
            respective occupations of the platform of the Acropolis2. Poseidon had <lb/>
            really come there first, and smote the ground with his trident, so that <lb/>
            the salt waters gushed forth; but he did not take the precaution of <lb/>
            securing a witness to his act. Athene, when she planted her olive, <lb/>
            called Cecrops to witness that she did so; and on the strength of his <lb/>
            evidence she was adjudged by the assembled Gods to be the Patroness <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Τῷ ναῷ τῆς Ἀθηνᾶς Πανδρόσου ναὸς συνεχής ἐστι</foreign>.—Pausanias i. 27. 3. It is hardly <lb/>

              and Guardian of the City. The legend was evidently suggested by the <lb/>
              fact that a pool of salt water existed in, or in connexion with, one of <lb/>
              the two Temples, whilst an olive-tree grew in, or in connexion1 with, <lb/>
              the other. Thenceforward, Athene reigned as the undisputed Mistress <lb/>
              of the City, the <foreign xml:lang="grc">Πολιὰς</foreign>, the <foreign xml:lang="grc">Πολιοῦχος</foreign>, the "Praeses arcis et urbis."</p>
          <p>Long after the commencement of the Christian era, the olive, the pool <lb/>
            of salt water, and the mark of Poseidon's trident were shown to Pausanias <lb/>
            within the precincts of the Erechtheium.</p>
          <p>Such, in my opinion, is the most probable account of the development <lb/>
            of the Erechtheian worship. Poseidon superseded Erechtheus in the one <lb/>
            Temple; Athene superseded Pandrosus in the other; and though Poseidon <lb/>
            had the earlier'claim to the primacy, it ultimately fell to Athene. And <lb/>
            the architectural puzzle of arranging three Temples in a building only <lb/>
            designed for two does not really exist. There never were more than two <lb/>
            distinct Temples, though there were many shrines, in the one Erechtheium. <lb/>
            In corroboration of the foregoing view I would point out the following <lb/>
            circumstances.</p>
          <p>1. Poseidon was known at Athens by the name of Erechtheus, and <lb/>
            Athene by that of Pandrosus, from the deities whom they respectively <lb/>
            superseded 2. <note type="footnote"> 1 That the olive-tree was in a court, corridor, or other place open to the sky is <lb/>
            to be inferred not merely from the nature of the case, but also from the statement <lb/>
            of Philochorus quoted in a preceding note that it overhung the altar of Z<foreign xml:lang="grc">εὺς</foreign> ’<foreign xml:lang="grc">Ερκεῖος</foreign>, <lb/>
            for that altar was always in the open. See Odyssey xxii. 334, with the note of <lb/>

          <p>2. The pool of salt water which Poseidon called forth from the rock <lb/>
            would of course be in his Temple, but being called the <foreign xml:lang="grc">θάλασσα</foreign> <lb/>
            ’<foreign xml:lang="grc">Ερεχθηῒς</foreign> it was also no doubt in the Temple of Erechtheus. The olive- <lb/>
            tree which Athene planted must needs have been in her Temple, yet <lb/>
            Philochorus and Apollodorus say that it was in the Pandroseium.</p>
          <p>3. Athene Polias and Poseidon (or Erechtheus) are constantly spoken <lb/>
            of as the two co-tenants of the Temple without any mention of Pandrosus <lb/>
            as a sharer in their dignity. Thus in Plutarch's Symposiacs (ix. 6) one <lb/>
            guest says to another “ Don't be intractable like Aias, but go rather with <lb/>
            Poseidon. He was worsted by Athene, but he shares with her the <lb/>
            Temple; and an altar of Lethe is set up therein." Herodotus (v. 82) <lb/>
            tells us that the Athenians gave the Epidaurians one of their sacred <lb/>
            olive-trees, on condition that the Epidaurians should every year bring <lb/>
            a sacrifice to Athene Polias and Erechtheus. And Aristeides (Panath. <lb/>
            107, 7, vol. i. 170, ed. Dind.) says that Erechtheus is the <foreign xml:lang="grc">πάρεδρος</foreign> of <lb/>
            Athene.</p>
          <p>From the Erechtheium, one of the most elegant specimens of the Ionic <lb/>
            order of architecture, we pass to the Parthenon, one of the most perfect <lb/>
            specimens of the Doric. The architect of the Parthenon <lb/>
            was Ictinus, as we are told by both Pausanias (viii. 41. 5) <lb/>
            and Strabo (ix. 1. 16). Plutarch indeed (Pericles 13) <lb/>
            THE <lb/>
            PARTHENON. <lb/>
            couples Ictinus and Callicrates as the joint architects; but in a matter of <lb/>
            this kind his authority is unequal to that of either Pausanias or Strabo; <lb/>
            and even if Callicrates assisted in some part of the work, we may be <lb/>
            sure that the plan sprang from a single mind, and that the mind of <lb/>
            Ictinus. The chief glory of the interior was the statue of Athene itself, <lb/>
            wrought by Pheidias in gold and ivory; gold being employed for the <lb/>
            dress and the armour, and ivory for so much of the person as was left <lb/>
            uncovered. <note type="footnote"> ascribing the victories over the Persians to Athene, and suggesting that the Gods <lb/>
            brought to her as the prize of victory a branch from the sacred olive-tree in the <lb/>

          <p>In the course of certain excavations made in the Acropolis during <lb/>
            the years 1835 and 1836, the foundations of some older buildings on the <lb/>
            site of the Parthenon were incidentally brought to light. These older <lb/>
            buildings do not seem to have been of the same character as, or to have <lb/>
            corresponded in any way with, the building erected by Ictinus, but <lb/>
            antiquaries at once jumped to the conclusion that they represented an <lb/>
            earlier Parthenon which had been destroyed by the Persians. That <lb/>
            conclusion seems to me quite untenable. The Acropolis was the origi­ <lb/>
            nal “Athens,” and must have been completely covered with public <lb/>
            and private buildings from Royal Palaces down to the humblest <lb/>
            abodes. And this state of things continued until the Persians practically <lb/>
            cleared the plateau (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐνέπρησαν πᾶσαν τὴν ἀκρόπολιν</foreign> is the language, <lb/>
            already quoted, of Herodotus), and gave the Athenians an opportunity <lb/>
            of transforming the crowded fortress into a noble storehouse of Art and <lb/>
            Religion. When the Parthenon was erected by Ictinns, it could only be <lb/>
            erected on the site of earlier buildings. And it is extremely improbable <lb/>
            that whilst the Acropolis continued to be the most thickly populated <lb/>
            region of Athens there should have been space for, or need of, a second <lb/>
            great Temple of Athene. It was only in "the spacious times" of <lb/>
            Pericles, after the plateau of the Acropolis had been given him as a blank <lb/>
            slate on which to inscribe whatever he would, that Temples and other <lb/>
            great works were designed, not for any merely utilitarian purpose, but <lb/>
            with the object of enhancing the splendour of Athens as the Mistress of <lb/>
            a Mighty Empire. And this is in accordance with all the indications to <lb/>
            be found in ancient literature. It is plain that Herodotus knew of but <lb/>
            one Temple in the Acropolis; <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸ ἱρὸν συλήσαντες ἐνέπρσαν τὴν ἀκρόπολιν</foreign> <lb/>
            he says in a passage quoted above. And although the Homeric story about <lb/>
            Athene retiring to the <foreign xml:lang="grc">δόμον</foreign> ’<foreign xml:lang="grc">Ερεχθῆος</foreign> does not necessarily exclude the <lb/>
            existence of other Temples in the Acropolis, yet the poet would hardly <lb/>
            have described her as having her home in a Temple of which she was <lb/>
            merely a part-owner, had he been aware that she possessed in the same <lb/>
            little enclosure another Temple entirely dedicated to herself. The origi­ <lb/>
            nator of the theory of a " pre-Persian " Parthenon appears to have been <lb/>
             <pb n="XXXI"/>
            Professor Ludwig Ross, who thought that he found confirmation of it in <lb/>
            the explanation which Hesychius gives of the word <foreign xml:lang="grc">Ἑκατόμπεδος</foreign>, namely <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BELL_07_fig16.jpg"/></figure><lb/>
              . But <lb/>
              by “the Temple burnt by the Persians " he means the Temple famous in <lb/>
              history as having been burnt by the Persians, that is to say the earlier <lb/>
              Erechtheium; he is not alluding to any unknown Parthenon. Leake <lb/>
              (Topography of Athens i. 556) observes that "if we apply the remark of <lb/>
              Hesychius to the Erechtheium it is manifestly erroneous, no dimension <lb/>
              of the Erechtheium being fifty feet." It would not be surprising if the <lb/>
              measurement given by Hesychius is really erroneous ; but Leake forgets <lb/>
              that while he himself is speaking of the existing Erechtheium, Hesychius <lb/>
              is speaking of the earlier Erechtheium which was burnt by the Persians. <lb/>
              And Mr. Fergusson, it will be remembered, considers that the Erech­ <lb/>
              theium originally extended for some distance to the west of the existing <lb/>
              ruins. But without going further into these questions we may rest <lb/>
              assured that the Doric Temple so well known to all of us was the first <lb/>
              and only Parthenon ever erected on the Acropolis of Athens.</p>
          <p>The statue of the Polias was of olive-wood: the statue of the <lb/>
            Parthenos was of ivory and gold: the Promachus was a colossal image of <lb/>
            bronze, standing in full armour with a spear erect in its <lb/>
            hand. Its height is, I believe, nowhere mentioned, but <lb/>
            it was so gigantic that the crest of the helmet and the <lb/>
            THE <lb/>
            PROMACHUS. <lb/>
            tip of the spear overtopped everything on the Acropolis, and were visible <lb/>
            to the approaching mariner soon after he had rounded the promontory of <lb/>
            Sunium1; just as in England the top of a cathedral spire may be <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Ταύτης τῆς</foreign> ’<foreign xml:lang="grc">Αθηνᾶς ἡ</foreign> TOp <foreign xml:lang="grc">δόρατος αἰχμὴ καὶ</foreign> 6 <foreign xml:lang="grc">λόφος τοῦ κράνους απὸ Σουνίου <lb/>
            προσπλέουσίν ἐστιν ἤδη σύνοπτα</foreign>.—Pausanias i. 28. 2. The meaning of the passage, <lb/>
            which seems perfectly clear, is strangely misunderstood by Col. Leake (Topography <lb/>
            of Athens i. 350 and 631). He thinks that Pausanias is referring to a spot <lb/>
            whence the Acropolis itself and its buildings could be plainly seen, and is calling <lb/>
            attention to the circumstance that, even so, nothing was visible of the Promachus <lb/>
            excepting the crest and the spear-point. To account for this circumstance <lb/>
            Col. Leake suggests that the rest of the statue must have been hidden by the </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="XXXII"/>
            a conspicuous object at the distance of very many miles, although the city <lb/>
            itself from the midst of which it arises may be quite invisible except in <lb/>
            its immediate vicinity. The statue itself was, Pausanias tells us, the work <lb/>
            of Pheidias 1, who made another for the Plataeans, of different material <lb/>
            but of almost equal dimensions. The date at which the statue was <lb/>
            erected on the Acropolis is unknown, but it must have been, one would <lb/>
            suppose, in the days of Cimon or Pericles. The Scholiast on Demos­ <lb/>
            thenes, cited in the note on page xx supra, seems to imply that it was <lb/>
            done before the battle of Salamis; but in that case it could not have <lb/>
            been the work of Pheidias, nor could it by any possibility have survived <lb/>
            the Persian occupation of Athens. And the statement of Demosthenes <lb/>
            himself2 that the Athenians dedicated the great bronze statue as an <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀριστεῖον τοῦ πρὸς τοὺς βαρβάρους πολέμου</foreign> rather points, and I think <lb/>
            rightly, to the period when <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἁ πρὸς τοὺς βαράρους πόλεμος</foreign> had been <lb/>
            substantially concluded. But the language of an orator must not be <note type="footnote"> Parthenon; and he actually from these utterly erroneous data attempts to fix <lb/>
            the exact situation and height of the Promachus. And as the Acropolis, he tells <lb/>
            us, first comes into sight to the west of Cape Zoster, he takes Pausanias to mean <lb/>
            that the crest and the spear-point become visible to the mariner only after he has <lb/>
            coasted along more than half the distance from Cape Sunium to Peiraeus. <lb/>
            The language will not admit of this interpretation. Pausanias means that the <lb/>
            crest and the spear-point-and no other part of the Acropolis or its buildings- <lb/>
            became visible to mariners shortly after they have passed Cape Sunium. If not <lb/>
            speaking from his own knowledge, he may have been misled by false information. <lb/>
            Or it may be, as Dodwell (Tour i. 541) suggests, that these lofty tips may have <lb/>
            been visible to sailors very soon after passing Sunium, if they were not keeping <lb/>
            to the coast, but standing some miles out at sea. </note> <figure type="illustration">

              taken too literally, and there is no doubt that the great statue had <lb/>
              special reference to the primal victory which Athene gave to her people <lb/>
              on " the pleasant mead of Marathon." The very appellation <foreign xml:lang="grc">Πρόμαχς</foreign> <lb/>
              was probably selected as a reminiscence of that memorable September <lb/>
              evening when</p><figure type="illustration">

          <p>The attitude and general appearance of the martial figure, as it stood <lb/>
            facing the Propylaea from its central position on the Acropolis, are <lb/>
            clearly shown in coins delineated on the first plate in Leake's Topo­ <lb/>
            graphy of Athens. And more than eight centuries afterwards the vision <lb/>
            of Athene Promachus patrolling the walls of Athens is said to have <lb/>
            struck such fear into the fearless heart of Alaric that it deterred him <lb/>

          <p>The reader must not forget that there were innumerable other works <lb/>
            of religious art, shrines, and statues (some of Athene herself) on the <lb/>
            Acropolis which, as unnecessary for our present purpose, <lb/>
            are unnoticed in the Plan. But he will find there, between <lb/>

            of the Brauronia, mentioned in line 645 of the present Comedy, was <lb/>
            celebrated in the seaside town of Brauron (Hdt. vi. 138, Peace 874, 876), <lb/>
            and it was there, I imagine, that some specially selected Athenian <lb/>

          <p>It may perhaps be permissible to add, though the fact has no rele­ <lb/>
            vancy to the present Comedy, that almost adjacent, apparently, to the <lb/>
            Temple of Artemis Brauronia stood a bronze representation of the <lb/>
            Wooden Horse within which the Achaean leaders were taken into the city <lb/>
            of Troy. In this great bronze horse Menestheus, Teucer, and two sons <lb/>
            of Theseus were shown peeping out from the inside (Pausanias i. 23. 10). <lb/>
            The Scholiast on Birds 1128 supposes that Aristophanes may there be <lb/>
            referring to this great bronze horse; a suggestion which seems to me <lb/>
            quite inadmissible.</p>
          <p>Before leaving the Acropolis, it is necessary to revert to a subject <lb/>
            already mentioned, viz. the locality of the National Treasury of Athens. <lb/>
            THE <lb/>
            NATIONAL <lb/>
            TREASURY. <lb/>
            AVe know that it was " beside Athene" <foreign xml:lang="grc">παρὰ. τᾷ σιῷιῷ</foreign>, as <lb/>
            Lampito here (line 174) expresses it; and again, that it <lb/>
            was the inner chamber of her Temple" <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὁ ὀπισθόδομος τῆς <lb/>
            θεοῦ</foreign>, as Chremylus tells us in Plutus 1193. But which Temple? that of <lb/>
            the <foreign xml:lang="grc">Πολιὰς</foreign> or that of the <foreign xml:lang="grc">Παρθένος</foreign> ? All a priori ideas would be in <lb/>
            favour of the former, which possessed a traditional sanctity to which the <lb/>
            Parthenon could never lay claim. And the only ancient authority on <lb/>
            the subject, the Scholiast on the Plutus, expressly says that the treasure <lb/>
            was kept in the inner chamber of the Temple of the <foreign xml:lang="grc">Πολιάς</foreign>. But <lb/>
            modern antiquaries, examining the remains of the two Temples, declare <lb/>
            that there is no such inner chamber to be found in the Erechtheium, as <lb/>
            there is in the Parthenon. And overborne by their authority I have <lb/>
            reluctantly in the Commentary on the Plutus, as well as in the present <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Οπίσω τοῦ νεὼ τῆς καλουμένης Πολιάδος 'Αθηνᾶς διπλοῦς τοῖχος ἔχων</foreign> Bvpav <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἄπου ἦν <lb/>

            Play, adopted their conclusion that the National Treasure was kept in <lb/>
            the Parthenon. But I am " a man convinced against my will" ; and I <lb/>
            should like to know whether the experts may not have failed to find an <lb/>
            inner chamber in the Erechtheium, from the supposed necessity (which <lb/>
            in my judgement does not exist) of finding a third chamber for the ex­ <lb/>
            clusive use of Pandrosus. It must be remembered that, when the <lb/>
            Treasury of the Allies was transferred from Delos to Athens, the <lb/>
            Parthenon was not in existence. It is said that a recently discovered <lb/>
            papyrus shows that the transfer was made in the archonship of Euthy­ <lb/>
            demus, 450-449 B. c., and that the Parthenon was not even commenced <lb/>
            until the archonship of Timarchides) three years later (Classical Review, <lb/>
            xviii, p. 92). Where then was the treasure lodged until the Parthenon <lb/>
            was completed ? And there could have been no treasure in the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὀπισθό­ <lb/>
            δομος</foreign> of the Parthenon when the Athenians made it a guestchamber for <lb/>
            Demetrius Poliorcetes (Plutarch, Demetrius 23). It seems to me that <lb/>
            everything points to the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὀπισθόδομος</foreign> of the Erechtheium, and not the <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὀπισθόδομος</foreign> of the Parthenon, as having been the National Treasury; <lb/>
            and that it is the plain duty of archaeologists to find a place for it in the <lb/>
            ruins of the older Temple. Notwithstanding what is said in the earlier <lb/>
            part of this Introduction, it would not altogether surprise me if Compart­ <lb/>
            ment B were discovered to be the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὀπισθόδομος</foreign> of the Erechtheium, and <lb/>
            the seat of the National Treasury. The Treasury was in the charge of <lb/>
            ten <foreign xml:lang="grc">ταμίαι</foreign>, chosen by lot, one from each tribe 1.</p>
          <p>The sides of the Acropolis-rock were everywhere steep and precipitous ex­ <lb/>
            cept at the western end, where a sloping road, no doubt partly natural and <lb/>
            partly artificial, led up to the plateau at the summit. The <lb/>
            slope was about 168 feet wide and was sufficiently easy <lb/>
            for the ascent of carriages. At or about the time when <lb/>
            THE <lb/>
            PROPYLAEA. <lb/>
            Ictinus was completing the splendid pile of the Parthenon, another great <note type="footnote"> 1 Aristotle's Polity of Athens, chap. 47. </note> <figure type="illustration">

              Athenian architect, Mnesicles by name, was engaged in erecting above <lb/>
              this slope a portal of no less majesty and grace than the work of Ictinus ; <lb/>
              so that, in truth, the Parthenon and the Propylaea were recognized as <lb/>
              two of the chief architectural glories of ancient Athens. The actual <lb/>
              gates were five in number; the central gate being the largest, both in <lb/>
              height and width ; that on each side of it being smaller; and that at <lb/>
              each end smaller still. But the gates themselves formed but a subordi­ <lb/>
              nate part of the entire fabric of the Propylaea, which was a building <lb/>
              168 feet long, divisible into three sections, a large wing on each side, <lb/>
              and between them, a little thrown back, the central or gateway section <lb/>
              about 58 feet long and 72 feet deep. As you approached the Acropolis <lb/>
              you saw before you a colonnade of six Doric columns, the central gap <lb/>
              between the third and fourth columns leading to the central gate. Pass­ <lb/>
              ing through this gap you saw before you at a distance of about 43 feet <lb/>
              the central gate, while on each side of you arose three Ionic columns, <lb/>
              dividing the space between the Doric columns and the gates into what <lb/>
              have been called three aisles, the middle aisle leading only to the central <lb/>
              gate, and each of the side aisles leading to the two side gates. When <lb/>
              you had passed the gates you still had some 21 feet to traverse before you <lb/>
              emerged through another and precisely similar Doric colonnade into the <lb/>
              interior of the Acropolis. The entire building, wings and all, was of <lb/>
              white marble: and, in particular, the enormous blocks, over 22 feet in <lb/>
              length, which formed the roof or ceiling supported by the columns, have <lb/>
              attracted the admiration of both ancient and modern observers. The work <lb/>
              was commenced in the archonship of Euthymenes, 437-436 B. c., and took <lb/>
              five years to exccute 1. It was therefore only just completed at the out­ <lb/>
              break of the Peloponnesian War.</p>
          <p>One, coming from the Lower City to the foot of the slope leading up <figure type="illustration">

              to the Propylaea, would see on his right three Temples, all recognized in <lb/>
              the present Play. High up, on a sort of bastion of the <lb/>
              Cimonian Wall, stood a little Temple of white marble, <lb/>
              dedicated to '<foreign xml:lang="grc">Αθάνα Νίκη</foreign> otherwise the Wingless Vic- <lb/>
              THREE TEMPLES : <lb/>
              (I) <lb/>
              OF VICTORY ; <lb/>
              tory1. So all-pervading, to the Athenian mind, was the divine influence of <lb/>
              the National Goddess, that her name was frequently prefixed to what was <lb/>
              really an abstract idea, to show that that also was divine. If the reader <lb/>
              will look at the Plan he will see between the Propylaea and the Temple <lb/>
              of Artemis Brauronia the shrine of Athene '<foreign xml:lang="grc">Υγίεια</foreign> (Pausanias i. 23. 5). <lb/>
              And elsewhere we hear of Athene <foreign xml:lang="grc">Πρόνοια</foreign>, Athene <foreign xml:lang="grc">Πειθὼ</foreign>, and even <lb/>
              Athene <foreign xml:lang="grc">Σάλπιγξ</foreign>. Not that Athene herself was " Victory," or " Healthy <lb/>
              or "Forethought" or "Persuasion," or a "War-trumpet"; but all <lb/>
              these things were attributes or appurtenances of the Goddess. And so <lb/>
              the name Athene <foreign xml:lang="grc">Νίκη</foreign>, as regards Athene, differed little from Athene <lb/>
              <foreign xml:lang="grc">νικηφόρος</foreign>, though as regards <foreign xml:lang="grc">Νίκη</foreign>, it elevated a mere abstraction into <lb/>
              a personal divinity. The architect of the Temple was Callicrates 2, of <lb/>
              whom we have already heard as a claimant for the honour of having <lb/>
              assisted Ictinus in the erection of the Parthenon. The Temple of Victory <lb/>
              was erected on a spot from which the sea was plainly visible, a spot <lb/>
              memorable in historic legend as that from which Aegeus watched the <lb/>
              ship of his son Theseus crossing the Saronic gulf on its return from the <lb/>
              encounter with the Cretan Minotaur, and whence he threw himself in <lb/>
              despair when he saw black sails displayed on its masts instead of the white <lb/>
              ones which Theseus had promised, (but had forgotten,) to hoist if he <lb/>
              returned safe and victorious over his enemy. There was to be no mistake <lb/>
              about the Victory now. The little white Temple was a conspicuous <lb/>
              object from many quarters. It was erected several years before the <figure type="illustration">

              commencement of the Propylaea, and seems to have rendered necessary <lb/>
              a modification of the latter building. For the southern wing of the <lb/>
              Propylaea is, apparently, thrown back in order that it may not interfere <lb/>
              with this little Temple of Victory. The Temple was still entire when <lb/>
              Sir George Wheler visited Athens in the year 1676, and was then used <lb/>
              by the Turks as a powder-magazine 1. But the Turks afterwards pulled <lb/>
              it down, and worked the materials into a military battery. However <lb/>
              during the last century its remains were disinterred from the battery, <lb/>
              and the Temple has since been re-erected 2. Of the two other Temples <lb/>

              ascertained. They are the last two objects noticed <lb/>
              by Pausanias in his walk from the Dionysiac Theatre <lb/>
              to the Propylaea 3. He mentions five in all; (1) the <lb/>
              tomb of Calos (otherwise Talos) who was flung by <lb/>
              Daedalus from the top of the Acropolis, and was <lb/>
              doubtless buried where he fell, at the foot of the rock; (2) the Temple of <lb/>
              Asclepius in which Pausanias tells us there was a spring of water, and <lb/>
              which is sufficiently identified by a disused well "about fourteen paces <lb/>
              from the western wall of the theatre, and fifty from the rock"; see <lb/>
              Dyer's Ancient Athens, pp. 344-6, and especially the passage cited from <lb/>
              the life of Proclus; (3) a shrine of Themis with a tumulus in memory of <lb/>
              Hippolytus before it. And then come the two Temples with which we <lb/>
              are concerned, viz. (4) the Temple of Aphrodite Pandemus and Peitho. <lb/>
              The worship of these two deities was established by Theseus, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπεὶ <lb/>
              'Αθηναίους ἐς μίαν ἤγαγεν ἀπὸ πῶν δήμων πόλιν</foreign>, Aphrodite Pandemus signi­ <lb/>
              fying the love which had united all the demes into one city, and Peitho <lb/>
              the persuasion by which that union was effected; the original images <lb/>
              of these divinities had ceased to exist before the time of Pausanias, but <lb/>
              others by no mean artists had been substituted in their stead. And (5) <lb/>
              the Temple of <foreign xml:lang="grc">Γῆ κουροτρόφος</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">Δημήτηρ Χλόη</foreign> which, there seems no <note type="footnote"> 1 Wheler's Journey, p. 358. </note><note type="footnote">2 Dyer's Ancient Athens, pp. 372, 373. </note><note type="footnote">3 Pausanias i. 21. 6 to 22. 3. </note> <lb/>
               <pb n="XXXIX"/>
              sufficient reason for doubting, is the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἱερὸν τῆς Γῆς</foreign> described by Thucy­ <lb/>
              dides as being in the neighbourhood of the Acropolis, on the southerly <lb/>
              side. From the place which it occupies in the narrative of Pausanias, <lb/>
              as well as from the requirements of the scene in the Lysistrata, it seems <lb/>
              to me that it must have been just at the foot of the " flat slope " leading <lb/>
              to the Propylaea. Colonel Leake, who places it in the wall upon which <lb/>
              the Temple of Victory stood, seems to have misconceived the route which <lb/>
              Pausanias followed in his walk from the Theatre to the Propylaea.</p>
          <p>The three Temples we have been considering in the preceding para­ <lb/>
            graph are all on the south or south-west of the Propylaea; the brackish <lb/>
            intermittent spring known as the Clepsydra, and the <lb/>
            adjacent grotto assigned to Pan—as an acknowledgement <lb/>
            of the services which he rendered to the Athenians in con­ <lb/>
            nexion with the battle of Marathon—were also in close <lb/>
            THE <lb/>
            CLEPSYDRA <lb/>
            AND <lb/>
            PAN'S <lb/>
            GROTTO. <lb/>
            proximity to the Propylaea, but on the other side; the spring issuing <lb/>
            from, and the grotto hollowed in, the northern side of the rock which <lb/>
            formed the Acropolis. These were natural objects, and are perhaps <lb/>
            sufficiently described in the Commentary on this Play. The great water <lb/>
            supply called Enneacrounos is not mentioned by name in the Comedy, <lb/>
            but is, I doubt not, the unnamed <foreign xml:lang="grc">ρήνη</foreign> at which the Chorus of Women <lb/>
            had been filling their pitchers (line 328). Originally a mere spring, called <lb/>
            from its bright and sparkling water Callirrhoe, it was <lb/>
            enclosed by Peisistratus, and made a vast reservoir into <lb/>
            ENNEACROUNOS. <lb/>
            which water was brought by pipes from many other quarters. To this <lb/>
            reservoir was given the name Enneacrounos. Its locality is a matter of <lb/>
            discussion into which I hope that I may be excused from entering. <lb/>
            Suffice it to say that while there are many strong arguments for placing <lb/>
            it near the Temple of Olympian Zeus by the side of the River Ilissus, <lb/>
            there are also many strong, and on the whole I think stronger, argu­ <lb/>
            ments for placing it in the valley between the Acropolis and the <lb/>
            Areopagus, in the direction indicated on the Plan.</p>
          <p>The only objects remaining to be mentioned in this connexion are the <lb/>
            statues of Harmodius and Aristogeiton. There were statues of Harmo­ <lb/>
             <pb n="XL"/>
            dius and Aristogeiton originally erected soon after the expulsion of the <lb/>
            Peisistratidae in 510 B. C ; but the original statues were appropriated by <lb/>
            Xerxes during his occupation of Athens about thirty years later, and were <lb/>
            by him carried away to Susa, a tribute certainly to their attractive <lb/>
            character. However almost the first thing the Athenians did when the <lb/>
            cloud of the Persian invasion was dispersed was to erect new statues of <lb/>
            the tyrannicides, probably duplicates of the originals. It appears by the <lb/>
            Marmor Oxoniense (line 70) that these new statues were ordered in the <lb/>
            year 477; and the statues standing in the time of Aristophanes were of <lb/>
            course these duplicates. But a century later Alexander the Great, taking <lb/>
            possession of Susa, found the original statues there, and with singular <lb/>
            generosity ordered them to be restored to Athens, an order carried into <lb/>
            effect after his death. " And there they still stand," says Arrian (Expe­ <lb/>
            ditio Alexandri iii. 16), "in the Cerameicus, just where we ascend to the <lb/>
            Acropolis," <foreign xml:lang="grc">ᾗ ἄνιμεν ὲς πόλιν</foreign> ; that is, near the foot of the slope which <lb/>
            leads to the Propylaea. Arrian is speaking of the recovered originals, <lb/>
            but we may be sure that they were restored to their original situation, <lb/>
            whether they displaced the later memorial or stood by its side; Pau­ <lb/>
            sanias i. 8. 5. That this was the situation in which the substituted <lb/>
            statues were standing in the time of Aristophanes may be inferred with <lb/>
            some confidence from lines 632-4 of the present Comedy.</p>
          <p>I must repeat what I said at the commencement of this topographical <lb/>
            sketch, that it is intended merely for the use of unlearned readers who may, <lb/>
            I hope, find even this very superficial account of the localities, amidst <lb/>
            which the action of the Lysistrata is supposed to be carried on, of some <lb/>
            little assistance in enabling them to appreciate the progress of the plot.</p>
          <p>At the commencement of the Play, Lysistrata, a young and beautiful <lb/>
            Athénienne, is discovered standing alone in front of the Propylaea. She <lb/>
            has summoned an assembly of young married women, not only from <lb/>
            Athens itself, but also from the hostile states composing the Pelopon­ <lb/>
            nesian Confederacy, to meet her at this spot, for the purpose of discussing <lb/>
            an important project the nature of which she has not at present disclosed. <lb/>
             <pb n="XLI"/>
            And after some delay they come flocking in, the Athenians first, and <lb/>
            then the Spartan Lampito with deputies from Boeotia and Corinth, <lb/>
            both at war with, and the bitterest enemies of, the Athenians. For the <lb/>
            old Attic Comedy paid no heed to impossibilities; the audience would <lb/>
            not inquire how Lysistrata could have sent her summons through hostile <lb/>
            lands, or how the women so summoned could have made their way past <lb/>
            walls and sentries into the very heart of Athens. It was enough that <lb/>
            here they were, eager to know why Lysistrata had summoned them. So <lb/>
            now she reveals her scheme, proposing that they shall all refuse to <lb/>
            consort with their husbands until the latter make peace, and put a final <lb/>
            end to this fratricidal war. At first some of the women are inclined to <lb/>
            demur; but Lampito ranges herself on the side of Lysistrata—as indeed <lb/>
            there was always a secret sympathy between Sparta and Athens-and <lb/>
            presently all the others are persuaded to concur. Lampito herself how­ <lb/>
            ever expresses a doubt whether the Athenian democracy will make and <lb/>
            maintain peace in real earnest, whilst there is so much money (the <lb/>
            thousand talents just set free for the purposes of the war) stored up in <lb/>
            Athene's Temple, that is, in the National Treasury, supra, p. xxxiv; but <lb/>
            Lysistrata assures her that they have taken thought for that; and that <lb/>
            while the younger women are discussing matters in this Assembly, the <lb/>
            older women have been told off to seize the Acropolis where the money <lb/>
            is kept. These elder women, or twelve of them, afterwards form the <lb/>
            Chorus, or Semichorus, of women.</p>
          <p>It is perhaps natural that Commentators should have taken less trouble <lb/>
            about the Lysistrata than about the more widely read Comedies of <lb/>
            Aristophanes. Yet it seems almost incredible that they should as a rule <lb/>
            have overlooked the broad distinction, which pervades the Play, between <lb/>
            the old women in the orchestra and the young women on the stage. <lb/>
            Indeed the latest editor, Professor Van Leeuwen, in his search after <lb/>
            novelties, dignifies with the titles <foreign xml:lang="grc">Γραῦς</foreign> A, <foreign xml:lang="grc">Γραῦς</foreign> B, <foreign xml:lang="grc">Γραῦς Γ</foreign> (First, Second, <lb/>
            and Third Hags) Lysistrata's comrades whose youth and beauty are the <lb/>
            very qualities relied upon for bringing about a termination of the War. <lb/>
            Nor does Lysistrata herself fare much better. Notwithstanding the <lb/>
             <pb n="XLII"/>
            encomiums passed upon her personal attractiveness, notwithstanding the <lb/>
            fact that Calonice, herself a young woman, addresses her as "child," <lb/>
            almost all recent editors depart from the MSS., depart from the <lb/>
            Scholiast, depart from common sense, for the sole purpose of styling her <lb/>
            "most mannish of GRANDMOTHERS."</p>
          <p>This however is a digression. Lysistrata's assurances satisfy Lampito ; <lb/>
            and the whole assembly-and of course there are very many present <lb/>
            besides the few speakers-enter into a solemn League and covenant to <lb/>
            carry out Lysistrata's scheme. The oath which they take is prefaced by <lb/>
            an appeal to <foreign xml:lang="grc">δέσποινα Πειθὼ</foreign>, the Goddess of Persuasion, whose temple, <lb/>
            or rather the Temple which she shared with Aphrodite Pandemus (supra, <lb/>
            p. xxxviii), was probably full in view. Meanwhile a distant shout advertises <lb/>
            them of the capture of the Acropolis; the Assembly breaks up; Lampito <lb/>
            departs for Sparta to commence a similar agitation there; and the others <lb/>
            retire through the Propylaea, leaving the stage empty.</p>
          <p>Now then is the time for the Chorus to enter into the Orchestra. In <lb/>
            Comedy the Chorus consists of twenty-four persons; and as a rule they <lb/>
            -all enter together, singing their Parodos or entrance-song. But-both in <lb/>
            this Play and inthe Ecclesiazusae they enter in two separate divisions <lb/>
            or Semichoruses. each consisting of twelve persons. In the Ecclesiazusae <lb/>
            one Semichorus represnets the Women of the City, the other the Women <lb/>
            of the Country.Here one Semichorus consists of twelve old men, the <lb/>
            other of twelve old women. In both Plays he- two Semichoruses <lb/>
            ultimatelycoalesce, and rorm one ordinary Chorus of wenty-four persons. <lb/>
            Here the Chorus of Men (if it is permissible to apply that name to <lb/>
            a Semichorus) enter first, with slow and laborious steps, carrying large logs <lb/>
            of wood and pots containing fire. They are vowing vengeance against <lb/>
            these detestable women who have had the audacity to seize the Acropolis <lb/>
            and possess themselves of the Holy Image, meaning the olive-wood <lb/>
            statue in the Erechtheium; see supra, p. xxiii. And they threaten to set <lb/>
            fire to the gates of the Propylaea, which therefore must have been made <lb/>
            of wood, and to burn all the women in one common conflagration. And <lb/>
            finally they pray <foreign xml:lang="grc">δέσποινα Νίκη</foreign>, whose Temple was straight before them <lb/>
             <pb n="XLIII"/>
            (supra, p. xxxvii), to give them the victory over these female desperadoes. <lb/>
            They obviously think that the Women will await the attack, cowering <lb/>
            behind the Propylaea. But in this they speedily find themselves mis­ <lb/>
            taken. Whilst they are busying themselves with their preparations for <lb/>
            the assault other voices are heard in the distance, singing another and <lb/>
            a far livelier entrance-song, and presently the Chorus of Women come <lb/>
            pouring down into the orchestra, so that the two Choruses meet face to <lb/>
            face. The women have been filling their pitchers at the Enneacrounos <lb/>
            (supra, p. xxxix), and having heard that the Men are bringing fire against <lb/>
            the Acropolis they come with their water to quench it. They have <lb/>
            seized Athene's dwelling-place-so they call the Acropolis-for the <lb/>
            purpose of saving Hellas from War and Madness, and they pray the <lb/>
            Goddess, in her triple character of <foreign xml:lang="grc">Πολιὰς, Παρθένος</foreign>, and <foreign xml:lang="grc">Πρόμαχος</foreign>, to <lb/>
            aid them in their design. The leader of the Men is the Coryphaeus of <lb/>
            the full Chorus, the leader of the Women is an ancient dame bearing the <lb/>
            name of Stratyllis. An altercation at once ensues between the two <lb/>
            Choruses, which ends by the Men endeavouring to set fire to the hair of <lb/>
            the Women, and the Women, in reply, deluging their opponents with <lb/>
            water from their pitchers. The tumult is at its height when it is <lb/>
            suddenly arrested by the entrance of a great officer of state, attended by <lb/>
            four Scythian archers. This important personage is one of the Ten <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">Πρόβουλοι</foreign> whose position and duties have been considered in the earlier <lb/>
            part of this Introduction. It is not probable that Aristophanes is <lb/>
            intending to caricature any particular member of the Board; a <foreign xml:lang="grc">Πρόβου­ <lb/>
            λος</foreign> is introduced here, just as a <foreign xml:lang="grc">Πρύτανις</foreign> is introduced in the Thesmo­ <lb/>
            phoriazusae, merely because the presence of some high executive official <lb/>
            is necessary for the proper development of the plot. It is in the <lb/>
            execution of the special duty for which the <foreign xml:lang="grc">Πρόβουλοι</foreign> were appointed <lb/>
            that he is making his way to the National Treasury in the Acropolis, to <lb/>
            draw thence the funds required for the rebuilding of the fleet. But <lb/>
            this is the very thing which the Women are determined shall not be <lb/>
            done; and a long debate ensues between Lysistrata and the Magistrate, <lb/>
            in which the latter gets thoroughly worsted. In the course of this <lb/>
             <pb n="XLIV"/>
            debate Lysistrata takes occasion to develop her views-that is, the views <lb/>
            of Aristophanes—as to the reforms required in the internal politics of <lb/>
            Athens. And it is worthy of note that, as in the other Comedies so <lb/>
            here, there is not the slightest trace of political partisanship; the reforms <lb/>
            suggested are such as would commend themselves to every loyal citizen, <lb/>
            viz. the removal of abuses, the suppression of party caucuses, the <lb/>
            blending together of all classes in harmony and goodwill. The debate is <lb/>
            full of interest, but it does not concern our present purpose which is merely <lb/>
            to elucidate the various topographical allusions contained in the Comedy.</p>
          <p>The debate between Lysistrata and the Magistrate having come to an <lb/>
            end, both parties retire from the stage; Lysistrata arid her friends <lb/>
            passing through the Propylaea into the Acropolis, and the <foreign xml:lang="grc">Πρόβουλος</foreign> <lb/>
            going off to complain to his fellow <foreign xml:lang="grc">Πρόβουλοι</foreign> of the outrageous behaviour <lb/>
            of the Women. The stage therefore is again empty, and the rival <lb/>
            Choruses in the Orchestra resume their interrupted altercation. Four <lb/>
            speeches are made, all in a pleasant mixture of cretico-paeonics and tro­ <lb/>
            chaics, and each ending in a scuffle between the Men and the Women. <lb/>
            The first and third speeches are delivered by the Men, the second and <lb/>
            fourth by the Women ; the reply of the Women being in each case <lb/>
            antistrophical to the preceding speech of the Men. The latter begin by <lb/>
            an elaborate indictment, in which they incidentally show that they <lb/>
            belong (as indeed almost all old Athenians of the poorer classes did) to <lb/>
            the dicastie order, not merely by complaining that the seizure of the <lb/>
            National Treasury by the Women has stopped their <foreign xml:lang="grc">μισθὸν</foreign>, meaning the <lb/>
            daily dicastic three obols, but also by denouncing their opponents as <lb/>
            CONSPIRATORS seeking to establish a TYRANNY, those words so dear <lb/>
            to the dicastic ear. But if the Women become Tyrants, they, the <lb/>
            old Men, will become Tyrannicides. They will wrap their swords in <lb/>
            myrtle, and take their stand-thus, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὦδε</foreign>—beside Aristogeiton (supra, <lb/>
            p. xl), and deliver a blow, as he upon Hipparchus, so they upon the <lb/>
            cheeks of the old Women, suiting the action to the word. The speaker <lb/>
            is the Coryphaeus, and the woman threatened is Stratyllis; but doubt­ <lb/>
            less, as he strikes her, each of the other eleven old Men delivers a similar <lb/>
             <pb n="XLV"/>
            blow upon the cheek of one of the other eleven old Women. For the <lb/>
            whole Chorus speak by the mouth of their Coryphaeus, and act as he <lb/>
            acts. When Stratyllis deluges the Coryphaeus with water (line 381), we <lb/>
            must understand that the other women of the Chorus are performing the <lb/>
            same operation upon the other men. When the Coryphaeus raises his <lb/>
            foot to kick Stratyllis (line 799), we must understand that the other men <lb/>
            are raising theirs to do the like to the other women. When Stratyllis is <lb/>
            extracting the gnat from the eye of the Coryphaeus (line 1030), we must <lb/>
            picture the other women performing the same kind office for the other <lb/>
            men. This is a principle we must always bear in mind; and it seems to <lb/>
            me that Van Leeuwen's innovation of prefixing the name <foreign xml:lang="grc">Κορυφαῖος</foreign> to the <lb/>
            lines which the learned Professor supposes him to speak, so dissociating <lb/>
            him, as it were, from his Chorus, and making him almost an independent <lb/>
            actor, is disastrous to the right understanding of Greek Comedy.</p>
          <p>We cannot of course tell whether the objects to which the various <lb/>
            speakers allude, such as the statue of Aristogeiton, were actually repre­ <lb/>
            sented in the scenery of the stage. Nor is it material; for they were all <lb/>
            so extremely familiar to an Athenian audience that every spectator would <lb/>
            readily supply them out of his own imagination.</p>
          <p>After the conclusion of these four speeches an interval of five days is <lb/>
            supposed to elapse. And when we are again admitted to see what is <lb/>
            going on, we find that the separation of the sexes has become intolerable <lb/>
            to both of them. The Men are preparing to give in and make peace, <lb/>
            and Lysistrata's scheme is on the point of succeeding, if only she can <lb/>
            keep the Women from giving in first. But this is a very difficult task. <lb/>
            We find them, indeed we see them, endeavouring to escape from the <lb/>
            Acropolis by every loophole, and under the most ridiculous pretences. <lb/>
            But in this place it is only necessary to mention one, whom Lysistrata <lb/>
            found, she tells us, clearing out a little aperture in the wall with intent <lb/>
            to descend by Pan's grotto (supra, p. xxxix). The issue of her attempt is <lb/>
            not recorded, but I apprehend that it had little chance of success after <lb/>
            Lysistrata's glance had fallen upon her. And, finally, all the women are, <lb/>
            by their leaders energy and resource, brought back to their duty, and <lb/>
             <pb n="XLVI"/>
            agree to await the overtures of their antagonists, which indeed are not <lb/>
            long in arriving. Almost immediately Lysistrata, standing on the wall, <lb/>
            espies a man hastening towards them <foreign xml:lang="grc">παρὰ τὸ τῆς Χλόης</foreign>, by the Temple of <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">Γῆ κουροτρόφος</foreign> and Demeter Chloe (supra, p. xxxviii). He turns out to be <lb/>
            the husband of Myrrhina who has a prolonged and tantalizing interview <lb/>
            with him, in the course of which both Pan's grotto and the Clepsydra <lb/>
            (supra, p. xxxix) are mentioned, and finally eludes his fondest hopes by <lb/>
            suddenly disappearing through the gates of the Propylaea. But the end <lb/>
            is now full in view. Lampito has persuaded the Spartan women to act in <lb/>
            precisely the same manner as the Athenian women are acting. Spartan <lb/>
            plenipotentiaries arrive to treat for peace, and are met by Athenian <lb/>
            plenipotentiaries appointed for the same purpose. Lysistrata harangues <lb/>
            both parties, and by judicious management brings them to an agreement <lb/>
            on all points. Peace is made, and to celebrate the event the ambassadors <lb/>
            are invited by the women to a friendly banquet, which apparently takes <lb/>
            place in the Acropolis, the <foreign xml:lang="grc">θυρωρὸς</foreign> who appears on the stage being, I <lb/>
            imagine, the <foreign xml:lang="grc">θυρωρὸς</foreign> who took charge of the gates of the Propylaea ; see <lb/>
            Dyer's Ancient Athens, p. 355. And at the termination of the banquet <lb/>
            the guests reappear in a very festive mood; and the drama comes to <lb/>
            a close amidst songs, and dances, and general rejoicings.</p>
          <p>My version of the Lysistrata was published, without text or commentary, <lb/>
            in the year 1878. I am not aware of any other poetical translation in <lb/>
            our language.</p>
          <p>A piece called " Lysistrata, a modern paraphrase from the Greek of <lb/>
            Aristophanes," was produced last autumn by Miss Gertrude Kingston at <lb/>
            the Little Theatre. I had the pleasure of seeing it on October 22, 1910. <lb/>
            It was admirably put on the stage, and admirably acted; and the Play <lb/>
            itself was an extremely clever adaptation, by Mr. Laurence Housman, of <lb/>
            the Aristophanic Comedy ; but it did not profess to be, and was not in <lb/>
            any sense, an actual translation of the Greek.</p>

          <p>In the background we see the Pro­ <lb/>
            pylaea, the splendid portals of the <lb/>
            Athenian Acropolis. Before them, on <lb/>
            the slope by which they are reached <lb/>
            from the Lower City, Lysistrata, a young <lb/>
            and beautiful woman, is standing alone. <lb/>
            Like Praxagora in the Ecclesiazusae, <lb/>
            she has summoned her friends to meet <lb/>
            her at the dawn of day; the dawn has <lb/>
            arrived, but her friends have not made <lb/>
            their appearance. After exhibiting <lb/>
            various signs of anxiety and impatience, <lb/>
            she suddenly breaks out into words, the <lb/>
            abruptness with which she commences <lb/>
            bearing witness to the indignation <lb/>
            which she feels. Why, had they been <lb/>
            invited, she exclaims, to the worship of a <lb/>
            God of Wine or Love,—the chief objects <lb/>
            of devotion, according to Aristophanes, <lb/>
            to the Athenian women—they would <lb/>
            have arrived in crowds before this.</p>
          <p>Of Bacchus and his orgies, and of the <lb/>
            part which women (<foreign xml:lang="grc">αἱ Βάκχαι</foreign>) played in <lb/>
            them, and of the timbrels which he and <lb/>
            Rhea invented (<foreign xml:lang="grc">τύμπανα</foreign>, ‛<foreign xml:lang="grc">Ρέας</foreign> TIE <foreign xml:lang="grc">μητρὸςἐμά <lb/>
            θ</foreign>’ <foreign xml:lang="grc">εὑρήματα</foreign> Eur. Bacchae 59) and which <lb/>
            formed the invariable accompaniment <lb/>
            of his worship (Id. 124, 125, 156, &amp;c., <lb/>
            Here. Fur. 888, Cyclops 65, 205, Catullus <lb/>
            lxiv. 262), it is unnecessary here to <lb/>
            speak. I should be ashamed, says Hera to <lb/>
            Zeus, in Lucian's eighteenth Dialogue <lb/>
            of the Gods, to have a son like Bacchus <lb/>
            who dresses effeminately and goes about <lb/>
            with mad women, dancing to the sound of <lb/>
            timbrels, and pipes, and cymbals, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὺπὸ <lb/>
            τυμπάνοις, καὶ αὐλοῖς, καὶ κυμβάλοις χο­ <lb/>
            ρεύων</foreign>. The expression <foreign xml:lang="grc">εἰς Βακχεῖον</foreign> might <lb/>
            mean either to the shrine, or to the <lb/>
            revelry of Bacchus ; but the words which <lb/>
            follow, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἢ</foreign> ’<foreign xml:lang="grc">ςΠανὸς</foreign>, seem decisive in favour <lb/>
            of the former interpretation.-Amidst <lb/>
            the various personages who figured in the <lb/>
            orgies of Bacchus, none occupied a more <lb/>
            conspicuous position than Pan, himself <lb/>
            of all beings the most <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐρωτικός</foreign>. In Lu­ <lb/>
            cian's Bis Aecusatus, 9, he is described <lb/>
            as being <foreign xml:lang="grc">τῶν Διονύσου θεραπόντων ὸ</foreign> BnK­ <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">χικώτατος</foreign>. And in the twenty-second <lb/>
            Dialogue of the Gods he himself boasts <lb/>
            that Dionysus has made him the leader <lb/>
            of the Bacchic choir, and can do nothing <lb/>
            without him.—The names <foreign xml:lang="grc">Κωλιὰς</foreign> and <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">Γενετυλλὶς</foreign> are sometimes applied to <lb/>
            Aphrodite herself, but sometimes (and <lb/>
            always when in the plural, as in Thesm. <lb/>
            130) to the subordinate love-deities who <lb/>
            formed her train. They are constantly <lb/>
            mentioned together, as the patrons and <lb/>
            representatives of pampered and luxu­ <pb n="-"/>

              rious love. So in Clouds 52. So in <lb/>
              Alciphron (iii. 11) an honest country­ <lb/>
              man complains that his wife is con­ <lb/>
              sorting with luxurious city-ladies, and <lb/>
              devoting herself to worship <foreign xml:lang="grc">Κωλιάδας</foreign> <lb/>
              and <foreign xml:lang="grc">Γενετυλλίδας</foreign> and other fashionable <lb/>
              divinities. So in Lucian's Amores, 42, <lb/>
              it is said that wives take up with deities <lb/>
              whose very names are unknown to their <lb/>
              husbands, <foreign xml:lang="grc">Κωλιάδς, εἰ τύχοι, καὶ Γενε­ <lb/>
              τυλλίδας</foreign>. The name <foreign xml:lang="grc">Γενετυλλὶς</foreign> is no <lb/>
              doubt derived, as the Scholiasts both <lb/>
              here and on the Clouds observe, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀπὸ <lb/>
              τῆς γενέσεως τῶν παίδων</foreign>. For the name <lb/>
              <foreign xml:lang="grc">Κωλιὰς</foreign> they give several fanciful deri­ <lb/>
              vations, as that a Victor's daughter, <lb/>
              moved with love, unloosed the chains <lb/>
              which bound the limbs, <foreign xml:lang="grc">κῶλα</foreign>, of his <lb/>
              prisoner. Possibly it was derived from <lb/>
              Cape Colias, a low promontory some <lb/>
              two or three miles from Phalerum, as to <lb/>
              which Pausanias (Attica i. 4) says <foreign xml:lang="grc">Κω­ <lb/>
              λιάδος δέ ἐστιν ἐνταῦθα</foreign> ’<foreign xml:lang="grc">Αφροδίτης ἄγαλμα <lb/>

              Dodwell's Tour i. 427.</p>
          <p>5. <foreign xml:lang="grc">κωμῆτις</foreign>] neighbour. Over and above <lb/>
            the general distribution of all Attica <lb/>
            into demes, Athens itself was, for muni­ <lb/>
            cipal purposes, also divided into certain <lb/>
            quarters or wards which were termed <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">κῶμαι</foreign> or <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἄμφοδα</foreign>, Isocrates, Areop. 52 <lb/>
            (p. 149). Hence <foreign xml:lang="grc">κωμήτης</foreign> or (in the <lb/>
            feminine) <foreign xml:lang="grc">κωμῆτις</foreign> is used, as the Scho­ <lb/>
            liast observes, dirt <foreign xml:lang="grc">τοῦ γείτων κῶμαι δε τὰ <lb/>
            ἄμφοδα</foreign>. So too Hesychius, Photius, <lb/>
            Suidas s.v., and the Scholiast on Clouds <lb/>
            965.</p>
          <p>8. <foreign xml:lang="grc">τοξοποιεῖν</foreign>] This does not mean, as <lb/>
            the Oxford Lexicographers translate it, <lb/>
            "to arch the brow like a supercilious <lb/>
            person." It means to knit the brows <lb/>
            like a vexed and angry person, <foreign xml:lang="grc">τοξοπιεῖν <lb/>
            τὰς ὀφρῦς, συστρέφειν αὐτάς</foreign>.—Hesychius. <lb/>
            Thus in Longus (Pastorals iv. 16) Diony­ <lb/>
            sophanes, being enraged with Gnatho, <lb/>
            bids him hold his tongue, <foreign xml:lang="grc">σφόδρα τὴν <lb/>
            ὀφρῦν εἰς αὐτὸν τοξοπιήσας</foreign>. And in <lb/>
            Alciphron (iii. 19) the captured and <lb/>
            scowling robber <foreign xml:lang="grc">δριμὺ βλέπει</foreign> Kat <foreign xml:lang="grc">τοξο­ <lb/>
            ποιεῖ τὰς ὀφρῦς</foreign>. The comparison is not <lb/>
            between (1) a single eyebrow arched, <lb/>
            and (2) a bow drawn to a semicircle, <lb/>
            but between (1) a frown which knits <lb/>
            together both eyebrows, and (2) a bow <lb/>
            unstrung, and so forming one line with <lb/>
            a slight double curve. With Calonice's <lb/>
            advice compare Alciphron i. 34 (to which <lb/>
            Bergler also refers), where Thais says to <lb/>
            Euthydemus <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐ πρέπει σκυθρωποῖς εἶναι <lb/>

          <p>12. <foreign xml:lang="grc">πανοῦργοι</foreign>] It seems to me that <lb/>
            this passage has been misunderstood <lb/>
            by all the Commentators. They take <lb/>
            Lysistrata to mean that men are always <lb/>
            describing women as <foreign xml:lang="grc">πανοῦργοι</foreign>, and now <lb/>
            she finds they are right. She really <lb/>
            means that now she finds they are <lb/>
            wrong. "Id graviter fert," says Enger, <lb/>
            " quod quum nequam esse mulieres viri <lb/>
            existiment, idem ipsa nunc experta est." <lb/>
            But though <foreign xml:lang="grc">πανοῦργος</foreign> may often be <lb/>
            translated by “nequam” worthless, good <lb/>
            for nothing, it really means more than <lb/>
            that. A blockhead may be worthless, <lb/>
            but he could not be a <foreign xml:lang="grc">πανοῦργος</foreign>, for <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">πανουγία</foreign> implies shrewdness, <foreign xml:lang="grc">δεινότης</foreign>, <lb/>
            though shrewdness exerted for an un­ <lb/>
            worthy purpose. <foreign xml:lang="grc">δεινότης</foreign>, says Aristotle <lb/>
            (Eth. Nic. vi. 12), <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἂνμὲν ὀ σκοπὸς ᾖ καλὸς, <lb/>
            ἐπαινετή ἐστιν ἂν δὲ φαῦλος, πανουργία</foreign>. <lb/>
            A <foreign xml:lang="grc">πανοῦργος</foreign> is a fourbe, like Molière's <lb/>
            Scapin. In the Frogs Dionysus pro­ <lb/>
            poses to bring back from Hades Euri­ <lb/>
            pides rather than Sophocles, because <lb/>
            the former, being a <foreign xml:lang="grc">πανουργος</foreign>, will be <lb/>
            quite up to running away. “<foreign xml:lang="grc">Πανουρ­ <lb/>
            γῶς</foreign> !" is the admiring and delighted <lb/>
            comment of a slave in Menander, where <lb/>
            a girl is explaining to him her artful <lb/>
            scheme for outwitting the Master; Me­ <lb/>
            nander's "Arbitration," line 318 (ed. <lb/>
            Capps): see Professor Capps's note. St. <lb/>
            Paul, writing to the Corinthians, sup­ <lb/>
            poses an adverse suggestion, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὑπάρχων <lb/>
            πανοῦργος, δόλῳ ὑμᾶς ἔλαβον</foreign>, which our <lb/>
            translators render with sufficient ac­ <lb/>
            curacy being crafty, I caught you with <lb/>
            guile." By the men then the women <lb/>
            had been described as <foreign xml:lang="grc">πανοῦργοι</foreign>, up to <lb/>
            anything,full of shifts and resources ; but <lb/>
            Lysistrata, when she would combine <lb/>

            were the most delicious contribution <lb/>

              been an Illyrian tribe, whose connexion <lb/>
              with Boeotia arose from the fact that the <lb/>

              expelled from Thebes by the Epigoni, <lb/>
              took refuge within their borders, Hdt. <lb/>

            trasted with conceiving in the mind. It <lb/>
            was the spoken word, not the thought, <lb/>

              she has said of the other powers, but <lb/>
              leaves Calonice to supply those words <lb/>
              for herself. So in Acharnians 318 Di­ <lb/>
              caeopolis will not speak of his head <lb/>
              being cut off, but intends the audience <lb/>
              to understand what he means. So in <lb/>
              Plato's fifth Epigram he throws an apple <lb/>
              to his love, and begs her, if she loves <lb/>
              him, to accept it; but if-he will not <lb/>
              say if she loves him not, but puts it as <lb/>
              follows—<foreign xml:lang="grc">εἰ δ</foreign>’ <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἄρ</foreign>’ o <foreign xml:lang="grc">μὴ γίνοιτο νοεῖς</foreign>, then <lb/>
              still let her take it, and remember how <lb/>
              short-lived is its bloom and hers. In all <lb/>
              such cases the speaker, although he will <lb/>
              not utter the ill-omened words, yet wishes <lb/>
              his meaning to be understood exactly as <lb/>
              if he had uttered them. And Brunck's <lb/>
              change of <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀλλ</foreign>’ (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀλλὰ</foreign>) in the present <lb/>
              line into <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἄλλ</foreign>’ (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἄλλο</foreign>), with the sense of <lb/>

              makes no allusion to hair-dye, but by <lb/>

              —Scholiast. So rapid, after the death of <lb/>
              Pericles, had been the deterioration of <lb/>
              the Athenian character, that whereas <lb/>
              the Athenians had formerly been dis­ <lb/>
              tinguished for being always on the alert <lb/>
              and beforehand with their opponents <lb/>
              (Thuc. i. 70), they are now on the <lb/>
              contrary always behindhand, <foreign xml:lang="grc">τοῦ δέοντος <lb/>
              ὕστερον</foreign>. The system which Pericles <lb/>
              introduced of removing all restrictions <lb/>
              upon the popular will, and so relaxing <lb/>
              the bonds of discipline and political <lb/>
              self-control, naturally tended (when his <lb/>
              strong hand no longer guided the reins) <lb/>
              to make the Athenians, as Plato says, <lb/>
              <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀργοὺς καὶ δειλοὺς καὶ λάλους</foreign>, Gorgias, <lb/>
              chap. 71. In the following century this <lb/>
              became a common topic of complaint <lb/>
              with the Athenian orators. See Demos­ <lb/>
              thenes, First Philippic, pp. 49, 50.</p>
          <p>58. <foreign xml:lang="grc">Παράλων</foreign>] the people of the coast, <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">τῶν ἐν παράλῳ οἰκουσῶν. Παραλία γὰρ <lb/>
            μοῖρα τῆς Ἀττικῆς</foreign>.—Scholiast. It was one <lb/>
            of the three districts into which Pandion <lb/>
            divided Attica, giving them to three of <lb/>
            his sons. Paralia he gave to Pallas. <lb/>
            He had a fourth son, Nisus, to whom <lb/>
            he gave Megara and Salamis.</p>
          <p>59. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐκ Σαλαμῖνος</foreign>] While they are wait­ <lb/>
            ing for the arrival of the other women, <lb/>
            Aristophanes takes the opportunity of <lb/>
            raising the laughter of the audience by <lb/>
            a few farcical jokes. He mentions the <lb/>
            Salaminian women, to lead up to Calo­ <lb/>
            nice's remark that they, no doubt, have <lb/>
            been from daybreak crossing (the straits <lb/>
            which separate Salamis from the main­ <lb/>
            land) in their skiffs, <foreign xml:lang="grc">κέλητες</foreign>. The word <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">κελης</foreign> means either a skiff or a riding- <lb/>
            horse, and in the latter sense is used to <lb/>
            signify the particular <foreign xml:lang="grc">σχῆμα συνουσίας</foreign> <lb/>
            to which allusion is again made infra <lb/>
            191 and 619. See Wasps 501, Peace <lb/>
            900, Thesm. 153. Jokes of this kind <lb/>
            seem to have been specially employed <lb/>
            in connexion with Salamis; infra 411, <lb/>
            Eccl. 38. And as to <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὄρθριαι</foreign>, at early <lb/>

            are mentioned for the sake of the jest <lb/>
            upon Theagenes (<foreign xml:lang="grc">οὗτός ἐστιν ὁ Ἀχαρνεὺς</foreign>, <lb/>
            Scholiast on Wasps 1183), whose noto­ <lb/>

            without consulting the shrine of Hecate <lb/>
            at his house-door (see Wasps 804 and <lb/>
            the Commentary there) is here trans­ <lb/>

            67. <foreign xml:lang="grc">Ἀναγυρουντόθεν</foreign>] After Salamis <lb/>
            and Acharnae we are introduced to <lb/>
            the deme of Anagyrus, in order that <lb/>
            Calonice may play upon the words of <lb/>
            the proverb <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀνάγυρον κινεῖν</foreign>, a proverb <lb/>
            however referring not to the deme, but <lb/>
            to the strong-smelling shrub known to <lb/>
            our botanists as Anagyris foetida, "stink­ <lb/>
            ing bean-trefoil." It is a bushy plant, <lb/>
            growing to the height of eight or ten <lb/>
            feet, with laburnum-like flowers of a <lb/>
            bright yellow and long seed-pods; and <lb/>
            was found in great profusion about the <lb/>
            Attic village of Anagyrus. It had a <lb/>
            most nauseous smell, <foreign xml:lang="grc">φυτὸν δυσῶδες</foreign>, <lb/>
            Hesychius, Suidas, Zenobius ii. 55, <foreign xml:lang="grc">βαρύ­ <lb/>
            οσμος ἰσχυρῶς</foreign>, Dioscorides iii. 67, "gravis <lb/>
            odore," Pliny xxvii. 13; and when <lb/>
            bruised gave out the scent in a pecu­ <lb/>
            liarly offensive manner (<foreign xml:lang="grc">τριβόμενος ὄζει</foreign>, <lb/>
            Suidas). Hence arose the proverb <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀνά</foreign>­ <lb/>
            yvpov <foreign xml:lang="grc">κινεῖν</foreign>, used of persons who bring <lb/>
            upon themselves some unpleasant re- <lb/>
            SUITS, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπὶ τῶν κινούντων τινα ἐπὶ κακῷ <lb/>
            αὐτοῖς</foreign>. The proverb is given by all the <lb/>
            paroemiographers, Bodleian 56, Coislin <lb/>
            31, Diogenianus i. 25 and 52, Zenobius <lb/>
            ii. 55 (Gaisford, pp. 6,123, 158,160, 266), <lb/>
            and Suidas. Calonice therefore, seeing <lb/>
            the village dames of Anagyrus hurrying <lb/>
            in before the rest, exclaims We have <lb/>
            stirred up Anagyrus with a vengeance. <lb/>
            She is referring to the village, but she <lb/>
            plays on the proverb which refers to the <lb/>
            shrub.</p>
          <p>70. <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐκ ἐπαινῶ, Μυρρίνη</foreign>] So Thesm. <lb/>
            1213 <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐκ ἐπαινῶ, γρᾴδιο</foreign>. The plucky <lb/>
            little Myrrhina was already Lysistrata's <lb/>
            right-hand woman, and her dilatoriness <lb/>
            was therefore all the more disappoint­ <lb/>
            ing. She attempts to make up for it <pb n="12"/>
            <figure type="illustration">

              by falling in at once with Lysistrata's <lb/>
              objections.</p>

            χρόνον</foreign>.—Scholiast. Just as <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐμου̑ γ' εἵνεκα</foreign> <lb/>
            means sofar as I am concerned,so <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὀλίουγ' <lb/>
            εἵνεκα</foreign> means so far as a short time is con­ <lb/>
            cerned.</p>
          <p>77. <foreign xml:lang="grc">Λαμπιτώ</foreign>] Lampito was the name <lb/>
            of the wife of Archidamus, the Spar­ <lb/>
            tan king who commanded the expedi­ <lb/>
            tions into Attica during the early years <lb/>
            of the Peloponnesian War, Hdt. vi. 71. <lb/>
            She was the daughter of King Leoty­ <lb/>
            chides and the mother of King Agis. <lb/>
            By Plato (Ale. i. 18, p. 123 E) and <lb/>
            Plutarch (Agesilaus ad init.) she is <lb/>
            called <foreign xml:lang="grc">Λαμπιδώ</foreign>. Here there is probably <lb/>
            no specific allusion to the Spartan <lb/>
            queen; her name is merely taken as <lb/>
            the name of a Spartan woman. Hither­ <lb/>
            to all the women on the stage have been <lb/>
            Athenians ; but now representatives of <lb/>
            the enemy make their appearance; <lb/>
            Lampito comes from Sparta, and with <lb/>
            her are delegates from Boeotia and <lb/>
            Corinth, the two most powerful members, <lb/>
            under Sparta, of the Peloponnesian <lb/>
            confederacy, and at this time the two <lb/>
            bitterest enemies of Athens. Lysistrata <lb/>
            greets them with enthusiasm.</p>
          <p>81. <foreign xml:lang="grc">σιώ</foreign>] <foreign xml:lang="grc">τοὺς Διοσκόρους λέγει. Λακωνι­ <lb/>
            κω̑ς δὲ φθέγγεται, ώς οἱ 'Αττικοὶ νη τὼ θεὼ, <lb/>
            ἤτοι τὴν κόρην καὶ τὴν Δήμητρα</foreign>.—Scho­ <lb/>
            liast. The " Twain '' in the mouth of <lb/>
            an Athenian meant Demeter and Perse­ <lb/>
            phone, and the oath by their names <lb/>
            could be taken by women only; Eccl. <lb/>
            158. The " Twain " in the mouth of a <lb/>
            Spartan meant Castor and Polydeuces, <lb/>
            and the oath could be taken by men as <lb/>
            well as by women; infra 983, &amp;c. So <lb/>
            both Lampito and the Herald swear by <lb/>
            Castor; infra 206,988. If we may judge <lb/>
            by the examples given in this Play, the <lb/>
            speech of a Spartan was frequently <lb/>
            tempered by the parenthetical use of <lb/>
            the word <foreign xml:lang="grc">οἰω̑</foreign> ; cf. infra 156, 998, 1256. <lb/>
            The Dorians here, as elsewhere, speak <lb/>
            in the Doric tongue; but here, as else­ <lb/>
            where, Aristophanes moulds the rigour <lb/>
            of an unfamiliar dialect so as to make <lb/>
            it more harmonious to the ear, and <lb/>
            more intelligible to the mind, of an <lb/>

              the Commentators set themselves to <lb/>
              reverse the good taste and good sense <lb/>
              of the Athenian, by overloading the <lb/>
              lines with the strictest Doric forms. I <lb/>
              have preferred to follow the best MSS. <lb/>
              and to present the lines as, according <lb/>
              to their testimony, Aristophanes wrote <lb/>
              them. See the Introduction to the <lb/>

            of Lycurgus required the Spartan girls, <lb/>
            as well as boys, to harden their bodies <lb/>
            and develop their physical energies by <lb/>

            and Calonice play upon this double <lb/>

            only in a secondary sense to the woman <lb/>

            (ix. 13) as <foreign xml:lang="grc">χώρη ἱππασίμη</foreign>. It was for <lb/>
            this reason that Mardonius, on the <lb/>
            approach of the Hellenic army, retired <lb/>
            from Attica to try his last fortune on <lb/>
            the plains of Boeotia, where there would <lb/>
            be more space for the operations of <lb/>
            cavalry; <foreign xml:lang="grc">καλὸν τὸ Βοιώτιον πεδίον</foreign>, he <lb/>

              common a battlefield for Hellas that <lb/>
              Epameinondas called it the " Orchestra <lb/>

              of these plains is shown by the circum­ <lb/>

              861 (and the Commentary there), 869, <lb/>
              and 874. So far as regards Boeotia <lb/>
              the country. As regards the Boeotian <lb/>

            <foreign xml:lang="grc">νὴ Δἴ, ὦ φίλη γύναι</foreign>, are in all the older <lb/>
            editions given to Lysistrata, and I have <lb/>
            so left them in the translation; but most <lb/>
            recent editors make them the commence­ <lb/>
            ment of Myrrhina's speech, and this <lb/>
            seems to be right.</p>
          <p>102. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὦτάλαν</foreign>] This and <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὦ τάλαινα</foreign> are <lb/>
            favourite ejaculations of Athenian wo­ <lb/>
            men in familiar conversation. As a rule, <lb/>
            they have no special reference to the <lb/>
            person addressed, but are intended <lb/>
            rather as a general exclamation at <lb/>
            the pitifulness or wonderfulness of the <lb/>
            situation.</p>
          <p>103. <foreign xml:lang="grc">φυλάττων Εὐκράτην</foreign>] We know no­ <lb/>
            thing of the circumstances to which the <lb/>
            speaker alludes, and the Scholiasts knew <lb/>
            no more than we do. Their explanation, <lb/>

            δὲ ως δωροδόκος καὶ προδότης καὶ ξένος</foreign>, is <lb/>
            obviously derived merely from the <lb/>
            Comedies themselves, and does not rest <lb/>
            on any independent historical basis. <lb/>
            And the last two words are almost cer­ <lb/>
            tainly erroneous. There is little doubt <lb/>
            that the Eucrates here mentioned was <lb/>
            the brother of the famous Nicias, who <lb/>
            was put to death under the Thirty some <lb/>
            seven years after the production of this <lb/>
            Comedy. It was also proposed to con­ <lb/>

              tion of the property of Nicias's brother " <lb/>
              is the peroration of a speech to be made <lb/>
              by the son of Eucrates against such pro­ <lb/>
              posed confiscation. It makes no mention <lb/>
              of the charge brought against the father, <lb/>
              nor does it contain anything which <lb/>
              throws light on the present allusion. <lb/>
              We can only guess that about the date <lb/>
              of the Lysistrata he was in command <lb/>
              of a military force in the Thraceward <lb/>
              regions (<foreign xml:lang="grc">τὰ ἐπὶ θρά̜κης</foreign>, see Peace 283 and <lb/>
              the note there); and was so strongly <lb/>
              suspected of some improper practices, <lb/>
              treasonable or otherwise, that his sol­ <lb/>
              diers were chiefly engaged in watching <lb/>
              (see Birds 513) the suspicious movements <lb/>
              of their own commander.</p>
          <p>104. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐν Πύλω̜</foreign>] This line is expressly <lb/>
            given by the Ravenna MS., and gene­ <lb/>
            rally, to Myrrhina, but some recent <lb/>
            editors have transferred it to Lysistrata <lb/>
            on the ground that Myrrhina's husband <lb/>
            will presently appear on the stage. We <lb/>
            may, however, be sure that the three <lb/>
            who complain of their misfortunes here <lb/>
            are the three who, infra 112-18, say <lb/>
            what they would do to get rid of them. <lb/>
            And indeed the old Attic Comedy took <lb/>
            no count of little inconsistencies of <lb/>
            this kind ; and besides, as at least five <lb/>
            days will have elapsed before Cinesias <lb/>
            makes his appearance, he might easily <lb/>
            during that interval have returned from <lb/>
            Pylus to Athens. Pylus was still in the <lb/>
            possession of the Athenians; see infra <lb/>
            1163. It was recaptured about two years <lb/>
            later.</p>
          <p>106. <foreign xml:lang="grc">πορπακισάμενος</foreign>] This is generally <lb/>
            translated "having taken up his shield "; <lb/>
            but though that would be the result of <lb/>
            the operation, it is not really the opera­ <lb/>
            tion itself described by the word. It <lb/>
            means having fastened the shield-strap to <lb/>
            the shield, and alludes to the Spartan <lb/>
            custom of having the straps or handles <lb/>
            of their shields made removable. A <lb/>
            Spartan, on his return from an expedi­ <lb/>
            tion, would remove the handle from the <lb/>
            shield, to ensure that the Helots, if they <lb/>
            were to rise in insurrrection, should not <lb/>
            seize it strapped ready for action. See <lb/>
            the Commentary on Knights 849. And <lb/>
            it was not until he was about to start <lb/>
            on a new expedition that he would re­ <lb/>

            portant operations between them and the <lb/>
            Athenians (Id.24-36). It had an evil repu­ <lb/>

            viii. 20, and see Plutus 1002 and the note <lb/>
            there); and the suggestion here is that <lb/>
            its panders to vice manufactured the <lb/>
            "penem coriaceum octo digitos longum" <lb/>
            which the women are accusedof employing.</p>
          <p>110. <foreign xml:lang="grc">σκυτίνη 'πικουρία</foreign>] She is playing <lb/>
            on the proverbial phrase <foreign xml:lang="grc">συκίνη ἐπικουρία</foreign> <lb/>
            which, as the Scholiast observes, was <lb/>
            applied to persons who give but a feeble <lb/>
            support to their friends, the wood of the <lb/>
            fig-tree being weak, and incapable of <lb/>
            yielding a firm support. <foreign xml:lang="grc">Σύκινον</foreign>, says <lb/>
            the Scholiast on Plutus 946, is equivalent <lb/>
            to <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀσθενέστατον. τὸ</foreign> yap <foreign xml:lang="grc">ξύλον τη̑ς συκη̑̑ς <lb/>
            ἀσθενὲς καὶ ἀνωφελὲς, ὅθεν καὶ " συκίνη <lb/>

            vov. Lysistrata means to express her <lb/>
            contempt for these artificial substitutes ; <lb/>
            but she changes <foreign xml:lang="grc">συκίνη</foreign> into <foreign xml:lang="grc">σκυτίνη</foreign>, be­ <lb/>
            cause she is dealing with <foreign xml:lang="grc">αἰδοι̑α δερμάτινα</foreign>. <lb/>
            Athenaeus (xii. 75) preserves a line from <lb/>
            a comedy of Strattis, <foreign xml:lang="grc">Σαννυρίωνος σκυτίνη <lb/>
            'πικουρία</foreign>, which has received many differ­ <lb/>
            ent interpretations, but as Athenaeus <lb/>
            is citing it in connexion with the ex­ <lb/>
            treme tenuity of Sannyrion, it probably <lb/>
            refers, as Dalecamp suggested, to the <lb/>
            leathern stays with which, we may <lb/>
            readily believe, he was accustomed to <lb/>
            support his person. No doubt which­ <lb/>
            ever was the later of the two Comedies <lb/>
            borrowed the phrase from the earlier.</p>

            see Thesm. 548 and the note there. <lb/>
            The Commentators mostly attach to <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">καταθει̑σαν</foreign> the signification of " pledg­ <lb/>

            mus ; the brill, Rhombus vulgaris. The <lb/>
            Rhombus of the Fourth Satire of Juvenal <lb/>
            must certainly have been a turbot. Calo­ <lb/>
            nice is alluding to the popular notion <lb/>
            that two flat fishes are in reality but one <lb/>
            fish cut in halves; a notion derived from <lb/>
            their peculiar shape and appearance, <lb/>

              physical fact of the situation is the <lb/>
              rocky barrier so close at hand. We are <lb/>
              under the lee of the mountains and <lb/>

            These are the matters on which all our <lb/>

            cognition, <foreign xml:lang="grc">εἴδη ἀναγνωρίσεως</foreign>, observes <lb/>

          <p>145. <foreign xml:lang="grc">μόνη τούτων γυνή</foreign>] The precise <lb/>
            meaning of these words is extremely <lb/>
            doubtful. They are generally trans­ <lb/>
            lated " the only woman of them all," <lb/>
            " sola harum femina " (Brunck, follow­ <lb/>
            ing Bergler); which, considering the <lb/>
            judgement just pronounced by the <lb/>
            speaker on her sex, would be but a <lb/>
            sorry compliment. It seems to me that <lb/>
            the word <foreign xml:lang="grc">γυνὴ</foreign> applies to the entire line, <lb/>
            to <foreign xml:lang="grc">φιλτάτη</foreign> as well as <foreign xml:lang="grc">μόνη</foreign>, just as if it <lb/>
            had run <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὦ φιλτάτη γυνὴ σὺ καὶ τουτων <lb/>
            μόνη</foreign>. And this, I think, was the Scho­ <lb/>
            liast's view who explains <foreign xml:lang="grc">μόνη</foreign>] by <foreign xml:lang="grc">μόνη <lb/>
            γυνὴ δυναμέη μηχανὴν εὑρε̑ν</foreign> ; an interpre­ <lb/>
            tation, however, which cannot be strictly <lb/>
            accurate. In my opinion Lysistrata is <lb/>
            referring to the words she employed <lb/>
            just above, <foreign xml:lang="grc">μόνη μετ ἐμου̑</foreign>, and means <lb/>
            that Lampito is the only one with her, <pb n="21"/>
            <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BELL_07_fig68.jpg"/></figure> <lb/>
              not only <foreign xml:lang="grc">φιλτάτη</foreign> but the only one of <lb/>
              them all who is so, the Abdiel of the <lb/>
              cause. In her enthusiasm she speaks <lb/>
              abruptly, but means (to borrow from <lb/>
              my own translation) " 0 dearest friend, <lb/>
              my one true friend of all." And so, <lb/>
              I imagine, Florent Chretien understood <lb/>
              the line, when he translated it " 0 om­ <lb/>
              nium harum sola dulcis foemina." And <lb/>
              in claiming the Spartan woman as her <lb/>
              one true friend of all, the Athenian <lb/>
              woman may seem to have been endowed <lb/>
              with a sort of prescience, since seven <lb/>
              years later, when the day of doom ar­ <lb/>
              rived for Athens, Sparta proved herself <lb/>
              in very truth her " one true friend of <lb/>
              all," by resolutely standing between <lb/>
              her and the vengeance of her enemies. <lb/>
              See the Introduction to the Ecclesia­ <lb/>

              It is noteworthy that though here, as <lb/>
              supra 42-8, Lysistrata expounds in the <lb/>
              clearest manner her plan of the cam­ <lb/>

              totally different lines. Not for one <lb/>

              endeavouring to attract the men. On <lb/>
              the contrary they keep out of their way <lb/>

            Acropolis in their exclusive possession, <lb/>
            that the men may not obtain for their <lb/>
            warlike purposes the silver in the temple <lb/>
            of the Goddess, <foreign xml:lang="grc">παρὰ τᾳ̑ σιῷ</foreign>. For the <lb/>
            Athenian treasury was the inner cham­ <lb/>
            ber at the back of Athene's Temple ; <lb/>
            though whether that temple was the <lb/>
            Erechtheium (as the Scholiast on Plutus <lb/>
            1193 says, and as we should naturally <lb/>
            expect) or the Parthenon (as the remains <lb/>
            of the two temples have led antiquaries <lb/>
            to believe) is a doubtful and difficult <lb/>
            question. See the Commentary on the <lb/>
            passage of the Plutus.</p>

          <p>184. <foreign xml:lang="grc">Σκύθαινα</foreign>] Scythianess. That the <lb/>
            Scythian archers were employed to keep <lb/>
            order in the Athenian Assemblies is <lb/>
            plain from innumerable passages, such <lb/>
            as Ach. 54, Eccl. 143: see the Com­ <lb/>
            mentary on the latter passage. The <lb/>
            Assembly of Women is therefore in like <lb/>
            manner attended by Scythianesses. And <lb/>
            just as those rude barbarians were ridi­ <lb/>
            culed for their habit of staring idly <lb/>
            about them (see infra 426), so here the <lb/>
            Scythianess is at once made to merit <lb/>
            and receive the same rebuke.</p>
          <p>186. <foreign xml:lang="grc">τόμια</foreign>] The severed parts of the <lb/>
            victim, over which the most solemn <lb/>
            oaths were taken. Bergler refers to <lb/>
            Demosthenes against Aristocrates 79 (p. <lb/>
            642), where it is said that, in a trial <lb/>
            for murder before the Areopagus, the <lb/>
            Accuser is required to swear not any <lb/>
            common form of oath, but <foreign xml:lang="grc">στὰς ἐπὶ τῶν <lb/>
            τομίων κάπρου</foreign> (infra 202) <foreign xml:lang="grc">καὶ κριοῦ</foreign> (infra <lb/>

          <p>188. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐν Αἰσχύλῳ</foreign>] The allusion, as the <lb/>
            Scholiast observes, is to Septem 42, <lb/>
            where the Messenger is describing the <lb/>
            proceedings in the invaders' camp : <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BELL_07_fig76.jpg"/></figure> <lb/>
              The substitution here of <foreign xml:lang="grc">μηλοσφαγούσας</foreign> <lb/>
              for <foreign xml:lang="grc">ταυροσφαγοῦντες</foreign>, if not a mere inad­ <lb/>
              vertence, is probably due to the double <lb/>
              meaning of <foreign xml:lang="grc">ταῦρος</foreign> (infra 217) and <foreign xml:lang="grc">μη̑λα</foreign> <lb/>
              (supra 155). This mode of pledging <lb/>
              faith was practised even in historic <lb/>
              times. The Hellenic army of the Anaba­ <lb/>
              sis, and that of Ariaeus, after the battle <lb/>
              of Cunaxa, swore to be faithful to each <lb/>

              a woman, she would not be very familiar <lb/>
              with the old Tragedian.</p>
          <p>191. <foreign xml:lang="grc">λευκὸν ἳππον</foreign>] The sacrifice of <lb/>
            white horses was not an uncommon <lb/>
            occurrence. Blaydes refers to Hdt. vii. <lb/>
            113, Lucian's Scytha 2. But in recom­ <lb/>
            mending it here Calonice is doubtless <lb/>
            referring to the <foreign xml:lang="grc">σχῆμα συνουσίας</foreign> men­ <lb/>
            tioned in the note on 59 supra. The <lb/>
            " grey mare " which I have substituted <lb/>
            for it in the translation is borrowed <lb/>
            from the old proverb, "The grey mare <lb/>
            is the better horse," Hudibras ii. 2. 698. <lb/>
            In Lysistrata's contemptuous reply <foreign xml:lang="grc">ποῖ <lb/>
            λευκὸν ἳππον</foreign>, as again in 383 infra, 7roi is <lb/>
            employed in the sense so common with <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ποῖον</foreign> : White horse indeed!</p>
          <p>195. <foreign xml:lang="grc">μέλαιναν κύλικα</foreign>] The cup is to be <lb/>
            black (as so many of the Greek cups and <lb/>
            vases are) in analogy to the black-bound <lb/>
            shield of Aeschylus, in the lines quoted <lb/>
            in the note on 188 supra. And just <lb/>
            as Calonice's proposal may have been <lb/>
            prompted by the passage, referred to <lb/>
            in the preceding note, from the Seventh <lb/>
            Book of Herodotus, so Myrrhina's pro­ <lb/>
            posal may have been prompted by the <lb/>
            description in his Fourth Book (chap. 70) <lb/>
            of the Scythian method of making trea­ <lb/>
            ties ; <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐς κύλικα μεγάλην κεραμίνην οἶνον <lb/>
            ἐγχέαντες</foreign>, they mingle with it a little of <lb/>
            their own blood, and then after dipping <lb/>
            their weapons into it, and making long <lb/>
            prayers, they and their chief followers <lb/>
            drink it off.</p>
          <p>196. <foreign xml:lang="grc">Θάσιον</foreign>] Many passages in praise <lb/>
            of the “dark Thasian wine ” (<foreign xml:lang="grc">Θασίου <lb/>
            μέλανος</foreign> ’<foreign xml:lang="grc">Αριστοφάνης Κωκάλῳ</foreign>) are cited <lb/>
            by Athenaeus i, chaps. 51, 52, 53, 56. <lb/>
            It was of all wines the most fragrant, <lb/>
            see Eccl. 1119, Plutus 1021 and the <lb/>
            Commentary there; and hence the ex­ <lb/>
            clamation of Lampito, ten lines below. <lb/>
            And possibly the wine which Achilles <lb/>
            Tatius describes as <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸν μέλανα τὸν ἀνθοσ­ <lb/>
            μίαν</foreign> was none other than the Thasian. <lb/>
            Probably too its fragrance made it a <lb/>
            special favourite with the Athenian <lb/>
            women, for each time that Aristophanes <lb/>
            mentions it lie places it in a woman's <lb/>

          <p>197. <foreign xml:lang="grc">μὴ ᾽πιχεῖν ὓδωρ</foreign>] These words are <lb/>
            of course added <foreign xml:lang="grc">παρὰ προσδοκίαν</foreign>, for the <lb/>
            purpose of satirizing the alleged vinous <lb/>
            propensities of the women, <foreign xml:lang="grc">εἰς μέθην <lb/>
            κωμῳδῶν τὰς γυναῖκας</foreign>; as the Scholiast <lb/>
            says. The expected words were neither <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">μὴ λύειν τὴν εἰρήνην</foreign>, as the Scholiast sug­ <lb/>
            gests, nor yet <foreign xml:lang="grc">καταλύειν τὸν πόλεμον</foreign> as <lb/>
            Bergler puts it, but <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀπέχεσθαι κ.τ.λ</foreign>., that <lb/>
            is, to act as Lysistrata proposed.</p>
          <p>198. <foreign xml:lang="grc">φεῦ δᾶ</foreign>] This Doric ejaculation is <lb/>
            used by both Aeschylus and Euripides <lb/>
            in their Choral Odes, and Aristophanes <lb/>
            probably borrowed it without much re­ <lb/>
            gard to its meaning or to its derivation. <lb/>
            It is uncertain whether <foreign xml:lang="grc">δᾶ</foreign> is connected <lb/>
            with <foreign xml:lang="grc">Δεὺς</foreign> (<foreign xml:lang="grc">Ζεὺς</foreign>), or with <foreign xml:lang="grc">γῆ</foreign> (as is asserted <lb/>
            by the Scholiast on Agamemnon 1039, <lb/>
            and the author of the Etym. Magn. s.v. <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀλευάδα</foreign>) ; or whether it merely stands <lb/>
            for <foreign xml:lang="grc">δὴ</foreign>, and should be written <foreign xml:lang="grc">δά</foreign>. With <lb/>
            the words <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἂφατον ὡς ἐπαινίω</foreign>, I can't <lb/>
            describe to you how I approve the oath, <lb/>
            compare Birds 428 <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἂφατον ὡς φρόνιμος</foreign>, <lb/>
            I can't describe to you how sagacious he is. <lb/>
            And cf. infra 1080, 1148.</p>
          <p>200. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὁ κεραμὼν ὃσος</foreign>] In answer to <lb/>
            Lysistrata's summons an attendant <lb/>
            brings out a wine-jar and a cup, both <lb/>
            of prodigious size. The magnitude of <lb/>
            the earthen jar extorts from Calonice <lb/>
            the delighted exclamation, 0, what a big <lb/>
            Wine-jar! And either she, or a friend (for <lb/>
            many with great probability transfer the <lb/>
            next line to Myrrhina), proceeds to con­ <lb/>
            gratulate herself on the size of the cup : <lb/>
            that is a cup 'twould give onejoy to handle.</p>
          <p>202. TOO <foreign xml:lang="grc">κάπρου</foreign>] Lysistrata tells the <lb/>
            attendant to set down the cup, and to <lb/>
            take up the Wine-jar for the purpose of <lb/>
            pouring out the wine. As Bergler re­ <lb/>
            marks, she speaks of the Jar as if it were <lb/>
            a victim whose blood they are about to <lb/>
            shed. And while the Jar is being lifted <lb/>
            she utters two lines of prayer, trusting <lb/>
            that the Goddess of Persuasiveness and <lb/>
            the Loving Cup will accept their sacri­ <lb/>
            fice (as she calls the Wine) and be <lb/>
            propitious to the women's cause.</p>
          <p>203. <foreign xml:lang="grc">Πειθοῖ</foreign>] They invoke Peitho be­ <lb/>
            cause by her aid, as the special minister <lb/>
            and confidante of Aphrodite (if she were <lb/>
            not rather Aphrodite herself under an­ <lb/>
            other aspect), they hope to persuade the <pb n="28"/>
            <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BELL_07_fig79.jpg"/></figure> <lb/>
              men to terminate the war. They invoke <lb/>
              the Cup of friendship because by means <lb/>
              of the friendly league, to which they are <lb/>
              about to pledge themselves over the <lb/>
              Cup of Thasian wine, they hope to inau­ <lb/>
              gurate a reign of peace and friendship <lb/>
              throughout the Hellenic world. On the <lb/>
              <foreign xml:lang="grc">κύλιξ φιλοτησία</foreign> see Ach. 985 and the <lb/>
              Commentary there. The Cup was im­ <lb/>
              mediately before them; and probably <lb/>
              full in sight arose the ancient Temple <lb/>
              of Aphrodite Pandemus and Peitho, <lb/>
              which Theseus erected as a seal and <lb/>
              emblem of the incorporation of all the <lb/>
              domes of Attica into a single state, <lb/>
              Pausanias i. 22. 3. Hence, perhaps, the <lb/>
              word <foreign xml:lang="grc">δέσποινα</foreign>, like <foreign xml:lang="grc">δέσποινα Νίκη</foreign> infra <lb/>
              317, as of a present deity. On the great <lb/>
              throne of Zeus at Olympia Peitho was <lb/>
              represented crowning Aphrodite new <lb/>
              risen from the sea, Pausanias v. 11. 3.</p>
          <p>205. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀποπυτίζει καλῶς</foreign>] gushes out splen­ <lb/>
            didly (that is,propitiously, cf. Peace 1054, <lb/>
            Birds 1118, &amp;c.), as of a victim's blood. <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ταῦτα δὲ λέγει</foreign>, says the Scholiast, <foreign xml:lang="grc">μιμου­ <lb/>
            μένη τοὺς θυοσκόους, τουτέστι τοὺς ἱερεῖς. <lb/>
            ταῦτα γὰρ ἐπέλεγον τοῖς θύμασιν, εὐφημίας <lb/>
            χάριν</foreign>. The attendant is pouring the wine <lb/>
            into the cup and the women are pressing <lb/>
            round to see. And one admires the <lb/>
            deep rich colour, and another the deli­ <lb/>
            cious fragrance (<foreign xml:lang="grc">προσόξει γ᾽ἡδὺ</foreign>), of the <lb/>
            Thasian wine, whilst a third would fain <lb/>
            be the first to pledge her oath, that is, to <lb/>
            raise the cup to her lips. The entire scene <lb/>
            is intended to banter the alleged wine­ <lb/>
            loving propensities of Athenian women.</p>
          <p>208. <foreign xml:lang="grc">λάχῃς</foreign>] Much of the humour <lb/>
            underlying this dialogue has passed un­ <lb/>
            noticed because annotators have failed <lb/>
            to observe that, in the peculiar form of <lb/>
            oath which Lysistrata is about to ad­ <lb/>
            minister, to swear has much the same <lb/>
            meaning as to drink. Myrrhina's eager­ <lb/>
            ness <foreign xml:lang="grc">πρώτην ὀμνύναι</foreign> arises from the cir­ <lb/>
            cumstance that she would so obtain the <lb/>
            first draught of wine, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπεὶ ἡ ὀμνύουσα <lb/>
            πρώτη ἒμελλε</foreign> Kat <foreign xml:lang="grc">πρώτη πιεῖν</foreign>, as the <lb/>
            Scholiast says; whilst the retort <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐὰν <lb/>
            λάχῃς</foreign> is due to the fact that in ancient <pb n="29"/>

              elected by lot (Horace, Odes i. 4. 18, ii. <lb/>
              7. 25), but sometimes also the order in <lb/>
              which the cup was to pass from guest <lb/>
              to guest was regulated in a similar <lb/>
              manner; huic si sorte bibas, sortem con­ <lb/>

            very dissimilar to one of our "graters," <lb/>
            being a sort of knife with a bronze or <lb/>
            ivory handle. And on the handles of <lb/>
            knives it was customary to carve all <lb/>
            sorts of animal figures. <foreign xml:lang="grc">τυρόκνηστις δὲ</foreign> <figure type="illustration">

              das. But bronze figures would be less <lb/>
              fragile, and in the British Museum there <lb/>
              are several specimens of Greek bronze <lb/>
              knife-handles on which the figures of <lb/>
              lions, hounds, and other animals are <lb/>
              carved in every variety of posture; some <lb/>
              indeed couching upon the handle, but <lb/>
              others standing upright, and touching <lb/>
              the handle only with their feet. And <lb/>
              it is plain that in the <foreign xml:lang="grc">τυρόκνηστις</foreign> of <lb/>
              which Lysistrata is speaking the lioness <lb/>
              was in a standing position. She takes <lb/>
              the lioness so standing as representing <lb/>
              a <foreign xml:lang="grc">σχῆμα συνουσίας</foreign>, the sentence being, <lb/>
              as Brunck observes, equivalent to <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐ <lb/>
              τετραποδηδὸν στήσομαι</foreign> (Peace 896). The <lb/>
              grammarians say that <foreign xml:lang="grc">τυρόκνηστις</foreign> was a <lb/>
              <foreign xml:lang="grc">σχῆμα συνουσίας</foreign>, but that seems to be <lb/>
              an entire mistake; the <foreign xml:lang="grc">λέαινα</foreign> was a <lb/>
              <foreign xml:lang="grc">σχῆμα συνουσίας</foreign>; see the lines of Machon <lb/>
              preserved by Athenaeus xiii, chap. 39 <lb/>
              (p. 577 D), but the addition <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπὶ</foreign> rvpo­ <lb/>
              <foreign xml:lang="grc">κνήστιδι</foreign> seems merely the product of <lb/>
              Lysistrata's too lively imagination.</p>

            may I drink of the Thasian wine; but if <lb/>
            I break my oath, may the cup be filled <lb/>
            with water instead. A person taking an <lb/>

              statement in Demosthenes contra Ti­ <lb/>
              mocr. 171 (p. 747) the dicastic oath was <lb/>

              complete and consummate a sacrifice, by <lb/>

              suming the remains of the Thasian wine, <lb/>
              a purpose intercepted by Calonice, who <lb/>

              on Plutus 345. Possibly also the lan­ <lb/>
              guage of Calonice is intended to convey <lb/>
              a hint that they will not long remain <lb/>

            tion of Isagoras, who invoked his aid <lb/>
            against the innovations of Cleisthenes. <lb/>
            On this occasion, though Cleisthenes him­ <lb/>
            self retired at his approach, yet when <lb/>
            he attempted to dissolve the Council, and <lb/>
            place the supreme power in the hands of <lb/>
            Isagoras and 300 of his partisans, the <lb/>
            Council and People made so determined a <lb/>
            resistance to his proposals, that he and <lb/>
            his adherents seized and took refuge <lb/>
            in the Acropolis. There he was besieged <lb/>
            with so much vigour that on the third day <lb/>
            he was forced to capitulate, and he and <lb/>
            his small Lacedaemonian force were <lb/>
            allowed to evacuate Attica. o <foreign xml:lang="grc">τε Κλεο</foreign>-</p><figure type="illustration">

            the Acropolis is a mere fancy picture, <lb/>

            is a very common term of abuse, and <lb/>
            is frequently found in these Comedies, <lb/>
            but the Chorus, having to do with women, <lb/>
            add " Euripides-detested," <foreign xml:lang="grc">μισογύνης γὰρ</foreign> <lb/>

            very early times grouped together as <lb/>
            one district under the name of (not <lb/>

            Acropolis. No other word can so well <lb/>
            express the character of the flat slope <lb/>

            approach to the citadel.”—Bp. Words­ <lb/>
            worth, Athens and Attica, chap. xiv. <lb/>
            The Scholiast seems to think that the <lb/>

            priated to this flat slope (<foreign xml:lang="grc">σιμὸν, ὄνομα <lb/>

            <foreign xml:lang="grc">πρόσαντες, ἢ ὄνομα χωρίου</foreign>; but it is in <lb/>
            fact freely used in reference to any <lb/>
            rising ground. Arrian, for example <lb/>
            (De Ven. 17), notices the well-known <lb/>
            fact that a hare gains an advantage <lb/>
            over its pursuers by taking to <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὰ σιμὰ <lb/>
            καὶτὰ ἀνώμαλα</foreign>,rising and uneven ground. <lb/>
            And so, in Alciphron's graphic descrip­ <lb/>
            tion of a coursing adventure (iii. 9), we <lb/>
            find the hare at once breasting and sur­ <lb/>

            or some such expression. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐξαμπρεύειν</foreign> <lb/>
            strictly means " to drag along with a <lb/>
            rope," but here it is used generally, <lb/>
            without reference to any particular <lb/>
            mode of carriage. The Men are still <lb/>

            But before they actually set fire to the <lb/>
            logs, they will make a strenuous rush <lb/>
            at the central door of the Propylaea and <lb/>
            try to burst it open, as if with a batter­ <lb/>

            of the Propylaea, and smother the de­ <lb/>

            they never actually reach the entrance. <lb/>
            Of course they could not, having to re­ <lb/>

            the Women's Chorus are heard in the <lb/>
            distance, though the singers themselves <lb/>
            are not yet visible. They have learned <lb/>
            that the Men are threatening to destroy <lb/>
            the Acropolis and its defenders in one <lb/>
            common conflagration, and have been <lb/>
            filling their pitchers at the fountain <lb/>
            for the purpose of extinguishing the <lb/>
            flame. They cannot yet see the Men, <lb/>

            The quicker movement of the Women is <lb/>
            indicated by the lighter and more trip­ <lb/>

            most idyllic character, of their entrance <lb/>

          <p>328. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀπὸ κρήνης</foreign>] Aristophanes is evi­ <lb/>
            dently depicting a scene of daily occur­ <lb/>
            rence at Athens, when the women came <lb/>
            in the dusk of the morning (<foreign xml:lang="grc">κνεφαία</foreign>) to <lb/>
            fill their pitchers at the fountain-head. <lb/>
            He must therefore be alluding to some <lb/>
            particular fountain, which Wordsworth <lb/>
            (Athens and Attica, chap. xii), Bothe, <lb/>
            Blaydes, and others suppose to have <lb/>
            been the Clepsydra, but which is by <lb/>
            Dyer (Ancient Athens, p. 445) and others <lb/>
            identified, no doubt correctly, with the <lb/>
            great reservoir known as the Ennea­ <lb/>
            crounos. For the Clepsydra was an in­ <lb/>
            termittent and comparatively small <lb/>
            spring of brackish water issuing from <lb/>
            the side of the Acropolis (see infra 913) <lb/>
            and somewhat difficult of access. It <lb/>
            could not have been the habitual resort <lb/>
            of women coming to draw water for <lb/>
            their daily necessities. But the Ennea­ <lb/>
            crounos was the great water-supply of <lb/>
            the district, and would naturally be <lb/>
            surrounded in the morning by a bustling <lb/>
            and excited throng. Its exact position is <lb/>
            a matter of dispute ; but we know from <lb/>
            Thucydides (ii. 15) that it was in the <lb/>
            immediate vicinity of the Acropolis, <lb/>
            which is sufficient for our present pur­ <lb/>
            pose. The historian tells us that its <lb/>
            water was specially used <foreign xml:lang="grc">πρὸ γαμικῶν</foreign> <lb/>
            (cf. Pollux iii. 43); and it is to this <lb/>
            circumstance that the Chorus are sup­ <lb/>
            posed to allude when they threaten the <lb/>
            men (infra 378) with a <foreign xml:lang="grc">λουτρὸν νυμφικόν</foreign>. <lb/>
            It must be remembered that although <lb/>
            the Chorus originally seized the Acro­ <lb/>
            polis (supra 179, 241), yet throughout <lb/>
            all the subsequent action of the Play <lb/>
            they are always in the lower City, and <lb/>
            never inside the Acropolis.</p>

            The name <foreign xml:lang="grc">Πολιοῦχος</foreign> is equivalent to the <lb/>

            caricaturing, in some of their works, <lb/>
            his own repulsive physiognomy. For <lb/>
            as Pliny says, xxxvi. 4 (2) (I quote from <lb/>

            had a passing foule and ill-favoured face <lb/>

            companions, sharpened his style or pen <lb/>
            against them, and so coursed them with <lb/>
            bitter rimes and biting libels that as <lb/>

              namely in Delos ; under which pieces <lb/>
              of their worke they subscribed certain <lb/>

          <p>362. <foreign xml:lang="grc">καὶ μὴν ἰδού</foreign>] This is a defiance; <lb/>
            an invitation to the opponent to " come <lb/>
            on," she is ready for him. Cf. Thesm. <lb/>
            568. By <foreign xml:lang="grc">παρέξω</foreign> she means I will offer <lb/>
            my cheek to your blow ; I won't withdraw <lb/>
            myself; you may strike me if you like. <lb/>
            But if you do, she adds in a fury, " nun­ <lb/>

            ore testiculos; nam ego, ut canis, prius <lb/>

            words of the speech are uttered <foreign xml:lang="grc">παρὰ <lb/>

            pomegranate," <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἡ μεταφορὰ ἀπὸ τω̑ν ῥοιω̑ν</foreign>, <lb/>
            as the Scholiast says. Thence it comes <lb/>
            to mean generally to rifle, to empty, and <lb/>
            so to destroy, to smash, as here. We meet <lb/>
            with the word again infra 448, Ach. <lb/>
            1179, Peace 63. The words <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸ γη̑ράς σου</foreign> <lb/>
            are merely a periphrasis for "you." <lb/>
            He is addressing Stratyllis, the leader, <lb/>
            and apparently the oldest member, of <lb/>
            the Women's Chorus who were all <lb/>
            elderly women. See the Commentary <lb/>
            on 179 supra. The line which follows <lb/>
            is of course spoken by another member <lb/>

            this phrase is found not in the Plays of <lb/>
            Euripides (or, at least not in any of his <lb/>
            extant Plays), but in the Electra of <lb/>
            Sophocles where (line 622) Clytaem­ <lb/>
            nestra addresses it to her daughter. <lb/>
            But the idea contained in the phrase is <lb/>
            thoroughly Euripidean, and possibly <lb/>
            the words themselves may have oc­ <lb/>
            curred in one of his non - existent <lb/>
            Tragedies.</p>
          <p>370. <foreign xml:lang="grc">αἰρώμεθ</foreign>’] Taken aback by the des­ <lb/>
            perate language of the women, the Men <lb/>
            for the moment relinquish the idea of <lb/>
            assaulting Stratyllis and her comrades, <lb/>
            and turn their attention to the fire. <lb/>
            The women therefore again take up the <lb/>
            ewers they had set down, supra 358, in <lb/>
            anticipation of an immediate attack. <lb/>
            But their action has reminded the men <lb/>
            of the water which the women are <lb/>
            carrying, and a new altercation breaks <lb/>
            out on this subject which speedily brings <lb/>
            matters to a crisis. The reader will ob­ <lb/>
            serve the greater rapidity of the present <lb/>
            squabble. The speeches are never more <lb/>
            than a line long, and are often only <lb/>
            half that length.</p>
          <p>372. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὦ τύμβε</foreign>] We have seen that the <lb/>
            Coryphaeus of the Men's Chorus was <lb/>
            impolite enough to taunt Stratyllis with <lb/>
            her age. But the Men are no younger <lb/>
            than the Women, and now Stratyllis <lb/>
            returns the taunt by calling her oppo­ <lb/>
            nent a <foreign xml:lang="grc">τύμβος</foreign>, a mocking appellation of <lb/>
            an old man. Euripides makes Creon <lb/>
            call himself (Medea 1209), and the <lb/>
            Argive herald call Iolaus (Heracleidae <lb/>
            167), a <foreign xml:lang="grc">γέροντα τύμβον</foreign>.</p>

            says the Scholiast. If the Men have <lb/>
            the soap, the Women have the water <lb/>
            wherewith to give them a bath. And <lb/>
            that too a <foreign xml:lang="grc">λουτρὸν νυμφικὸν</foreign>, they add ; <lb/>
            a phrase supposed to imply that the <lb/>
            water had been drawn, as no doubt it <lb/>
            had been, from the Enneacrounos. See <lb/>
            the Commentary on 328 supra. Pollux <lb/>
            (iii. 43) after observing that the water <lb/>
            for the wedding bath was at Athens <lb/>
            drawn from the Enneacrounos, but in <lb/>

            Adonis, the Adonis-dirge. The <foreign xml:lang="grc">Ἀδώνια</foreign> <lb/>
            (Peace 420) was celebrated only by <lb/>
            women, and lasted for two days; one <lb/>
            day commemorating the happy wedded <lb/>
            love of Adonis and Aphrodite; the <lb/>
            other, her mourning over his untimely <lb/>
            death. The ceremonies are graphically <lb/>
            and learnedly described by Thomas <lb/>
            Stanley in his " Excitations on Bion ” <lb/>
            (published 1651, reprinted in 1821); <lb/>
            and probably the best idea of the <lb/>
            Adonis-dirge is to be derived from Bion's <lb/>
            Idyll, written more than a century after <lb/>
            the exhibition of this Play ; a beautiful <lb/>
            presentation of which by the Hon. E. J. <lb/>
            Cardew will be found at the close of <lb/>
            this Commentary. The manner in which <lb/>
            the women wailed for Adonis is shown <lb/>
            by Lucian, De Syria Dea G. That these <lb/>
            ill-omened dirges and lamentations did <lb/>
            really attend the dispatch of the, fleet <lb/>
            to Sicily we are told by Plutarch <lb/>
            (Nicias 13, Alcibiades 18). Demostratus, <lb/>
            he says, proposed that the generals <lb/>
            should have absolute discretion as to <lb/>
            the preparations for the expedition and <lb/>
            as to the whole conduct of the War. <lb/>
            And when the people so voted and all <lb/>
            things were now ready, many ill omens <lb/>
            occurred. For the women were holding <lb/>
            the Adonia, and everywhere about the <lb/>
            City mimic funerals of Adonis were <lb/>
            going on, and the dirges of weeping <lb/>
            women. And not a few thought that <lb/>
            these things were a presage of the fate of <lb/>
            the expedition which was then setting <lb/>
            forth with such splendid promise and <lb/>
            vigour. And again in Nicias 12 he men­ <lb/>
            tions Demostratus as the demagogue <lb/>
            most eager for the war. Adonis was the <lb/>
            Phoenician Thammuz, and his worship <lb/>
            was one of the idolatries into which the <pb n="48"/>

              <graphic url="ENG_BELL_07_fig112.jpg"/></figure> <lb/>
              Israelites were so prone to fall. See <lb/>
              Baring Gould's " Curious Myths " under <lb/>
              the title " St. George." These acts of <lb/>
              worship were commonly performed on <lb/>
              the flat tops of the houses. See Jere­ <lb/>
              miah xix. I'a, xxxii. 29, and Zepha­ <lb/>
              niah i. 5. "They worshipped on the <lb/>
              house-tops," says Dr. Pusey on the last- <lb/>
              mentioned passage, " probably to have <lb/>
              a clear view of that magnificent ex­ <lb/>
              panse of sky, the moon and stars which <lb/>
              God had ordained; the queen of heaven <lb/>
              which they worshipped instead of Him­ <lb/>
              self." Moreover, the house-top was <lb/>
              the recognized place for wailing and <lb/>
              lamentation. See Isaiah xv. 3, xxii. 1, <lb/>
              and Jeremiah xlviii. 38.</p>
          <p>391. <foreign xml:lang="grc">μὴ</foreign>] <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὥρασι</foreign>] bad luck to him, a <lb/>
            parenthetical imprecation. The full <lb/>
            phrase, as Bergler remarks, is <foreign xml:lang="grc">μὴ ὥρασιν <lb/>
            ἵκοιτο</foreign>. See infra 1037. Athenaeus ii. <lb/>
            45 cites some lines from Alexis where <lb/>
            a speaker says III fare the man who ate <lb/>
            the lupines (<foreign xml:lang="grc">μὴ ὥρασιν ... ἵκοιθ</foreign>’ o <foreign xml:lang="grc">τοὺς <lb/>
            θέρμους φαγὼν</foreign>) and threw down the husks <lb/>
            in the porch. 'Twas not Cleaenetus the <lb/>
            Tragic poet, of that I am sure, for he <lb/>
            would have eaten husks and all. In his <lb/>
            note on that passage Casaubon refers <lb/>
            to three places in Lucian in which <lb/>
            the phrase occurs, two of which I had <lb/>
            myself marked for quotation. In the <lb/>
            sixth Dialogue of the Gods, Hera re­ <lb/>
            ferring to Ixion's passion for herself <lb/>
            exclaims <foreign xml:lang="grc">μὴ ὥρασιν ἵκοιτοτω̑ν ὺπὲρ αὺτὸν <lb/>
            ἐπιθυμω̑ν</foreign>, A murrain on the fellow, de­ <lb/>
            siring what is far above him. In the De <lb/>
            Saltatione, 5, Craton says Hang me if I <lb/>
            would stand that, <foreign xml:lang="grc">μὴ ὥρασιν ἄρα ἱκοίμην, εἴ <lb/>
            τι τοιου̑τον ἀνασχοίμην ποτέ</foreign>. And in the <lb/>
            tenth Courtesan-Dialogue a girl says of <lb/>
            a philosopher who is weaning her lover <lb/>
            from her, <foreign xml:lang="grc">μὴ ὥρασιν ἵ κοιτ</foreign>’<foreign xml:lang="grc">ὸ λη̑ροςἐκε</foreign>ȋ<foreign xml:lang="grc">νος <lb/>
            τοιαυ̑τα παιδεύων τὸ μειράκιον</foreign>. The literal <lb/>
            meaning of the phrase seems to be may <lb/>
            he come in a bad time (not in season), <lb/>
            and so, may he come to bad luck. A simi­ <lb/>
            lar idea finds expression in many modern <lb/>
            languages. Andad con Di6s y mucho de <lb/>
            enhoramala says Sancho the governor <lb/>
            to the detected virago in Don Quixote, <lb/>
            Part II, chap. 45. This was no doubt <lb/>
            the original form of the phrase, though <lb/>

              Acropolis to obtain the money to pay <lb/>
              for them. For the money, as we know, <lb/>
              was in the public treasury <foreign xml:lang="grc">παρὰ τῇ θεῷ</foreign>, <lb/>
              in the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὀπισθόδομος</foreign> of Athene's Temple ; <lb/>
              that is, according to the Scholiast on <lb/>
              Plutus 1193, in the Erechtheium (which <lb/>
              would seem, a priori, the most probable <lb/>

              scholars, the Parthenon; see the Com­ <lb/>
              mentary on the Plutus. And one of the <lb/>
              reasons for which the women had seized <lb/>

              ployment of the money for the pro­ <lb/>

              when the <foreign xml:lang="grc">Πρόβουλος</foreign> would go to the <lb/>
              Treasury, he finds himself, to his sur­ <lb/>

              action of the women. It was always a <lb/>

              nians to obtain a sufficient supply of <lb/>
              timber for their shipbuilding purposes ; <lb/>
              and one of the objects which they hoped <lb/>
              to secure by extending their dominion <lb/>
              over Sicily and Magna Graecia was a <lb/>
              never-failing supply of timber from the <lb/>
              forests of Italy. And Andocides, in his <lb/>
              speech "De Reditu suo" 11, declares <lb/>
              that in the year 411, the very year in <lb/>
              which this Comedy was acted, he was <lb/>
              bringing for the use of the armament at <lb/>
              Samos a cargo of cheap oar-spars, <foreign xml:lang="grc">κωπέας</foreign>, <lb/>

            who seized the Acropolis, and who now <lb/>
            form the Chorus of Women; they are <lb/>
            the young matrons who entered into the <lb/>
            Acropolis with Lysistrata, supra 244-6. <lb/>
            The Probulus is not minded to stand <lb/>
            any nonsense from these recalcitrant <lb/>
            women. He at once directs an archer <lb/>
            to arrest Lysistrata and to tie her hands <lb/>

            the note to Thesm. 517 that Artemis <lb/>
            was one of the divinities most commonly <lb/>
            invoked by Athenian women. It will be <lb/>
            observed that these four little defiant <lb/>
            speeches by women all commence with <lb/>
            a similar adjuration ; <foreign xml:lang="grc">εἴ τἄρα</foreign> 111) TT] II " Apn- <lb/>

              expressly refers to Artemis as <foreign xml:lang="grc">Τῇ φωσφό­ <lb/>
              ρῳ θεᾷ</foreign>; just as Athene, at the end of <lb/>
              the same play, 1456, prophecies"<foreign xml:lang="grc">Αρτεμιν <lb/>

              with in a subsequent note. But allow­ <lb/>
              ing that the selfsame Goddess is invoked <lb/>
              in all the four speeches, who are the <lb/>
              speakers that invoke her ? The Ravenna <lb/>
              MS. gives the first speech to Lysistrata, <lb/>
              and the remaining three to Stratyllis. <lb/>
              This arrangement prevailed in all the <lb/>
              editions before Portus, who assigned them <lb/>
              to Lysistrata and Stratyllis alternately, <lb/>
              and so all subsequent editions until <lb/>
              after Dindorf. But Dobree pointed out <lb/>
              that there are certainly four Scythians <lb/>
              and four speakers; and this view was <lb/>
              approved by Dindorf in his notes, and <lb/>
              is generally adopted by later editors. <pb n="54"/>
              <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BELL_07_fig124.jpg"/></figure> <lb/>
              Dindorf suggested that the four <lb/>
              speeches should be ascribed to <foreign xml:lang="grc">Λυσιστράτη</foreign> <lb/>
              and <foreign xml:lang="grc">Γυναῖκες</foreign> 1, 2, 3 ; and this has been <lb/>
              done by all editors who have adopted Do­ <lb/>
              bree's view excepting Van Leeuwen, who <lb/>
              thinks fit to call the last three speakers <lb/>
              <foreign xml:lang="grc">Γρᾶες</foreign> 1, 2, 3 ; not having, it would seem, <lb/>
              observed that all the elderly women <lb/>
              are in the orchestra with Stratyllis, and <lb/>
              that Lysistrata's comrades now issuing <lb/>
              from the Acropolis on to the stage are all <lb/>
              youthful matrons who could not by any <lb/>
              conceivable stretch of language be called <lb/>
              <foreign xml:lang="grc">γρᾶες</foreign>. Dobree suggested that one of <lb/>
              the women might be Myrrhina, and <lb/>
              Bergk that another might be Calonice ; <lb/>
              and in my translation, published in 1878, <lb/>
              I called the three women Calonice, <lb/>
              Myrrhina, and Stratyllis. This arrange­ <lb/>
              ment I have retained in the text, for it <lb/>
              seems absurd to suppose that Calonice <lb/>
              and Myrrhina who were Lysistrata's <lb/>
              chief friends and adherents in starting <lb/>
              the revolution should not be standing by <lb/>
              her at this critical moment. My only <lb/>
              doubt has been about the name of <lb/>
              Stratyllis, who was the leader of the <lb/>
              Women's Chorus and whose speeches <lb/>
              should therefore, according to the <lb/>
              arrangement adopted in this edition, be <lb/>
              attributed to the <foreign xml:lang="grc">χορὸς γυναικῶν</foreign>. But <lb/>
              the use of her name as a dramatis per­ <lb/>
              sona is so persistently supported by the <lb/>
              MSS. that I cannot but retain it. And <lb/>
              possibly, not being the real Coryphaeus <lb/>
              of the Play, she may be allowed a <lb/>
              greater individuality. See Professor <lb/>
              John Williams White's article in the <lb/>
              " Harvard Studies in Classical Philology," <lb/>
              xvii. 103 on " An unrecognized actor in <lb/>
              Greek Comedy."</p>
          <p>436. <foreign xml:lang="grc">δημόσιος</foreign>] a mere public servant, <lb/>
            "publicus minister," as Bergler and <lb/>
            Enger rightly interpret it. Brunck's <lb/>
            notion that <foreign xml:lang="grc">δημόισιος</foreign>, both here and in <lb/>
            Knights 1135, signifies a victim set apart <lb/>
            for public sacrifice, and so is equivalent, <lb/>
            as a term of abuse, to <foreign xml:lang="grc">κ</foreign>á<foreign xml:lang="grc">θαρμα</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">φαρ­ <lb/>

            defies the archer first told off to arrest <lb/>
            her, the <foreign xml:lang="grc">Πρόβουλος</foreign> calls for a second to <lb/>

            Thesm. 533 and the Commentary there), <lb/>
            still nothing can be more natural than <lb/>
            that these defenders of the Acropolis <lb/>
            should be found invoking Pandrosus, <lb/>
            whose shrine was in the Erechtheium, <pb n="55"/>

              And yet, since in every other speech <lb/>
              throughout this short altercation the <lb/>
              Women invoke Artemis in one or other <lb/>
              of her characters, I cannot but believe <lb/>
              that in this invocation also the name of <lb/>
              <foreign xml:lang="grc">Π</foreign>á<foreign xml:lang="grc">νδροσος</foreign>, the All-bedewer, is intended <lb/>
              to apply to Artemis as identical with <lb/>
              Hecate or the Moon. See on 435 supra. <lb/>
              That dew falls mostly under a cloud­ <lb/>
              less sky was a fact well known to the <lb/>

            skirmishes (1) between the Men and <lb/>
            Women Choruses, and (2) between the <lb/>
            Magistrate and the garrison of the <lb/>
            Acropolis are now concluded, and the <lb/>
            parties settle down to one of those full­ <lb/>
            dress debates in anapaestic tetrameters <lb/>
            which, whenever they occur, form the <lb/>
            most picturesque, as well as the most <lb/>
            illuminating, portion of the Play. In <lb/>
            them we are sure to find the real intent <lb/>
            and purpose of the drama set forth in a <lb/>
            lucid and vigorous argument, with little <lb/>
            or no attempt at comic caricature. The <lb/>
            little song with which the Chorus of <lb/>
            Men commence the debate, the anti­ <lb/>
            strophe to which, sung by the Chorus of <lb/>
            Women, will be found infra 541-8, is <lb/>
            composed of seven lines ; two cretico- <lb/>
            paeonic (the first of the two having <lb/>
            a monosyllabic base); and five anapaes­ <lb/>
            tic, four consisting of three anapaests <lb/>
            each, and the last of two anapaests. <lb/>
            The long syllable of the anapaest is <lb/>
            frequently resolved into two short ones ; <lb/>
            so that in lieu of the ordinary anapaest <lb/>
            we have one in four short syllables.</p>
          <p>481. <foreign xml:lang="grc">Κραναάν</foreign>] In the time of the <lb/>
            Pelasgians, Herodotus tells us, the <lb/>
            Athenians went by the name of <foreign xml:lang="grc">Κραναοί</foreign> ; <lb/>
            afterwards, in the time of Cecrops, they <lb/>
            received the further name of <foreign xml:lang="grc">Κεκροπίδαι</foreign> <lb/>
            (Knights 1055); and it was not until the <lb/>
            time of Erechtheus that they took the <lb/>
            name of ’<foreign xml:lang="grc">Αθηναῖοι</foreign>, Hdt. viii. 44. The an­ <lb/>
            tique flavour of the name " Cranaan " <lb/>
            appealed strongly to the Athenians, who <lb/>
            always prided themselves on their <lb/>
            antiquity. Pindar thrice uses the words <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">Κρανααῖς ἐν</foreign> ’<foreign xml:lang="grc">Αθάναις</foreign>, Olympic vii, xiii ; <lb/>
            Nemea viii. Aristophanes speaks of <foreign xml:lang="grc">τῶν</foreign> <lb/>

            especially was the epithet applicable, <lb/>
            as it is here applied, to the Acropolis, <lb/>
            the oldest inhabited part of Athens, and <lb/>
            probably the only inhabited part in <lb/>

            Acropolis was a sacred enclosure, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὅλης <lb/>

            Demosthenes, tie F. L. 309 (p. 428). See <lb/>
            the Commentary on 345 supra. The term <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">τέμενος</foreign> included not only the Temple <lb/>
            itself, but all the courts and sacred pre­ <lb/>
            cincts belonging to it. The words <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἄβατον ἱερὸν</foreign> are in Plato's Laches, chap. <lb/>
            6 (p. 183 B) employed with regard to <lb/>
            Lacedaemon. " I observe the hoplites," <lb/>

            <foreign xml:lang="grc">κωδωνίζω</foreign> comes to bear that signification <lb/>
            is not quite certain. The old gramma­ <lb/>
            rians refer it either to the custom of the <lb/>
            night-watch ringing bells as they went <lb/>
            their rounds for the purpose of ascer­ <lb/>
            taining whether the sentries were awake, <lb/>
            or elsetothe practice of testing the nerves <lb/>
            of horses, or of quails, by the sudden ring­ <lb/>
            ing of bells. The Scholiast says <foreign xml:lang="grc">μετῆκται</foreign> <figure type="illustration">

              participle <foreign xml:lang="grc">μεθέντας</foreign> at the end of the <lb/>

              used intransitively, slackening in our <lb/>
              efforts, " nostra negligentia " as Brunck <lb/>
              translates it.</p>
          <p>487. <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὴν πόλιν</foreign>] that is, as the Scholiast <lb/>
            observes, <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὴν ἀκρόπολιν</foreign>. It is in fact the <lb/>
            word which Aristophanes almost invari­ <lb/>

              which the actual term <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀκρόπολις</foreign> is found, <lb/>

              to the Magistrate's question Lysistrata <lb/>
              avers that they had seized the Acropolis <lb/>
              for the purpose of keeping the money <lb/>
              safe, and so stopping the supplies for <lb/>
              the War. This was their avowed object, <lb/>
              supra 173-80.</p>

            Peace 394 and the note there. The <lb/>
            Scholiast on the Peace says of him <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὗτος φιλοπόλεμος ἦν, καὶ πολεμοποιὸς <lb/>
            κερδῶν ἰδίων ἕνεκεν</foreign>. A turbulent and <lb/>

            tablishing the rule of the Four Hundred <lb/>
            in its place. The Scholiast observes <lb/>
            that Aristophanes had spoken of him <lb/>
            much in the same way, fifteen years be­ <lb/>
            fore, in his comedy of the Babylonians ; <lb/>

              justified in saying that the money was <lb/>

              particular crisis, Thuc. viii. 1. 15. But <lb/>
              Lysistrata puts aside that question by <lb/>
              raising a preliminary objection. The <lb/>
              question whether the money is, or is not, <lb/>
              necessary for the war is, she says, quite <lb/>

            the Commentary on Wasps 416.</p>

            "First Woman," I have assigned to old <lb/>
            Stratyllis, the leader of the Women's <lb/>

            the dialogue carried on by the actors on <lb/>
            the stage (supra 447, see the Commentary <lb/>
            on 435 and 445 supra), and seems <lb/>
            generally anxious to have a finger in <lb/>
            the pie. But the Magistrate declines to <lb/>
            recognize the old hag in the orchestra ; <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὦ γραῦ</foreign> as be politely calls her. He waves <lb/>
            her aside with a jibe on her age, and <lb/>

              her own fate. And turning to Lysistrata, <lb/>
              he bids her answer the question he put <lb/>
              four lines above, viz. what had in­ <lb/>
              duced the women to intermeddle with <lb/>
              questions of Peace and War. This <lb/>
              Lysistrata proceeds to tell him.</p>
          <p>507. TOV <foreign xml:lang="grc">μὲν προτέρου πολέμου κατά</foreign>] I <lb/>
            have ventured to substitute these words <lb/>
            for the common reading <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸν μὲν πρότερον <lb/>
            πόλεμον καὶ</foreign>, which makes no sense at all. <lb/>
            The substituted words are very inelegant, <lb/>
            and veryunlike what Aristophanes would <lb/>
            have written, but I think that they give <lb/>
            the meaning which Aristophanes in­ <lb/>
            tended to convey, viz. in the time of <lb/>
            theformer tear: that is of the so-called <lb/>
            Archidamian War, which commenced <lb/>
            with the first invasion of Attica under <lb/>
            King Archidamus, and was terminated <lb/>
            by the Peace of Nicias.</p>

              fully they were preserved may be judged <lb/>
              by the statement of Pausanias, writing <lb/>
              600 years afterwards, that he had seen <lb/>
              at Olympia the bronze pillar containing <lb/>
              the terms of the 30 years' truce made <lb/>
              in 455 B. c. between the Lacedaemonians <lb/>
              and the Athenians (Thuc. i. 115) and <lb/>
              also the pillar containing the terms of <lb/>
              the 100 years' treaty made in 420 B.C. <lb/>
              between Athens, Argos, Mantinea, and <lb/>
              Elis (Thuc. v. 47), Pausanias v. 12. 7 <lb/>
              and 23. 3. But in the present passage <lb/>
              we are dealing with the pillar containing <lb/>
              the Peace of Nicias which, as we know <lb/>
              (Thuc. v. 18), was to be erected in the <lb/>
              Acropolis of Athens. Some three years <lb/>
              later Alcibiades persuaded the Athe­ <lb/>

              the Treaty, that the Lacedaemonians <lb/>

            where see the Commentary. That the <lb/>

            the speech which accompanies it. <foreign xml:lang="grc">στή­ <lb/>

              return. The Athenians had lost in Sicily <lb/>
              not only their fleets and armies, but also <lb/>
              their most trusted leaders; and the <lb/>
              people, disheartened and bewildered, <lb/>

              man who, whether acting for or against <lb/>
              his country, bad proved himself beyond <lb/>
              all comparison the most brilliant and <lb/>

              and all went well. They distrusted him, <lb/>
              and dispensed with his services, and <lb/>
              Athens was ruined.</p>
          <p>527, 528. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀντακροᾶσθαι κἀντισιωπᾶν</foreign>] To <lb/>

            had hitherto done. In the next line <lb/>
            Lysistrata is putting her plan into <lb/>
            operation. The Magistrate, interrupt­ <lb/>

              supra 515.</p>
          <p>530. <foreign xml:lang="grc">κάλυμμα</foreign>] A covering for the head, <lb/>
            a veil enveloping the head and face ; <lb/>
            sometimes used of a bride's wedding-veil, <lb/>
            Aesch. Ag. 1149, Eur. Iph. Taur. 372; <lb/>
            sometimes of a mourner's veil. But <lb/>
            it was not confined to those classes. <lb/>
            Lysistrata, who is neither a bride nor <lb/>
            a mourner, is wearing one now ; and the <lb/>
            Magistrate's allusion to it as a distinc­ <lb/>
            tive article of womanly attire has a <lb/>
            result he little expected. It gives <lb/>
            Lysistrata an idea which she and her <lb/>
            comrades immediately carry out. The <lb/>
            Man, we have seen, is now to take the <lb/>
            Woman's place ; and it is he therefore <lb/>
            whose duty it is to wear the <foreign xml:lang="grc">κάλυμμα</foreign> <lb/>
            and spin the thread, <foreign xml:lang="grc">στήμονα νεῖν</foreign>. At <lb/>
            once, therefore, they array the surprised <lb/>
            Magistrate in this womanly veil, and <lb/>
            supply him with the basket and require­ <lb/>
            ments of a spinning-woman. With <foreign xml:lang="grc">σοί <lb/>

          <p>535. <foreign xml:lang="grc">καλαθίσκον</foreign>] This was a woman's <lb/>
            wicker work-basket in which the wool <lb/>
            was placed ready for the spinner. Catul­ <lb/>
            lus (lxiv. 319), describing the Parcae at <lb/>
            work, says <lb/>
            Ante pedes autem candentis mollia lanae <lb/>
            Vellera virgati custodibant calathisci. <lb/>
            And the wool, taken out by the spinner, <lb/>
            was carded back into the basket; cf. <lb/>
            infra 579. We may be sure, both from <lb/>
            the grammatical requirements of the <lb/>
            present passage and from the analogy <lb/>
            of the corresponding system of dimeters <lb/>
            infra 603, 604, that this line is spoken <lb/>
            by one of Lysistrata's friends (I think, <lb/>
            Myrrhina), and that a line before it, <lb/>
            spoken by another of her friends (Calo­ <lb/>
            nice), has dropped out of the text. For <lb/>
            the missing line Enger suggests <foreign xml:lang="grc">καὶ <lb/>

          <p>537. <foreign xml:lang="grc">κυάμους τρώγων</foreign>] Women were in <lb/>
            the habit of chewing some eatable as <lb/>
            they wove or spun. Bergler quotes from <lb/>

            τρώγουσα, γύναι, τὴν χλαῖναν ὔΦαινε</foreign>. And <lb/>
            Lysistrata selects <foreign xml:lang="grc">κυάμους</foreign> as the special <lb/>
            vegetable for the Magistrate to chew, <lb/>
            because, being an Athenian citizen, he <lb/>
            is presumably a <foreign xml:lang="grc">κυαμοτρὼξ</foreign> (Knights 41, <lb/>
            infra 690), a bean-consumer, that is to say, <lb/>
            very fond of the bean, not indeed as an <lb/>
            article of food, but as the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ψῆφος</foreign> with <lb/>
            which Athenians voted in their popular <lb/>
            elections.</p>
          <p>538. <foreign xml:lang="grc">πόλεμος δὲ γυναιξι μελήσει</foreign>] She is <lb/>
            again referring to Hector's speech, as <lb/>
            supra 520; but with Hector the wife <lb/>
            was to go to the loom, while " War was <lb/>
            the care and the business of Men" ; <lb/>
            whereas here the Man is to go to the <lb/>
            loom, and “War is the care and the <lb/>
            business of Women.”</p>
          <p>541. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἔγωγε</foreign>] The first debate is inau­ <lb/>
            gurated (supra 476-83) by a song of <lb/>
            encouragement addressed by the Chorus <lb/>
            of Men to the Magistrate ; the second <lb/>
            by a similar song addressed by the <lb/>
            Chorus of Women to Lysistrata and <lb/>
            her friends. The old Women in the <lb/>
            orchestra are full of enthusiasm for the <lb/>
            young Women on the stage; for their <lb/>
            native grace, their courage, their bright <lb/>
            wit, and their wise patriotism. There <lb/>
            is nothing that they are not prepared <lb/>
            to do for Lysistrata's sake; but un­ <lb/>
            fortunately, owing to their respective <lb/>
            positions in the orchestra and on the <lb/>
            stage, there is nothing that they can <lb/>
            at the present moment do but dance; <lb/>
            and this, they protest, they will never <lb/>

              absurd one, since (apart from the plural <lb/>

              and lovely Lysistrata could not possibly <lb/>
              have been addressed as manliest ofgrand­ <lb/>

            sideration of the political situation at <lb/>

            pound her views (that is to say, the <lb/>
            views of Aristophanes) as to the right <lb/>
            mode of arranging the internal politics <lb/>
            of Athens. And here, as everywhere <lb/>
            in these Comedies, there is an entire <lb/>
            absence of political partisanship ; there <lb/>
            is merely a design of blending together <lb/>
            all classes of the community in a bond <lb/>
            of peace, unity, and concord; a happy <lb/>
            condition, partially achieved for a brief <lb/>
            period in the course of this very year, <lb/>
            411 B.C., when that <foreign xml:lang="grc">μετρία ἐς τοὺς ὀλιγους</foreign> <lb/>

            Thucydides stamps with his emphatic <lb/>
            approval. And just as in preparing the <lb/>
            wool the first step is thoroughly to wash <lb/>
            the fleece in the washing-tub, so the <lb/>
            first step in the renovation of the State <lb/>
            is to purify it from all that is corrupt <lb/>
            and offensive, so that the official wheels <lb/>
            (to vary the metaphor) may work in a <lb/>
            clean and, wholesome manner, unclog­ <lb/>

            we must understand <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐκπλύνομενι</foreign>n a sense <lb/>
            somewhat different from that which it <lb/>
            bears in the following line ; since here, <lb/>
            as in Plutus 1062, it means to wash <lb/>
            thoroughly, while there, as in Plato's <lb/>
            Republic iv. 7 (p. 430 A), it means to wash <lb/>
            out a stain or the like.</p>

            matted clots in the wool, which would <lb/>
            render it useless for the wool-spinner. <lb/>
            Analogous to these in the body politic <lb/>
            are the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ξυνωμοσίαι έπὶ δίκας καὶ ἀρχῖς</foreign> <lb/>
            (Thuc. viii. 54), the political clubs and <lb/>
            caucuses banded together to obtain <lb/>
            verdicts in the dicasteries and offices <lb/>
            in the State for themselves and their <lb/>
            partisans. These caucuses were at the <lb/>
            present moment particularly active. <lb/>

            set class against class, his own dearest <lb/>
            wish being to blend all classes together <lb/>
            into one harmonious whole. These clots <lb/>

              But in fact the citizens, one and all, <lb/>
              <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἃπαντες</foreign>, are to form the staple; the <lb/>
              other ingredients are merely to be <lb/>
              mingled with the citizens. It will be <lb/>
              remembered that a debtor to the trea­ <lb/>
              sury lost all the privileges of a citizen : <lb/>
              he was disfranchised, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἃτίμς</foreign>. But Lysis­ <lb/>
              trata will have no citizen disfranchised <lb/>
              on a plea of this kind. Here, as more <lb/>

            raiment, and placed him on a bed with <lb/>
            his feet towards the door. See Eccl. <lb/>
            537 and the note there. Lysistrata <lb/>
            pretends to believe that this is why he is <lb/>

            the omission, assures her victim that <lb/>
            the other funeral ceremonies shall at all <lb/>
            events be duly performed. The chief of <lb/>

            the estate of Menecles," 46, the speaker, <lb/>
            in proof of his contention that he was <lb/>
            the adopted son and recognized succes­ <lb/>

            draw into the Acropolis, and the stage <lb/>
            is left empty. The two hostile Semi­ <lb/>
            choruses, the Chorus of Men and the <lb/>
            Chorus of Women, remain face to face <lb/>
            in the orchestra, and resume the mutual <lb/>
            recriminations which were interrupted <lb/>
            by the entrance of the Probulus, supra <lb/>

            which follow commences with a mixture <lb/>
            of trochaic and cretico-paeonic lines, <lb/>

              The Mystery-maidens as we have seen <lb/>
              were little girls between seven and <lb/>
              eleven. The Mill-maidens are rather <lb/>
              older; damsels ten years old and up­ <lb/>
              wards. For we may assume that when <lb/>
              the speaker says that at ten years of age <lb/>
              she became a Mill-maiden she means <lb/>
              that she attained that distinction at the <lb/>
              earliest possible age. But whom are we <lb/>
              to understand by the words <foreign xml:lang="grc">τάρχηγέτι</foreign> ? <lb/>
              The Scholiast, after explaining that the <lb/>
              words are equivalent to <foreign xml:lang="grc">τῇ δεσποίνῃ</foreign> the <lb/>
              Sovereign Lady, refers them to either <lb/>
              Artemis or Demeter; while Tyrwhitt <lb/>
              calls attention to the statement in <lb/>

              <graphic url="ENG_BELL_07_fig174.jpg"/></figure> <lb/>
              Artemis which fell down from heaven <lb/>
              into the Tauric Temple where, after­ <lb/>
              wards, Iphigeneia was priestess, and <lb/>
              whence she brought it on her return to <lb/>
              Hellas. She continued, it was believed, <lb/>
              to be its custodian at Brauron to the <lb/>
              end of her life ; and the bear was so in­ <lb/>
              timately, and so mysteriously, connected <lb/>
              with the worship of the Brauronian <lb/>
              Artemis that some supposed Brauron, <lb/>
              and not Aulis, to have been the scene of <lb/>
              the attempted sacrifice of Iphigeneia, <lb/>
              and the victim substituted in her stead <lb/>
              by Artemis to have been not a deer, but <lb/>
              a bear. A tame bear belonging to the <lb/>
              sanctuary was killed by some Athenian <lb/>
              lads, and the wrath of Artemis at the <lb/>
              sacrilegious act could be appeased only <lb/>
              by a regulation that every Athenian <lb/>
              maiden should before her marriage be <lb/>
              required " to play the bear" (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀρκτεύειν</foreign>), <lb/>
              that is, to dress up as a bear, and in that <lb/>
              guise take part in the Temple service. <lb/>
              She wore on that occasion a yellow robe <lb/>
              (<foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸν κροκωτὸν</foreign>) assimilated to the colour <lb/>
              of a bearskin. But this, though doubt­ <lb/>
              less a proud day for the bear-maiden, <lb/>
              was a universal custom and not a dis­ <lb/>
              tinctive honour; nor does it seem to <lb/>
              have been connected with the quin­ <lb/>
              quennial festival of the Brauronia of <lb/>
              which the poet is here speaking ; and <lb/>
              if the somewhat questionable statement <lb/>
              of a Scholiast here, whom Suidas copies, <lb/>
              be correct, and the maidens who took <lb/>
              part in the ceremony were not older <lb/>
              than ten, nor younger than five, this <lb/>
              cannot be the bear-maidenship to which <lb/>
              the speaker is referring. For at ten <lb/>
              years of age she became the Mill-maiden, <lb/>
              and it was not until later (<foreign xml:lang="grc">κᾇτ' ἔχουσα <lb/>
              κ.τ.λ</foreign>.) that she became the Bear-maiden. <lb/>
              Probably in the great quinquennial <lb/>
              festival, some maiden of fifteen or there­ <lb/>
              abouts was selected as a special distinc­ <lb/>
              tion to walk in the procession in yellow <lb/>
              robes as one of the sacred bears. See as <lb/>
              to this festival the authorities cited in <lb/>
              the Commentary on Peace 874. The <lb/>
              worship of the Brauronian Artemis was <lb/>
              not confined to the little town of <lb/>
              Brauron. There was a Temple in her <lb/>
              honour in Athens itself not far from the <lb/>

            contribution to be paid by the Allies to <lb/>
            the treasury at Delos for continuing the <lb/>
            maritime War against the Persian king. <lb/>
            The transfer of the treasury from Delos to <lb/>
            Athens was one of the most striking <lb/>
            symbols of the change from an Alliance <lb/>
            to an Empire. Thenceforward it became <lb/>
            a part, and indeed the larger part, of the <lb/>
            ordinary revenue of Athens. But since <lb/>
            the Sicilian catastrophe, such of the <lb/>
            Allies as thought that they could safely <lb/>
            do so were falling away and discon­ <lb/>
            tinuing their contributions, whilst the <lb/>
            Athenians themselves were becoming <lb/>
            unwilling, if not unable, to contribute <lb/>

              a blow with her hard rough slipper <lb/>
              upon the cheek of the Coryphaeus. I say <lb/>
              the " Coryphaeus ” because the leader of <lb/>

            of these women, they say, does not <lb/>
            diminish : it seems rather to augment; <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπιδώσειν προσθήκην σχήσειν</foreign>.—Scholiast. <lb/>
            Therefore we must again strip to our <lb/>

            over, the right shoulder, and so left the <lb/>
            right arm and shoulder uncovered <lb/>
            (whence indeed it derived its name), <lb/>
            was most commonly worn by slaves and <lb/>
            labourers, who were naturally able to <lb/>
            perform their tasks more easily when <lb/>
            their right arms were free. The old <lb/>
            men of the Semichorus, though free-born <lb/>
            Athenians, are wearing it here, to enable <lb/>
            them to handle more effectively the <lb/>
            great fire-logs they were carrying on <lb/>
            their entrance. It took the place of <lb/>

              not resume it till the Women (infra 1020) <lb/>

          <p>664. <foreign xml:lang="grc">λευκόποδες</foreign>]We must suppose <lb/>
            that the old men are wearing <foreign xml:lang="grc">λευκὰς <lb/>
            ἐμβάδας</foreign>. That these were commonly <lb/>
            worn by courtesans (Pollux vii. 92) is no <lb/>
            argument against their use by old men <lb/>
            in a Comedy; and the contention of <lb/>
            Bothe and others that <foreign xml:lang="grc">λευκόποδες</foreign> here <lb/>
            means "barefoot " seems quite inadmis­ <lb/>
            sible. The veterans had thrown off their <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐξωμίδες</foreign>, but not their shoes ; and in <lb/>
            truth " with bare white feet" would be <lb/>
            an epithet suitable to young girls rather <lb/>
            than to these old soldiers who would pride <lb/>
            themselves on being <foreign xml:lang="grc">μελάμποδες</foreign>: com­ <lb/>
            pare infra 800-4. But whatever the <lb/>
            exact signification of <foreign xml:lang="grc">λευκόποδες</foreign>, the <lb/>
            word is here intended to be a play upon <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">λυκόποδες</foreign>, an epithet applied to the <lb/>
            Alcmaeonidae and other exiles, in the <lb/>
            days when they were rising against the <lb/>
            "tyrant" house of the Peisistratidae. <lb/>
            For the veterans are still thinking of <lb/>
            the attempt of the women to impose <lb/>
            upon them the tyranny of Hippias" <lb/>
            (supra 618), and of their own determina­ <lb/>
            tion to resist that attempt to the utter­ <lb/>
            most. Why the insurgent Alcmaeonidae <lb/>
            were called <foreign xml:lang="grc">λυκόποδες</foreign> is uncertain. The <lb/>
            Scholiast thinks it was either because <lb/>
            their feet were clad in wolfskin, or be­ <lb/>
            cause they bore on their shields the <lb/>
            figure of a wolf; but it seems more pro­ <lb/>
            bable that it was a name given them <lb/>
            by their enemies because, like wolves, <lb/>
            they were always prowling about the <lb/>
            frontier, seeking an opportunity to <lb/>
            attack. But the exiles of whom the <lb/>
            Alcmaeonidae were the leaders," says <lb/>
            Aristotle, Polity of Athens, chap. 19, <lb/>
            " were unable by their own unassisted <lb/>
            efforts to effectuate their own restora­ <lb/>
            tion, and invariably met with disaster. <lb/>
            And amongst other failures was their <lb/>
            fortification of Leipsydrium which is <lb/>
            above Mount Parnes, where they were <lb/>
            successfully besieged by the tyrants; <lb/>
            whence came the Scolium: <lb/>
            Alas ! Alas ! Leipsydrium, comrade­ <lb/>
            betraying ! what men valiant in fight, <lb/>
            and noble of birth didst thou destroy ! <lb/>
            men who showed, by their valour from <lb/>
            what sires they sprang." <lb/>
            And he goes on to show how they <lb/>
            ultimately called in the Lacedaemo­ <lb/>
            nians under Cleomenes: and so the <lb/>
            Peisistratidae were expelled. See supra <lb/>
            273, infra 1151. The story is told by <lb/>
            Hdt. v. 62-5, and the Scolium is found <lb/>
            in many ancient authors. Possibly in <lb/>

            Acropolis became a familiar theme for <lb/>
            Athenian artists, as well as for Athenian <lb/>
            writers. Two large frescoes, one in the <lb/>
            Poecile (Pausanias i. 15) and the other <lb/>
            on the walls of the Temple of Theseus <lb/>
            (Id. i. 17), represented the great battle <lb/>

              attributes to his brush the fresco in the <lb/>
              Poecile ; and see Pliny xxxv. 35; whilst <lb/>
              Pausanias (i. 17) notices his connexion <lb/>
              with the paintings in the Theseium. <lb/>
              Micon was an Athenian painter of great <lb/>
              distinction, and some of the finest paint­ <lb/>
              ings in Athens were the joint productions <lb/>
              of himself and Polygnotus. There were <lb/>
              other representations in Athens of the <lb/>

            rectly given by the Scholiast on the <lb/>

            in Wasps 1448 and Peace 129, where <lb/>
            see the notes. The fable told how the <lb/>
            insignificant beetle, when injured by <lb/>
            the mighty Eagle, contrived to break <lb/>
            its adversary's eggs no matter where <lb/>
            they were laid, even when they were <lb/>
            laid in the bosom of Zeus. And as the <lb/>
            beetle acted, so Stratyllis will act. How­ <lb/>
            ever weak the women may appear, and <lb/>
            however strong the men, she will find <lb/>
            a way to repay them for all their wrong- <lb/>
            doing and insolence. The term <foreign xml:lang="grc">μαιεύσο­ <lb/>
            μαι</foreign> is employed because it was always <lb/>
            just as the Eagle had laid her eggs that <lb/>
            the beetle, like a <foreign xml:lang="grc">μαι̑</foreign>, would make its <lb/>

            all our people, that is, all the Athenians: <lb/>
            just as in 579 supra <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἄπαντας</foreign> means not <lb/>
            “all men " but "all Athenian citizens." <lb/>
            The <foreign xml:lang="grc">γείτονες</foreign> troves, on the other hand, are “ our <lb/>

            962 Lamachus wanted one for the <lb/>
            Dionysian festival. As to the Copaic eel <lb/>
            see the Commentary on 36 supra. It is <lb/>
            here described as if it were a virtuous <lb/>
            and well-loved maiden, a worthy com­ <lb/>
            panion of " the boys." The Scholiast <lb/>
            says <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸ</foreign> X <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὅτι τὴν γυναι̑κα ἑταἵραν εἵπεν ὡς <lb/>

            pression <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸ χ</foreign> seems to have puzzled the <lb/>
            editors of the scholia, but it stands for <lb/>
            "the epithet <foreign xml:lang="grc">χρηστήν</foreign>.” And the Scho- <lb/>
            East means that the epithet is employed <lb/>
            for the purpose of showing that <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἑταίραν</foreign> <lb/>
            is to be taken in a good, and not in a <lb/>

            under the influence of her demagogues, <lb/>
            was gradually becoming a democracy of <lb/>
            that unhappy type, in which the actions <lb/>
            of the State are directed not by settled <lb/>
            law, but by the ill-considered and <lb/>
            offhand " resolutions" of the popular <lb/>
            Assembly. “<foreign xml:lang="grc">Ετερονεἶδος δημοκρατίας</foreign>, <lb/>

              not know the nature of the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ψηφίσματα</foreign> <lb/>
              which had roused the hostility of the <lb/>
              Boeotians, but no doubt they were <lb/>
              consequent on the renewal of the War.</p>
          <p>705. <foreign xml:lang="grc">του̑ σκέλους λαβών</foreign>] As she says <lb/>
            this, Stratyllis catches the Coryphaeus <lb/>
            by the leg and topples him over. After <lb/>
            these four little skirmishes there is <lb/>
            a pause in the action of the Play, and <lb/>
            an interval of five clear days (infra 881) <lb/>
            is supposed to have elapsed between <lb/>
            this line and the next. Had there <lb/>
            been a Parabasis, this would have been <lb/>
            the placeforit. For this isthe <lb/>
            turning-point of the drama. Hitherto <lb/>
            the women have been revolting, and <lb/>
            establishing themselves in the Acropo­ <lb/>
            lis ; but now the spell is beginning <lb/>
            to work ; the separation of the sexes <lb/>
            has become intolerable to both ; the <lb/>
            men are ready to yield, and to make <lb/>
            peace with Sparta on any terms; and <lb/>
            the only danger is that the women may <lb/>
            anticipate them in yielding. It is this <lb/>
            danger which brings Lysistrata out <lb/>
            upon the stage, with evident signs of <lb/>
            perturbation and anxiety.</p>

            does not appear whether this statement <lb/>
            is confined to the first two lines or <lb/>
            should be extended to what follows. <lb/>
            Again on 713 he says <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐξ Εὐριπιδου</foreign>. <lb/>
            Anyhow it is plain that the first twelve <lb/>
            lines of this dialogue are either bor­ <lb/>
            rowed or parodied from Euripides, or <lb/>
            are a happy imitation of his style.</p>

              next line and infra 911, had been identi­ <lb/>
              fied with " a group of passages in the <lb/>
              rock on the north-west face of the <lb/>
              Acropolis, to which two openings ad­ <lb/>

              the two openings into Pan's grotto begins <lb/>
              a steep path leading up the face of the <lb/>
              rock to a doorway (now built up) <lb/>
              through the Acropolis wall. This is <lb/>
              the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὀπὴ</foreign> through which one of Lysi­ <lb/>
              strata's women passed, Aristoph. Lys. <lb/>
              720." For "passed" Mr. Hill should <lb/>
              have written " was trying to pass " ; but <lb/>
              I assume that the identification is correct. <lb/>
              Only I imagine that there could have <lb/>
              been no actual "doorway" in Lysi­ <lb/>
              strata's time. The expression <foreign xml:lang="grc">διαλέγουα <lb/>
              τὴν ὀπὴν</foreign> seems to imply the clearing out <lb/>
              of some irregular or overgrown aperture; <lb/>
              and the term <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὀπὴ</foreign> itself would natu­ <lb/>
              rally here, as in Wasps 350, 352, point <lb/>
              to a diminutive hole, through which <lb/>

            Suidas s. v. <foreign xml:lang="grc">οἴκοι</foreign>—give it an entirely <lb/>
            different origin. It was used, they say, <lb/>
            of persons who make a display of luxury <lb/>
            out of place. And they explain it by <lb/>
            alleging that when Aristagoras came to <lb/>
            Sparta, seeking aid against the Persians <lb/>
            (Hdt. v. 49-51), he was clothed in <lb/>
            sumptuous Milesian raiment, whereupon <lb/>
            an Ephor called out <foreign xml:lang="grc">οἴκοι τὰ Μιλήσια</foreign>, <lb/>
            keep your Milesian luxuryfor home. But <lb/>

              offering taken from her treasury, as <lb/>
              Paulmier and Enger suppose. And <lb/>
              although, apparently, Lysistrata had <lb/>
              not actually seen the helmet when she <lb/>
              pronounced it to be <foreign xml:lang="grc">χαλκίον τι</foreign>, yet we <lb/>
              must, I think, understand that her sur­ <lb/>
              mise was correct, and therefore that it <lb/>
              was not, when exposed to view, dis­ <lb/>
              covered to be the golden helmet of the <lb/>

              bronze helmet was irremovable would not <lb/>
              affect its removability in a Comic Play. <lb/>
              And Paulmier's objection that the bronze <lb/>
              statue was of colossal size is sufficiently <lb/>
              answered by Bothe, who refers to 755 as <lb/>
              showing that such must also have been <lb/>

              undoubtedly the name-day, Birds 922, <lb/>
              923); and Hesychius, s. v., also identifies <lb/>
              it with the name-day. But the same <lb/>
              lexicographer, s. v. <foreign xml:lang="grc">δρομιάμφιον ἦμαρ</foreign>, <lb/>
              places it on the seventh day, whilst the <lb/>
              Platonic Scholiast and Suidas, s. v., place <lb/>
              it on the fifth, the former identifying it <lb/>
              with, and the latter distinguishing it <lb/>
              from, the name-day. It seems most <lb/>
              probable that the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀμφιδρὅμια</foreign> took place <lb/>
              on the name-day, that is, on the tenth day <lb/>
              after birth: for we know that on that <lb/>
              day a great festival was held (Birds 493, <lb/>
              494, and the note there); and it is unlikely <lb/>

              three golden apples which she, being a <lb/>
              woman, must needs turn aside to pick <lb/>
              up. The story is told by Apollodorus <lb/>
              iii. 9. 6; and is familiar to English <lb/>
              readers as the first tale in Morris's <lb/>
              " Earthly Paradise." Atalanta was a <lb/>
              hater of men, but we nowhere hear of <lb/>
              Melanion as a hater of women, and the <lb/>
              Scholiast evidently thinks that the story <lb/>
              was concocted by the old men for this <lb/>
              particular occasion. That he dwelt for <lb/>
              some period in the forests all agree, and <pb n="97"/>

              the simple statement of the old men, <lb/>
              worded as in a nursery tale, that " he <lb/>
              had a dog," is illustrated by Xenophon's <lb/>
              reference to him as a mighty hunter, <lb/>
              fond of dogs and the chase, <foreign xml:lang="grc">κυνῶν καὶ <lb/>
              κυνηγεσίν</foreign>, De Venatione i. 5 and 7. <lb/>
              But according to the Roman poets he <lb/>
              endured the hardships of a homeless <lb/>
              life not from his hatred of women, but <lb/>
              for love of Atalanta, and won from her <lb/>
              in return that pity which is akin to love; <lb/>
              Ovid, Art of Love ii. 185-97; Propertius <lb/>

            winds up his little apologue by proposing <lb/>
            to kiss Stratyllis ; but that this does not <lb/>
            indicate a more friendly feeling on his <lb/>
            part is shown by his still addressing her <lb/>
            with the offensive appellation <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὦ γραῦ</foreign>, <lb/>
            and his real object is disclosed by his <lb/>
            next words. Under pretence of kissing <lb/>
            her, he meant to approach close to her, <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">κἀνατείνας λακτίσαι</foreign>, and to lift his foot <lb/>
            and kick her. And it is plain from <lb/>
            what follows that he made as though he <lb/>
            would carry this threat into execution.</p>
          <p>798. <foreign xml:lang="grc">κρόμμυόν τἄρκ.τ.λ</foreign>.] Thenyou shall <lb/>

            μὴ φάγῃ σκόροδα</foreign> of 689 supra ; and here, <lb/>
            as there, the Scholiast's explanation is <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐ πολεμήσεις</foreign>. So in Peace 1129 the <lb/>
            Chorus, rejoicing in the advent of Peace, <lb/>

            <foreign xml:lang="grc">τυροῦ</foreign> Kat <foreign xml:lang="grc">κρομμύων</foreign>. The Scholiast gives <lb/>
            an alternative interpretation <foreign xml:lang="grc">κλαύσει καὶ <lb/>
            χωρὶς κρομμύων</foreign>, treating <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἔδει</foreign> as coming <lb/>

            onion to make you weep ; you will weep <lb/>
            without that." This is accepted by <lb/>
            several commentators, and is represented <lb/>
            in my translation ; but it requires the <lb/>
            substitution of <foreign xml:lang="grc">κρομμύου</foreign> or <foreign xml:lang="grc">κρομμύων</foreign> for <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">κρόμμυον</foreign> which is found in all the MSS. <lb/>

            means a copse or thicket (Birds 202), is <lb/>
            here used of the dense growth of hair <lb/>
            visible on the veteran's uplifted leg. <lb/>
            This would be particularly obnoxious to <lb/>
            Athenian women who were careful to <lb/>
            eradicate every superfluous hair on their <lb/>
            own persons. The word is used in a <lb/>
            similar sense in Eccl. 61, where the <lb/>
            Woman who has been training herself <lb/>
            to pass off as a man describes her arm­ <lb/>
            pits as <foreign xml:lang="grc">λόχμης δασυτέρας</foreign>. See the note <lb/>

            which the women object is a sign of <lb/>
            manly strength and hardihood ; and the <lb/>
            Men reply that in this respect they <lb/>
            resemble the noblest of their race. Of <lb/>
            all the national heroes who flourished <lb/>
            after the termination of the Persian <lb/>
            War, Myronides—whose remarkable <lb/>
            victories (1) over the Corinthians, and <lb/>
            (2) over the Boeotians, B.C. 459-456, <lb/>
            extended the Athenian supremacy by <lb/>
            land to the utmost limits it ever at­ <lb/>
            tained—and Phormio- whose brilliant <lb/>
            achievements in the Corinthian gulf at <lb/>
            the commencement of the Peloponnesian <lb/>
            War established the Athenian supremacy <lb/>
            by sea—appear to be the two who <lb/>
            appealed most strongly to the mind of <lb/>
            Aristophanes. Myronides is mentioned <lb/>
            again Eccl. 304, where he is styled o <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">γεννάδας</foreign> ; and Phormio has already <lb/>
            been mentioned in Knights 562, Peace <lb/>

          <p>802. <foreign xml:lang="grc">μελάμπυγος</foreign>] This also was es­ <lb/>

            πύγους᾽ ἀνδρείους</foreign>.—Photius. It was a <lb/>
            special epithet of Heracles, and all the <lb/>
            grammarians and proverb-collectors tell <lb/>
            the well-known story of "Heracles and <lb/>
            the two rascals." The two had been <lb/>
            accustomed to prey upon the passers by ; <lb/>
            and their mother used to warn them to <lb/>
            desist, lest they should one day meet <lb/>
            with <foreign xml:lang="grc">τινὸς μελαμπύγου</foreign> (merely meaning <lb/>
            as Zenobius v. 10, Gaisford, Paroem, p. 342 <lb/>
            explains it <foreign xml:lang="grc">τινὸς ἀνδρείου καὶ ἰσχυροῦ</foreign>), and <lb/>
            get the worst of it. However they con­ <lb/>
            tinued their practices and became such a <lb/>
            pest to the neighbourhood that Heracles <lb/>
            had to suppress them. He tied their <lb/>
            feet together, and suspended them, head <lb/>
            downwards, on a pole which he carried <lb/>
            over his shoulder. Hanging in this <lb/>
            position they had a clear view of his <lb/>
            "nigerrimas nates." Remembering <lb/>

              completely it was fulfilled, not only in <lb/>
              the sense in which she spoke it, but also <lb/>
              in its most literal sense, they both <lb/>
              suddenly burst into fits of laughter. <lb/>
              Heracles, surprised at their mirth, <lb/>
              inquired what the joke might be. <lb/>
              They told him, and he, being always at <lb/>
              heart a good fellow, joined in the laugh­ <lb/>
              ter, and finally let them go. The inci­ <lb/>
              dent is versified by Charles Lamb in a <lb/>
              poem of no great merit included in his <lb/>
              Eliana. Here the expression means <lb/>
              that Myronides was a very Heracles to <lb/>
              his foes.</p>

            your Melanion.</p>
          <p>808. <foreign xml:lang="grc">Τίμων ἦν τις</foreign>] There was one Timon. <lb/>
            She speaks in this vague way because <lb/>
            she is making up a nursery story; for <lb/>
            at this time the name of the famous <lb/>
            misanthrope was very well known at <lb/>
            Athens. See Birds 1549 and the Com­ <lb/>
            mentary there. The strange phraseo­ <lb/>
            logy in which he is here described is <lb/>
            probably intended to burlesque some <lb/>
            expressions in the <foreign xml:lang="grc">Μονότροπος</foreign> of Phry­ <lb/>
            nichus, a Comedy which competed with <lb/>
            the "Birds." The only fragment of <lb/>
            that Play bearing on Timon which has <lb/>
            reached us is full of quaint epithets, <figure type="illustration">

              Photius, Eustathius and the Scholia mi­ <lb/>
              nora at Iliad xiii. 562, 564, the Scholiast <lb/>
              here, and Suidas ; though they also give <lb/>
              as an alternative a pointed stake; and <lb/>
              that seems to be the sense in which <lb/>
              Homer used it. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀπορρὼξ</foreign> is an offshoot, <lb/>
              a chip of the Erinyes.</p>
          <p>814. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὑπὸ μίσους</foreign>] The words are intro­ <lb/>
            duced in a somewhat unconnected man­ <lb/>
            ner, but Stratyllis is adopting the <lb/>
            language of the Men, supra 792. It is <lb/>
            apparent from the strophe that a line, <lb/>
            consisting of a paeon and a spondee, <lb/>
            has fallen out either before or after the <lb/>
            present line. The words in brackets <lb/>
            are inserted merely to complete the <lb/>
            sense and the metre, and not as being <lb/>
            really what Aristophanes wrote. <note type="footnote"> H 2 </note> <pb n="100"/>

            nor three lines below, is the epithet <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">πονηροὶ</foreign> intended to restrict the univer­ <lb/>
            sality of the word <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἄνδρες</foreign>. If the Scho­ <lb/>

            τοὺς πονηροὺς</foreign> means that Timon did not <lb/>

            very illuminating, but I quote it as <lb/>
            showing that even the old gram­ <lb/>

            battlements of the Acropolis. Hitherto <lb/>
            the whole business of the stage has <lb/>
            been conducted outside the Propylaea. <lb/>
            If Lysistrata wishes to parley with the <lb/>
            Men, she comes out of the Acropolis; <lb/>
            when the parley is over, she retires into <lb/>
            the Acropolis, and so on. But now for <lb/>
            the first and only time in the Play we <lb/>
            see the defenders not outside the Pro­ <lb/>
            pylaea, but standing on the wall itself, <lb/>
            and thence conversing with those out­ <lb/>
            side. It is possible that during the <lb/>
            little interchange of amenities which <lb/>
            has just passed between the two Cho­ <lb/>

            pushed forward on the stage, whence at <lb/>
            the conclusion of the scene, perhaps <lb/>
            during the final banter between the <lb/>
            Choruses, infra 1014-42, it is with­ <lb/>

            the former interpretation, referring it, <lb/>
            I presume, to the <foreign xml:lang="grc">δεράτινοναἱδοι̑ον</foreign> <lb/>
            with which Cinesias, and henceforth all <lb/>
            the men on the stage, are undoubtedly <lb/>

            Clouds 542. But it is quite clear from <lb/>
            the ensuing scene that he retains this <lb/>
            appendage; and it is equally clear from <lb/>
            his use of the present tense <foreign xml:lang="grc">δἱδωμι</foreign>, and <lb/>
            from Lysistrata's immediate acqui­ <lb/>
            escence, that he does at once give her <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ο̎περ ε̎Χει</foreign>. It seems to me therefore that <lb/>
            the Scholiast's second interpretation is <lb/>
            the correct one, and that Cinesias <lb/>
            throws up to Lysistrata a <foreign xml:lang="grc">βαλλάντιον</foreign> or <lb/>

            a man, so loveable and dear to me. In <lb/>
            the Fourteenth Iliad Zeus is so en­ <lb/>
            amoured of Hera as (to use the language <lb/>

            Cinesias takes her language as a proof <lb/>
            of her love for himself. She now re­ <lb/>
            turns into the Acropolis, but imme­ <lb/>

          <p>921. <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸ δεῖνα</foreign>] What was it ? So again <lb/>
            five lines below and 1168 infra. The <lb/>
            force of this dilatory ejaculation is suf­ <lb/>
            ficiently explained and illustrated in <lb/>
            the Commentary on Peace 268 and <lb/>
            Wasps 524. I will here only add one <lb/>
            other example taken from the twelfth <lb/>
            of Lucian's Courtesan-Dialogues. There <lb/>
            Lysias finds his ladylove in a very com­ <lb/>
            promising situation with a young person <lb/>
            whom he supposes to be a man, but <lb/>
            who in reality is a girl named Pythias. <lb/>
            Pythias had been obliged, in an illness, <lb/>
            to have her head shaved, and her hair <lb/>
            was now as short as a boy's, of which <lb/>
            she was grievously ashamed. Usually <lb/>
            to hide her disgrace she wore a wig, but <lb/>
            she was not wearing it when Lysias <lb/>
            caught her with his ladylove. So, in <lb/>
            order to exculpate her friend, she <lb/>
            allows her sex to be revealed, and the <lb/>
            loss of her hair to be explained; but <lb/>
            concludes by saying <foreign xml:lang="grc">πλὴν</foreign>, TO <foreign xml:lang="grc">δεῖνα</foreign>, opo, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὦ</foreign> <lb/>

            and corresponding in every particular. <lb/>

            These are the scytales. And when they <lb/>
            want to send a private message to the <lb/>

            strip of parchment and wind it spirally <lb/>
            round and round the retained scytale <lb/>
            so as to cover the entire surface with­ <lb/>
            out leaving any gap. On the parch­ <lb/>
            ment while so wound round the scytale <lb/>
            they write the message, and then taking <lb/>
            the parchment off they send it to the <lb/>
            general without the scytale. It is then <lb/>
            a quite illegible scrawl of disconnected <lb/>
            letters till the general,- winding it <lb/>
            round his own scytale, restores the <lb/>

            is merely an inference from the present <lb/>
            passage, it is a natural and I think <lb/>
            a correct inference. As to the city Pel­ <lb/>

            cities, we know that at the outbreak of <lb/>
            the Peloponnesian War it was the only <lb/>
            one of them which sided with Sparta, <lb/>
            Thuc. ii. 9. Though itself at some <lb/>
            distance from the sea, it was neverthe­ <lb/>
            less a naval power, and we are told that <lb/>
            at this very time the Spartans were <lb/>
            requisitioning Pellene to contribute, in <lb/>
            conjunction with Sicyon and Arcadia, <lb/>
            a detachment of ten vessels to the con­ <lb/>
            federate fleet which was mustering for the <lb/>
            downfall of Athens, Thuc. viii. 3. And <lb/>
            possibly the anxiety of Sparta to obtain <lb/>
            the aid of so petty a state may have <lb/>
            given some occasion for ridicule.</p>

            is a very inadequate explanation. The <lb/>
            suggestion that this strange upset was <lb/>

              casus." The Herald, however, takes a <lb/>
              more prosaic view, and ascribes the <lb/>
              epidemic not to Pan but to Lampito, <lb/>
              who had been vigorously carrying out <lb/>
              the policy determined upon by herself, <lb/>

            This rope was called <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὕσπληξ</foreign> and is <lb/>

              has come over the spirit of the Women. <lb/>
              They have already come down from <lb/>
              fierce denunciation to playful banter, <lb/>

              of coquetry which the Men are unable <lb/>
              to resist. The twenty-two lines which <lb/>
              follow are in a compound or disjointed <lb/>
              (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀσυνάρτητος</foreign>) metre; the first half being <lb/>

              differs from the ordinary trochaic tetra­ <lb/>
              meter only by having the eleventh sylla­ <lb/>
              ble short instead of long ; as for example, <lb/>

              metre does in truth change into the <lb/>

              his well-known epigram (xii. 47) : <lb/>
              Diffieilis, facilis, iucundus, acerbus es idem : <lb/>
              Nee tecum possum vivere, nec sine to.</p>
          <p>The notion was a favourite one with <lb/>
            our comic dramatists; see for example <lb/>
            the song in Act I, Scene 2 of Prince <lb/>
            Hoare's " Lock and Key." Brunck refers <lb/>
            to Susarion's lines cited in the Commen­ <lb/>
            tary on Thesm. 787 ; and Dindorf to <lb/>
            Strabo xiv. 2. 24 (p. 659), where speak­ <lb/>
            ing of the two orators, contemporary <lb/>
            with himself, of Mylasa, he tells us that <lb/>
            Hybreas wound up one of his speeches <lb/>
            by saying to Euthydemus, <foreign xml:lang="grc">Εὐθύδημε, <lb/>

            Men or Semichorus of Women. The <lb/>
            two are combined into one Chorus. <lb/>
            They make, in the language of the <lb/>
            Greek Argument, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἕνα χορὸνἐκ τῆς διχορίας</foreign>.</p>
          <p>1043. <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐ παρασκευαζόμεσθα</foreign>] The two <lb/>
            Choruses inaugurate their union by <lb/>
            commencing a series of four stanzas, <lb/>
            two here and two infra 1189, which <lb/>
            like those in Birds 1470, 1553, and 1694 <lb/>
            are entirely disconnected with the <lb/>
            general plot of the Comedy, and are all <lb/>
            linked together by the conjunctive <lb/>
            particle <foreign xml:lang="grc">δέ</foreign>. Each stanza consists of <lb/>
            seventeen lines, of which eleven are <lb/>
            trochaic (nine dimeters and two dipo­ <lb/>
            dies), and the remaining six (the fourth <lb/>
            to the ninth inclusive in each stanza) <lb/>
            eretico-paeonic dimeters, the third hav­ <lb/>
            ing a monosyllabic base. And the same <lb/>
            vein of pleasantry runs through the <lb/>
            four, consisting of large and liberal <lb/>
            offers made by the Chorus, with an <pb n="123"/>

              no intention of fulfilling them. Each <lb/>
              stanza, in effect, contains what school­ <lb/>
              boys call "a sell." Come and help <lb/>
              yourselves to our money, they say in the <lb/>
              first stanza, only ourpurses are all empty. <lb/>
              Come to our house andfeast, in the second, <lb/>
              only you will find the door barred against <lb/>
              you. Come and share our treasures, in <lb/>
              the third, only if you find any, you must <lb/>
              have sharper eyes than we. And come to <lb/>

              satisfactory, but on the whole I think it <lb/>
              must be accurate. The Chorus wish to <lb/>

            seems necessary ; otherwise this stanza, <lb/>
            unlike all the rest, would contain no <lb/>
            " sell," but would be a bona fide offer of <lb/>
            a money-gift. This too would destroy <lb/>
            the humour of the last words of the <lb/>

            a further boon. And Burges's emenda­ <lb/>

            Diod. Sic. iv. 37. That a large number <lb/>
            of these aboriginal allies were at this <lb/>
            very time stationed within the walls of <lb/>
            Athens we know from Thucydides (viii. <lb/>

            in the service of the Four Hundred. <lb/>
            And it may perhaps be inferred, from <lb/>
            the way in which they are mentioned <lb/>
            here and again in 1182 infra, that they <lb/>
            had rendered themselves notorious by <lb/>

            disease from which you are suffering is on <lb/>

            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀσκητικὸν νόσημα</foreign> as well as they. And <lb/>
            to ascertain the facts, the speaker pro­ <lb/>
            ceeds in the following line to inquire <lb/>
            into the symptoms, asking whether the <lb/>
            sufferers feel the attack most keenly of <lb/>
            a morning, <foreign xml:lang="grc">πρὸς ὄρθρον</foreign>. Cf. supra 966, <lb/>
            Ach. 256. The fact that the same <lb/>
            demonstrative pronoun (<foreign xml:lang="grc">αὕτη, ταύτη</foreign>) is <lb/>
            applied to both sides, as in Eccl. 1070, <lb/>
            would create no difficulty in the acting, <lb/>
            where the speaker would point first to <lb/>
            the one and then to the other. See the <lb/>
            note on Eccl. 1053.</p>

            to Frogs 422, see the Commentary on <lb/>
            those passages. The Scholiast here says <lb/>

            κωμῳδούμενος</foreign>, but the statement as to <lb/>
            his parentage is in all probability <lb/>
            derived merely from the passage in the <lb/>

            to conceal their woful plight; but it <lb/>
            would seem that the Laconians have <lb/>
            discarded theirs, and that this warning <lb/>
            is specially addressed to them; see infra <lb/>
            1096, 1098, 1099.</p>
          <p>1094. '<foreign xml:lang="grc">Ερμοκοπιδῶν</foreign>] He means the <lb/>

            lation of the Herniae shortly before the <lb/>
            departure of the great armament for <lb/>
            Sicily. These Hermae were quadran­ <lb/>
            gular busts of stone (Thuc. vi. 27) with <lb/>
            a rudely-shaped head at the top, and the <lb/>
            phallus emblem protruding in front; <lb/>
            see Hdt. ii. 51. And the mutilation was <lb/>
            effected by cutting off the head and the <lb/>

            dress occurs infra 1242. And as it is <lb/>
            applied to two different persons, here <lb/>
            to the foremost Athenian plenipoten­ <lb/>
            tiary and there apparently to one of <lb/>
            the Laconians themselves, it seems plain <lb/>
            that it is used not as a proper name, but <lb/>
            as a term of affection, sweetheart, channer, <lb/>
            doubtless a well-known Spartan mode of <lb/>
            address.</p>
          <p>1099. <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὤνδρες</foreign>] The men of whom the <lb/>
            Chorus were speaking, that is, as the <lb/>
            Scholiast says, the '<foreign xml:lang="grc">Ερμοπίδαι</foreign> He <lb/>

            interesting, more for the coincidence of <lb/>
            the language than for the fact, to observe <lb/>
            that very shortly after the exhibition of <lb/>
            this Play, the Council of Four Hundred <lb/>
            were, Thucydides tells us, sending to <lb/>
            Sparta <foreign xml:lang="grc">περὶ ξυμβάσεως πρέσβεις, βουλόμε­ <lb/>
            νοι διαλλαγῆναι</foreign>, Thuc. viii. 71. The lan­ <lb/>

            ordinary manner.</p>

            if you like, Lysistratus as well. He is <lb/>
            playing on the meaning of the name; <lb/>
            not only Lysistrata (the woman who will <lb/>
            end the war), but also, if you will, <lb/>
            Lysistratus (the man who will do so). <lb/>
            He will welcome anybody, man or woman, <lb/>
            who will be " a disbander of armies," <lb/>
            and restore Peace to Hellas. " Non tarn <lb/>
            ad personam respicit," says Bergler, <lb/>
            “ quam ad significationem vocis." It <lb/>
            is not likely that there is any allusion <lb/>
            to the Lysistratus of Ach. 855, Knights <lb/>
            1267, and Wasps 787, 1302-8 or to any <lb/>

            It is like the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐξέρχομαι γὰρ αὐτομάτη</foreign> of <lb/>

            Acropolis, accompanied by a female <lb/>

              scene she fulfils her natural function <lb/>
              by bringing up, first one combatant, <lb/>
              and then the other, to listen to the words <lb/>
              of peace. Fourteen years before, in the <lb/>
              Acharnians (988-99), the Chorus had <lb/>
              addressed <foreign xml:lang="grc">Διαλλαγὴ</foreign> in the most endear­ <lb/>
              ing terms, as the bride in whose com­ <lb/>
              pany they would fain pass all their days. <lb/>
              On <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀνδρειοτάη</foreign> as applied to a woman <lb/>
              see Wasps 1090 and the note there.</p>
          <p>1109. <foreign xml:lang="grc">δεινὴν κ.τ.λ</foreign>.] A word, obviously <lb/>
            an epithet of Lysistrata, has dropped <lb/>
            out of this line ; and we have no means <lb/>
            of restoring it. The only guess which <lb/>
            has obtained any acceptance is that of <lb/>
            Bentley, who suggested that <foreign xml:lang="grc">δειλὴν</foreign> might <lb/>
            be inserted after <foreign xml:lang="grc">δεινήν</foreign>;" ut omnia <lb/>
            contraria sint; ut etiam <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸ σεμνὸν</foreign> est <foreign xml:lang="grc">τῳ̑ <lb/>
            ἀγανῳ̑</foreign>.” But <foreign xml:lang="grc">δειλὴ</foreign> is not a very apt <lb/>
            word to form a contrast with <foreign xml:lang="grc">δεινή; <lb/>
            σεμνὴ</foreign> is more naturally opposed to <foreign xml:lang="grc">φαύλη</foreign> <lb/>
            (Eccl. 617) than to <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀγανή</foreign>; and it seems <lb/>
            inconceivable that Lysistrata should in <lb/>
            any sense be called upon to become <foreign xml:lang="grc">δειλή</foreign>. <lb/>
            I have therefore, as a makeshift, inserted <lb/>
            the word <foreign xml:lang="grc">χαλεπὴν</foreign> (in brackets) between <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">σεμνὴν</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀγανὴν</foreign>, so that <foreign xml:lang="grc">δεινὴν</foreign> is con­ <lb/>
            trasted with <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀγαθὴν, φαύλην</foreign> with <foreign xml:lang="grc">σεμνὴν</foreign>, <lb/>
            and <foreign xml:lang="grc">χαλεπὴν</foreign> a severe judge (Wasps 942) <lb/>
            with <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀγανὴν</foreign> a gracious one. <figure type="illustration">

              <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἴυγξ</foreign> is our wryneck (Iynx torquilla) is <lb/>
              certain from the excellent account which <lb/>
              Aristotle gives of the bird in his History <lb/>
              of Animals ii. 8. 2. Most birds, he says, <lb/>
              have three toes in front and one behind; <lb/>
              but some have two in front and two <lb/>
              behind, <foreign xml:lang="grc">οἷον ἡ καλουμένη ἴυγξ</foreign>. This bird, <lb/>
              he goes on to explain, is somewhat <lb/>
              larger than a finch, and has <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὴν γλῶτταν</foreign> <figure type="illustration">

              This is a very accurate description of <lb/>
              our common wryneck, which has (to <lb/>
              quote from Newton's Yarrell, and <lb/>
              Morris) "two toes before and two be­ <lb/>
              hind; claws much hooked and very <lb/>
              sharp." " It obtains its food by its long <lb/>
              projectile tongue, two inches and a <lb/>
              quarter in length, which is darted for­ <lb/>
              ward and retracted with unerring aim <lb/>
              and with great velocity." " Its name <lb/>
              comes from its habit of rolling its head <lb/>
              and neck in a wonderful way, throwing <lb/>
              its head from side to side, or twisting it <lb/>
              round over its back." Modern naturalists <lb/>
              class it among the woodpeckers (Picidae). <lb/>
              The wryneck when bound to a slowly <lb/>
              revolving wheel was supposed to act as <lb/>
              a magical philter or love-charm, at­ <lb/>
              tracting to the operator the love of the <lb/>
              person upon whom the spell was directed. <lb/>
              Then the wheel itself, without the wry­ <lb/>
              neck, was called <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἴυγξ</foreign>. And finally the <lb/>
              word came to be applied generally, as <lb/>
              in the present passage, to any charm or <lb/>
              natural attractiveness, and is very fre­ <lb/>
              quently employed in that sense by the <lb/>
              best writers, from Pindar downwards. <figure type="illustration">

            generally agreed that the preceding <lb/>
            line, and also the two which follow, are <lb/>

            doubt, as Wagner suggests (Fragm. <lb/>
            Frag. Graec. ii. 254), from the opening <lb/>
            sentences of Melanippe's celebrated ora­ <lb/>
            tion, which formed the central feature of <lb/>
            the Play and gave it its distinctive name, <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">Μελανίππη ἡ ΣΟΦΗ</foreign>. Melanippe, so the <lb/>
            story ran, had borne twin sons, the fruit <lb/>
            of an illicit intercourse with Poseidon, <lb/>
            and had hidden them in the cowhouse. <lb/>
            Her father, finding them there, and <lb/>
            supposing them to be the monstrous <lb/>
            progeny of his cows, was minded to purge <lb/>
            his house from the pollution by com­ <lb/>
            mitting them both to the flames. There­ <lb/>
            upon Melanippe, eager to save her <lb/>
            children, comes forward and delivers <lb/>
            a long philosophic oration, thoroughly <lb/>
            characteristic of Euripides but, as Ari­ <lb/>
            stotle (Poetics xv) observes, utterly in­ <lb/>
            appropriate on the lips of Melanippe. <lb/>
            She commences with the commence­ <lb/>
            ment of the world when, according to <lb/>
            Anaxagoras (of whom Euripides had <lb/>
            been a follower in his youth), the whole <lb/>
            universe, earth and sky, formed one <lb/>

              identity of essence; and there is nothing <lb/>
              to surprise a philosopher (however <lb/>
              strange it might seem to ordinary mor­ <lb/>

              interchange with another, and cows give <lb/>
              birth to human children as well as to <lb/>
              calves. Why then condemn to death <lb/>
              these innocent babes, who are no ill- <lb/>
              omened portent, but merely what on high <lb/>
              philosophic principles a cow might well <lb/>
              be expected naturally to produce.-If <lb/>
              the other lines are drawn from the same <lb/>
              source they are in all probability con­ <lb/>
              siderably altered by Aristophanes, and <lb/>
              the wisdom which Lysistrata attributes <lb/>
              to herfather’s teaching was byMelanippe <lb/>
              ascribed to her mother. See the lines <lb/>
              quoted from the same speech in the <lb/>
              Commentary on Thesm. 14. After all <lb/>
              this eloquence we can hardly wonderthat <lb/>
              the <foreign xml:lang="grc">Μελανίππη σοφὴ</foreign>, " the philosophic <lb/>
              Melanippe," of the first Tragedy became <lb/>

            αὐτοὺς θεοὺς τιμῶντες</foreign>, but Lysistrata's <lb/>
            language goes far beyond that. Not <lb/>
            only do they worship the same Gods, <lb/>
            they worship them at the selfsame <lb/>
            altars, and sprinkle those altars as they <lb/>
            walk around them with lustral water <lb/>
            from one and the selfsame laver. (For <lb/>
            this circumambulation of the altar with <lb/>
            the laver see Peace 956-8, Birds 850, <lb/>

            refers to the <foreign xml:lang="grc">Πυλαία</foreign>, the annual autumnal <lb/>
            meeting of the Amphictyonic Council in <lb/>
            the neighbourhood of Thermopylae ; to <lb/>
            which the Athenians sent every year a <lb/>
            deputation consisting of one <foreign xml:lang="grc">῾Ιερομνήμων</foreign> <lb/>
            and three <foreign xml:lang="grc">Πυλαγόραι</foreign>. The Scholiast tells <lb/>
            us that this whole line is taken from the <lb/>
            Erechtheus of Euripides ; and another <lb/>
            grammarian ascribes line 1135 to the <lb/>
            same poet. Some have thought there­ <pb n="133"/>

              fore that the Scholium here should be <lb/>
              transferred to line 1135 ; but it is more <lb/>
              reasonable to suppose that both state­ <lb/>
              ments are correct. The whole pas­ <lb/>
              sage, indeed Lysistrata's whole speech, <lb/>
              whether borrowed from Tragedy or not, <lb/>
              is in a distinctly Tragic style. See <lb/>
              Wagner's Tragic Fragments ii. 186.</p>
          <p>1133. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐχθρῶν παρόντων βαρβάρων</foreign>] The <lb/>
            Scholiast says <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὡς τῶν Λακώνων χρωμένων <lb/>
            συμμάχοις βαρβάροις</foreign>. And with this al­ <lb/>
            most all the Commentators agree. But <lb/>
            although the Laconians were in fact at <lb/>
            this moment in alliance with the Per­ <lb/>
            sians (Thuc. viii. 18, &amp;c.), it seems <lb/>
            impossible that there can be any <lb/>
            special allusion to that circumstance <lb/>
            here. In this section of her speech <lb/>
            Lysistrata is expressly confining her­ <lb/>
            self to actions for which both parties <lb/>
            are equally blamable ; nor are the <lb/>
            words apt for describing an alliance <lb/>
            between one party and the Barbarians. <lb/>
            In my judgement the expression <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐχθρῶν <lb/>
            παρόντων βαρβάρων</foreign> means in the presence <lb/>
            of our barbarian enemies. These inter- <lb/>
            Hellenic contests are always hateful; <lb/>
            they are simple madness when we <lb/>
            know that our Barbarian enemies are <lb/>
            all the while looking on, ready to <lb/>
            take advantage of our self-inflicted <lb/>
            misfortunes.</p>
          <p>1136. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀπόλλυμαι</foreign>] He is not referring <lb/>
            to his former condition ; he is speaking <lb/>
            of the straits to which he is reduced by <lb/>
            Lysistrata's charms. Cf. infra 1148, 1158. <lb/>
            These little farcical interruptions are <lb/>
            intended as a set-off to the real earnest­ <lb/>
            ness of Lysistrata's harangue.</p>
          <p>1138. <foreign xml:lang="grc">Περικλείδας</foreign>] In order to remind <lb/>
            the Spartans of their obligations to <lb/>
            Athens, Lysistrata appeals to the events <lb/>
            which happened at the outbreak of what <lb/>
            is sometimes called the Third Messenian <lb/>
            War, 464 B. c. It was the year when the <lb/>
            great earthquake shook down almost <lb/>
            every house in Sparta, and the Messe­ <lb/>
            nian helots, rising against their masters, <lb/>
            established themselves in the mountain <lb/>
            fortress of Ithome. The Spartans, un­ <lb/>
            skilled in sieges, and in sore distress <lb/>
            amid the ruins of their city, called upon <lb/>
            their allies for help. Pericleidas was <lb/>
            the officer sent to Athens to implore <lb/>
            the assistance of the Athenians, which <lb/>
            was granted at the instance of Cimon; <lb/>
            Plutarch, Cimon 16. Probably Cimon <lb/>
            and Pericleidas were friends, and it is <lb/>
            noteworthy that while the former named <lb/>
            one of his sons Lacedaemonius (Plutarch <pb n="134"/>
            <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BELL_07_fig261.jpg"/></figure> <lb/>
              ubi supra), the latter named one of his <lb/>
              <foreign xml:lang="grc">᾽Αθήναιος</foreign> (Thnc. iv. 119). Accordingly <lb/>
              Cimon at once proceeded <foreign xml:lang="grc">πλήθει οὐκ <lb/>
              ὀλίγῳ</foreign>, says Thucydides (i. 102), " with <lb/>
              4,000 hoplites," says Aristophanes, to <lb/>
              take part in the siege of Ithome. Lysis­ <lb/>
              trata was fully justified in instancing <lb/>
              this expedition as an act of friendly, and <lb/>
              even generous, feeling on the part of <lb/>
              the Athenians towards Sparta; but <lb/>
              when she proceeds to say that it <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὅλην <lb/>
              ἔσωσε τὴν Λακεδαίμονα</foreign>, she is presuming <lb/>
              on the forgetfulness of her hearers about <lb/>
              events which happened more than half <lb/>
              a century before. For the Athenian con­ <lb/>
              tingent effected nothing, not from any <lb/>
              fault of their own, but because the <lb/>
              Spartans, suspicious of their restless <lb/>
              and innovating spirit, and possibly dis­ <lb/>
              cerning some signs of sympathy on their <lb/>
              part with the beleaguered Messenians, <lb/>
              took the earliest opportunity of dis­ <lb/>
              pensing with their services : a proceed­ <lb/>

            coat but a white face. That the Spartan <lb/>
            military uniform was of a red colour we <lb/>
            have seen in the Commentary on Ach. <lb/>
            320. Here the colour of his uniform is <lb/>
            contrasted with the colour of his cheeks <lb/>
            which were pallid (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ὠχρὸς</foreign>) from fear. <lb/>
            The Lacedaemonians were thoroughly <lb/>
            alarmed, but of course the description <lb/>
            of Pericleidas is a mere comic exaggera­ <lb/>
            tion.</p>

            earthquakes, and the violation of whose <lb/>
            sanctuary at Taenarum was supposed <lb/>
            to have provoked the earthquake of <lb/>
            464 B. c. See the Commentary on Ach. <lb/>
            510.</p>
          <p>1145. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ταυτὶ παθόντες</foreign>] The 4,000 men <lb/>
            whom Cimon led to Ithome were not <lb/>
            all Athenian citizens. The gallant little <lb/>
            town of Plataea, always identifying it­ <lb/>
            self with the great Ionian city, sent no <lb/>
            less than a third of its numbers to assist <lb/>
            the Lacedaemonians in their straits. <lb/>
            And thirty-seven years afterwards in <lb/>
            their mock trial before the Spartans, the <lb/>
            Plataeans, pleading for their lives, <lb/>
            appeal not only to their heroism in the <lb/>
            Persian wars, but also, just as Lysistrata <lb/>
            does here, to the succour they gave the <lb/>
            Spartans at the present conjuncture. <lb/>

            to let you off. The charges which she <lb/>
            had brought against the Lacedaemo­ <lb/>
            nians had made the Athenians jump <lb/>
            to the conclusion that they themselves <lb/>
            were in no way to blame. Now there­ <lb/>
            fore she turns to them.</p>
          <p>1150. <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐκ ἴσθ᾽ ὅθ᾽ ὑμᾶς</foreign>] The proof she <lb/>
            adduced of the Athenian friendship for <lb/>
            Sparta was the assistance they gave her <lb/>
            in the siege of Ithome: the proof of the <lb/>
            Spartan friendship for Athens is the <lb/>
            assistance they gave her in completing <lb/>
            the work of Harmodius and Aristogeiton <lb/>
            and expelling the last of the Tyrants. <lb/>
            Yet in this case, as in the former, the <lb/>
            friendly act had a very unsatisfactory <lb/>
            sequel. The expulsion of the Peisistra­ <lb/>
            tidae is described in much the same <lb/>
            way by Herodotus (v. 63-5) and Ari­ <lb/>
            stotle (Polity of Athens, chap. 19). The <lb/>
            Lacedaemonians, constantly urged by <lb/>
            the Pythian oracle <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὰς ᾽Αθήνας ἐλευθε­ <lb/>
            ροῦν</foreign>, first sent by sea a body of troops <lb/>
            under Anchimolius for that purpose. <lb/>
            Anchimolius was defeated and slain by <lb/>
            the Thessalian cavalry, 1,000 in num­ <lb/>
            ber, in the pay of Hippias. Thereupon <lb/>
            Cleomenes led a larger force by land, <lb/>
            defeated the Thessalian cavalry, and <lb/>
            besieged Hippias in the Acropolis. By <lb/>
            a happy stroke of good fortune, the <lb/>
            besiegers captured the children of <lb/>
            Hippias, who thereupon, to save his <lb/>
            children, agreed to leave Attica forth­ <lb/>
            with. Yet very shortly afterwards Cleo­ <lb/>
            menes was himself besieged in the <lb/>
            Acropolis by the Athenian people, with <lb/>
            the result mentioned supra 273-82.</p>
          <p>1151. <foreign xml:lang="grc">κατωνάκας</foreign>] The <foreign xml:lang="grc">κατωνάκη</foreign> was a <lb/>
            thick woollen garment, mostly worn by <lb/>
            slaves (cf. Eccl. 724), the lower part <lb/>
            being composed of sheepskin (<foreign xml:lang="grc">νάκη</foreign>) <lb/>
            whence it derived its name. Lysistrata <lb/>
            speaks as if under the Peisistratidae all <lb/>
            Athenians were compelled to wear this <lb/>
            servile dress, which is quite incredible; <lb/>
            so tyrannical an edict could not have <lb/>
            escaped the notice of Herodotus and <lb/>
            other ancient writers. And we know <lb/>
            from Theopompus that the necessity <lb/>
            was imposed only upon certain returned <lb/>
            exiles who were permitted to dwell in <pb n="136"/>
            <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BELL_07_fig265.jpg"/></figure> <lb/>
              Attica, but not to enter the city, and <lb/>
              who wore this distinctive badge that <lb/>
              they might not slip in unnoticed. <lb/>
              Moeris, who introduces the word <foreign xml:lang="grc">κατω­ <lb/>
              νάκη</foreign>, apparently without any reason, <lb/>
              into his Attic and Hellenic words," <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BELL_07_fig266.jpg"/></figure> <lb/>
              <foreign xml:lang="grc">νάκην φορεῖν</foreign>. But other writers are not <lb/>
              so careful and, probably from taking <lb/>
              Lysistrata's words too literally, declare <lb/>
              that the " Tyrants " did really compel <lb/>
              the Athenians generally to wear the <lb/>
              <foreign xml:lang="grc">κατωνάκη</foreign>. Thus Pollux (vii. 68) says, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἡ</foreign> <figure type="illustration">

              <foreign xml:lang="grc">εἰς ἄστυ κατιέναι</foreign>. And so, omitting the <lb/>
              reference to the Sicyonian <foreign xml:lang="grc">κατωνακοφόροι</foreign>, <lb/>
              Hesychius and Suidas s.v. No doubt <lb/>
              many of the exiles would be men of <lb/>
              position and substance who, if they <lb/>
              elected to return to Attica, would have <lb/>
              to assume the servile <foreign xml:lang="grc">κατωνάκη</foreign>.</p>
          <p>1155. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀντὶ τῆς κατωνάκης</foreign>] In some­ <lb/>
            what similar language, Arrian tells us, <lb/>
            Alexander the Great pointed out to <lb/>
            his Macedonians the benefits which his <lb/>
            father had conferred upon them. <foreign xml:lang="grc">χλα­ <lb/>

            We at all events are willing (to make <lb/>
            friends) if we can get the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἔγκυκλον</foreign> restored <lb/>
            to its. The desire of recovering their lost <lb/>
            possessions is for the moment merged in <lb/>
            their love for Lysistrata, and their reci­ <lb/>
            procal demands are throughout worded <lb/>
            with reference to her dress and person. <lb/>
            The restoration of Pylus had been for <lb/>
            years so paramount an object to the Lace­ <lb/>
            daemonians that Aristophanes could not <lb/>
            but make it their demand here also, but <lb/>
            lie diverts it to Lysistrata by calling it <lb/>
            the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἔγκυκλον</foreign> which, as regards her, means <pb n="137"/>

              Athenians, however, the poet's fancy <lb/>
              was more unrestricted, and he selects <lb/>
              just those names as will best apply to <lb/>
              Lysistrata; Echinus (<foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸ γυναικεῖοναἰδοῖον</foreign>), <lb/>

            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἧσπερ</foreign>. Notwithstanding their misfor­ <lb/>
            tunes, the Athenians were still keeping <lb/>
            a firm grip upon Pylus (supra 104); and <lb/>
            its recapture, though not of such abso­ <lb/>
            lutely vital necessity to Sparta as it had <lb/>
            seemed ten years before (Peace 219), was <lb/>
            still a matter of the greatest importance; <lb/>
            and two years after the date of the <lb/>
            Lysistrata, we find the Spartans besieg­ <lb/>
            ing it both by land and by sea. But <lb/>
            the besieging fleet consisted of eleven <lb/>
            triremes only, and the Athenians dis­ <lb/>
            patched a fleet of thirty ships under <lb/>
            Anytus (afterwards the accuser of Socra­ <lb/>
            tes) to relieve the town. Anytus failed <lb/>
            to round Cape Malea, and returned to <lb/>
            Athens having effected nothing, and <lb/>
            leaving Pylus to its fate. He was brought <lb/>
            to trial for treason (<foreign xml:lang="grc">προδοσία</foreign>), and only <lb/>
            escaped by bribing the dicasts; Dio­ <lb/>
            dorus Siculus xiii. 64 ; Polity of Athens, <lb/>
            chap. 27. So Pylus, having been in <lb/>
            the hands of the Athenians for fifteen <lb/>
            years, passed again into the possession <lb/>
            of Sparta.</p>
          <p>1165. <foreign xml:lang="grc">Ποσειδῶ</foreign>] He appeals to Posei­ <lb/>
            don because by means of the sea the <lb/>
            Athenians first obtained possession of <lb/>
            Pylus, and by the same means only can <lb/>
            they retain it. By <foreign xml:lang="grc">τοῦτο μέν γ᾽οὐ δράσετε</foreign>, <lb/>
            ye won’t do that, he means "you won't <lb/>
            get Pylus."</p>
          <p>1166. <foreign xml:lang="grc">κινήσομεν</foreign>] As regards Pylus, this <lb/>
            refers to the opportunities which its <lb/>
            possession gave to Athens of stirring <lb/>
            up troubles and risings amongst the <lb/>
            Messenians. As regards Lysistrata, the <lb/>
            word is used <foreign xml:lang="grc">πρὸς τὸ κακέμφατον</foreign>.</p>
          <p>1168. <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸ δεῖνα</foreign>] See on 921 supra. He <lb/>
            is humming and hawing as though un­ <lb/>
            able to decide offhand what places he <lb/>
            will demand in exchange for Pylus. The <lb/>
            word <foreign xml:lang="grc">τουτονὶ</foreign> at the end of the line shows <pb n="138"/>
            <figure type="illustration">

              that when he does name them he <lb/>
              also points them out on Lysistrata's <lb/>
              person.</p>
          <p>1169. <foreign xml:lang="grc">Έχινου̑ντα κ.τ.λ</foreign>.] The places are <lb/>
            selected, not on their own account, but <lb/>
            solely from the applicability of their <lb/>
            names to the person of Lysistrata ; and <lb/>
            Paulmier's speculations as to the histori­ <lb/>
            cal reasons which made the speaker <lb/>
            demand them, however ingenious, are <lb/>
            altogether misplaced. Under cover <lb/>
            of these names the Athenian is really <lb/>
            endeavouring to possess himself of the <lb/>
            lower half of Lysistrata's person; an <lb/>
            unexpectedly large demand which the <lb/>
            Laconian indignantly describes as want­ <lb/>
            ing EVERYTHING. Such a description <lb/>
            would have been absurd if it were in­ <lb/>
            tended to refer merely to the three insig­ <lb/>
            nificant places mentioned. Echinus was <lb/>
            a town on the Maliac bay, the bay <lb/>
            which came up to the east of the pass <lb/>
            of Thermopylae. The bay was, of course, <lb/>
            in front of Echinus, and both Scho­ <lb/>
            liast and Commentators have puzzled <lb/>
            themselves over the words <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸν ὄπισθεν</foreign>, <lb/>
            the Scholiast suggesting that there was <lb/>
            a lake at the back of the town, and some <lb/>
            of the Commentators supposing that a <lb/>
            creek from the bay ran up into its rear. <lb/>
            But all this is mere trifling. In my <lb/>
            judgement the words have nothing to <lb/>
            do with the town, but apply exclusively <lb/>
            to Lysistrata's person. The speaker <lb/>
            could not help using the word <foreign xml:lang="grc">κόλπος</foreign>, <lb/>
            because everybody called the bay <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸν <lb/>
            Μηλια̑ κόλπον</foreign> (Aesch. Persae 488, Hdt. <lb/>
            iv. 33); but he means it to represent not <lb/>
            her bosom, but her <foreign xml:lang="grc">πρωκτὸς</foreign> (supra 1148) ; <lb/>
            and to make this quite clear he calls it <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸν κόλπον τὸν ὄπισθεν</foreign>. The <foreign xml:lang="grc">Μεγαρικά <lb/>
            σκέλη</foreign> are the Long Walls which con­ <lb/>
            nected the town of Megara with its port <lb/>
            of Nisaea. These walls had been erected <lb/>
            by the Athenians nearly half a century <lb/>
            before the date of the Lysistrata, when <lb/>
            Megara was in close alliance with <lb/>
            Athens (Thuc. i. 103); and were levelled <lb/>
            to the ground by the Megarians them­ <lb/>
            selves during the winter of 424-423 B.C. <lb/>
            (Thuc. iv. 109). Long Walls of this <lb/>
            description went by the name of <foreign xml:lang="grc">σκέλη</foreign>, <lb/>
            legs, <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὰ μακρὰ σκέλη</foreign> ; and that is the sole <lb/>
            reason of their mention here: they <pb n="139"/>

              Athenian was anxious to obtain.</p>

            naturally indignant that, whilst his own <lb/>
            modest demand was confined to one ar­ <lb/>
            ticle of Lysistrata's raiment, the Athenian <lb/>
            should be demanding half her person.</p>
          <p>1173. <foreign xml:lang="grc">γυμνός</foreign>] Bergler refers to Virgil's <lb/>
            well-known precept Nudus ara, sere nu­ <lb/>
            dus (Georg. i. 299), the commencement <lb/>
            of a line which (when Virgil was reciting <lb/>
            his poem) some Roman wag completed <lb/>
            by ejaculating habebis frigora, febrem. <lb/>
            But of course Virgil was merely trans­ <lb/>
            lating Hesiod's <foreign xml:lang="grc">γυμνὸν σπείρειν, γυμνὸν δὲ <lb/>
            βοωτει̑ν, Γυμνὸν</foreign> 8' <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀμα̑σθαι</foreign>, W. and D. <lb/>
            391. The Scholiast's explanation of the <lb/>
            present line is <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀπαλλαγεὶς του̑ πολέμου <lb/>
            γυμνὸς βούλομαι γεωργεῖν</foreign>, and of the next <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀντὶ του̑ κόπρον ἄγειν πρω̑τον ὡς μὴ εὐπο­ <lb/>
            ρούντων αὐτω̑ν ἀροσίμης γη̑ς</foreign>. They were <lb/>
            like the Athenian allies after the ter­ <lb/>
            mination of the Persian wars, who are <lb/>
            described by Plutarch (Cimon, chap. 11) <lb/>
            as <foreign xml:lang="grc">πολέμου μὲν οὐδὲν δεόμενοι, γεωργεῖν <lb/>
            δὲ</foreign> Kal <foreign xml:lang="grc">ξη̑ν</foreign> Ka6' <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἡσυχίαν ἐπιθυμου̑ντες</foreign>. But <lb/>
            doubtless in both these lines there is an <lb/>
            allusion to the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀρώσιμοι γύαι</foreign> of which <lb/>
            Sophocles speaks in Antigone 569. <lb/>
            Lysistrata, naturally, ignores the in­ <lb/>
            nuendo, and, in her reply, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ταυ̑τα</foreign> merely <lb/>
            means, as the Scholiast says, <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὰ τη̑ς <lb/>

            Laconians. But the old Acharnians, <lb/>
            who were the speakers there, were <lb/>
            the representatives of the War-party. <lb/>
            Lysistrata is the protagonist of the <lb/>
            Peace-party; and she agrees with Di­ <lb/>
            caeopolis that the Laconians were not <lb/>

            to partake of the promised entertain­ <lb/>

            bassadors returning from the banquet <lb/>
            in a very friendly and convivial mood, <lb/>
            and enlivening the remainder of the <lb/>
            Play with a succession of songs and <lb/>
            dances. The Chorus take advantage of <lb/>
            their absence to continue the series of <lb/>
            stanzas which they commenced supra <lb/>
            1043-71. The Scholiast says that these <lb/>
            two stanzas are an <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀποκοπὴ</foreign> rod <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἄλλου <lb/>
            χορου̑</foreign>, meaning that the four stanzas <lb/>
            form one connected whole, and that <lb/>
            the present pair are merely a section <lb/>
            of that whole. They are linked on to <lb/>
            the former pair by the particle <foreign xml:lang="grc">δέ</foreign>. The <lb/>
            third stanza opens with a free offer to <lb/>
            the audience of valuable ornaments and <lb/>
            splendid attire. <foreign xml:lang="grc">Στρώματα ποικίλα</foreign> are <lb/>
            embroidered coverlets to be spread over <lb/>

            woollen mantles worn by both men and <lb/>
            women. The diminutive is probably <lb/>
            used to denote their preciousness rather <lb/>
            than their size. That the <foreign xml:lang="grc">χλανὶς</foreign> was <lb/>
            considered an elegant and fashionable <lb/>

            a little squabble between the Porter and <lb/>
            some idle fellows crowding about the <lb/>
            door, which may remind the English <lb/>
            reader of the Porter-scene in Shake­ <lb/>
            speare's Henry the Eighth v. 3. The <lb/>
            Aristophanic Porter-scene appears to be <lb/>
            a satire on the artifices employed by <lb/>
            contemporary dramatists to elicit the <lb/>
            laughter of the audience. A group of <lb/>
            idlers approach from the market-place, <lb/>
            and propose to join the banqueters <lb/>
            within. One of them hails the Porter, <lb/>
            and calls on him to open the door. The <lb/>
            Porter orders him off. Thereupon the <lb/>
            intruder threatens to set fire with his <lb/>
            torch to the Porter and his assistants. <lb/>
            Doubtless this had been done in the <lb/>
            scene satirized. But the Aristophanic <lb/>
            idler draws back, and says that this is a <lb/>
            vulgar trick and he won't do it. Never­ <lb/>
            theless, on second thoughts, if the audi­ <lb/>

              come out, and the Porter drives the <lb/>
              whole group of idlers from the door. <lb/>
              The scene is variously arranged. I ad­ <lb/>
              here to the arrangement adopted in the <lb/>

            πρα̑γμα, τὸὑμα̑ς καυ̑σαι</foreign>. To set fire to <lb/>
            the Porter, he means, is a low and vul­ <lb/>

            other of what has occurred within. But <lb/>
            all the idlers are Athenians, and the <lb/>
            Porter specially refers to the Laconians <lb/>
            because they are the visitors and must be <lb/>
            treated with respect.</p>

            back differing tales as to what had <lb/>

          <p>1237. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἄδοι Τελαμῶνος</foreign>] sing the Telamon <lb/>
            catch. We have seen in the Commentary <lb/>
            on Wasps 1222 the principle on which <lb/>
            scolia were sung at an Athenian sym­ <lb/>
            posium, a principle admirably expounded <lb/>
            and illustrated by Colonel Mure, Greek <lb/>
            Literature iii. 2. 13. As the lyre, sprig <lb/>
            of myrtle, scolium-cup (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ῴδὸς</foreign>), or other <lb/>
            badge of minstrelsy was passed on from <lb/>
            one guest to another, the recipient for <lb/>
            the time being was expected to cap the <lb/>
            scolium sung by the previous holder, <lb/>
            that is to say, to sing a scolium which <lb/>
            should be linked on to the former by <lb/>
            some catchword, similarity of thought, <lb/>
            or the like. In the present case we are <lb/>
            to suppose that the preceding scolium <lb/>
            was one which could be properly capped <lb/>
            only by some such catch as the Cleita­ <lb/>
            gora scolium, a part of which (being all <lb/>
            we know of it) is given in Wasps 1245, &amp;c. <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BELL_07_fig277.jpg"/></figure> <lb/>
              But instead of singing this, or any <lb/>
              scolium of a similar character, the <lb/>
              recipient, perhaps a little overcome by <lb/>
              wine, trolls out the irrelevant Telamon <lb/>
              catch, which is given in Athenaeus xv. <lb/>
              50, and runs as follows :— <figure type="illustration">

              On an ordinary occasion such a blunder <lb/>
              would have exposed the singer to deri­ <lb/>
              sion, but in their present state of con­ <lb/>
              viviality and friendship it merely evokes <lb/>
              a kindly approval. As to the Cleitagora <lb/>

            absurdly attributed to a <foreign xml:lang="grc">χορὸς Λακώνων</foreign> <lb/>
            by some if not all of the MSS. There was <lb/>
            not, and indeed could not have been, <lb/>
            any " Chorus of Laconians." For whence <lb/>

            only Chorus in the Play consists of <lb/>
            the twelve Athenian men and twelve <lb/>
            Athenian women now acting together, <lb/>
            but formerly composing two hostile <lb/>
            Semichoruses. There was no place in <lb/>
            the orchestra or on the stage for any <lb/>
            other Chorus, and the error in the <lb/>
            ascription of the final song should have <lb/>
            been rectified from the unanimity with <lb/>
            which the present one is ascribed to <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">Λάκων</foreign> or <foreign xml:lang="grc">Πρέσβυς</foreign>. But a different course <lb/>
            has prevailed; and Dindorf and some <lb/>
            other recent editors have intensified the <lb/>
            error by attributing the present song <lb/>

          <p>1257. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὰφρὸς ἤνσει</foreign>] Thefoam blossomed <lb/>
            (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἤνθει</foreign>), that is, burst forth like a white <lb/>
            flower. The picture of the wild boar <lb/>
            churning the white foam between his <lb/>
            jaws " is very familiar in both ancient <lb/>
            and modern literature. Here the foam is <lb/>
            described not only as gathering round <lb/>
            the jaws, but also as streaming down <lb/>
            the forelegs of the animal, <foreign xml:lang="grc">καττῶν</foreign> for <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">κατὰ τῶν</foreign>. The use of the sigma where <lb/>
            the Attics used theta, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἤνσει</foreign> for <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἤνθει</foreign>, was <lb/>
            very common with the Dorians: we <lb/>
            have in this ode <foreign xml:lang="grc">σηροκτόνε</foreign> for <foreign xml:lang="grc">θηροκτόνε, <lb/>
            παρσένε</foreign> for <foreign xml:lang="grc">παρθένε, σιὰ</foreign> for <foreign xml:lang="grc">θεά</foreign>.</p>

          <p>1269. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀλωπέκων</foreign>] In Peace 1067 the <lb/>
            Oracle-monger compares the Spartans <lb/>
            as contrasted with the Athenians, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀλωπε­ <lb/>
            κιδεῦσιν</foreign> I <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὦν δόλιαι ψυχαὶ, δόλιαι φρένες</foreign>. <lb/>
            And probably the word is here also <lb/>
            intended specially for the Spartans, <lb/>
            though in terms it extends to all the <lb/>
            contracting parties. The epithet <foreign xml:lang="grc">αἱμι­ <lb/>
            λᾶν</foreign>, false, shifty, deceitful, is equivalent to <lb/>
            the <foreign xml:lang="grc">δόλιαι</foreign> of the earlier comedy. The <lb/>
            Scholiast's explanation of <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀλωπέκων</foreign> by <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">τῶν πανούργων ῥητόρων</foreign> seems altogether <lb/>

          <p>1272. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἄγε νυν</foreign>] Lysistrata may possibly <lb/>
            have come out with the envoys, but it <lb/>
            is more probable that she lingered <lb/>
            behind them for a few moments and <lb/>
            only now reappears to wind up the <lb/>
            proceedings. With her emerge both her <lb/>
            own young and beautiful comrades and <lb/>
            also the ladies of the Peloponnesian <lb/>
            party who entered the Acropolis as <lb/>
            hostages supra 244. The latter are the <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ταύτας</foreign> whom the Laconians are to lead <lb/>
            out to the dance : the former the <foreign xml:lang="grc">τάσδε</foreign> <lb/>
            whom the Athenians are to partner.</p>
          <p>1276. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπ᾽ ἀγαθαῖς συμφοραῖς</foreign> in honour <lb/>
            of our good fortune. See the Commen­ <lb/>
            tary on Knights 406.</p>
          <p>1279. <foreign xml:lang="grc">πρόσαγε δὴ χορόν</foreign>] Although <lb/>
            the Laconian songs are sung by the <lb/>
            Laconian on the stage, yet the Athenian <lb/>
            song is unquestionably sung by the full <lb/>
            Chorus dancing in the orchestra, whilst <lb/>
            the actors are dancing on the stage. <lb/>
            This is plain not merely from the open­ <lb/>
            ing words <foreign xml:lang="grc">πρόσαγε</foreign> xopov, but still more <lb/>
            from the general tone and metrical <lb/>
            arrangement of the song itself. The <lb/>
            Chorus invoke the Gods to be present at <lb/>
            the joyous festival of Peace, and to wit­ <lb/>
            ness the solemnities with which it is <lb/>
            inaugurated. And first they summon <lb/>
            the two great Dorian deities, Apollo and <lb/>
            Artemis, and with them the Graces, the <lb/>
            constant choir-companions of the God­ <lb/>
            dess. " For when Artemis has finished <lb/>
            with the chase," sings the author of the <lb/>
            Homeric Hymn in her honour, "she goes <lb/>
            to the splendid home of her dear brother <lb/>
            at Delphi, there to arrange the goodly <lb/>
            dance of the Muses and the Graces,<figure type="illustration">

              And she herself, hanging up her quiver <lb/>
              and her bow, and robing herself in fair <lb/>
              raiment, leads off the dance."</p>
          <p>1280. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπὶ δὲ κάλεσον</foreign>] This division of <lb/>
            the verb <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπικάλεσον</foreign> enables the poet <lb/>
            with more lucidity to employ the pre­ <lb/>
            position <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπὶ</foreign> alone in the following verses <lb/>
            in the sense of <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπικάλεσον</foreign>. For <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπὶ</foreign> stands <lb/>

            of his golden lyre (Birds 219, 220, and <lb/>
            the Commentary there). He is also the <lb/>
            kindly Healer, for that is the meaning <lb/>
            of <foreign xml:lang="grc">᾽Ιήιος</foreign>, whether the title is more <lb/>
            directly connected with <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἰάομαι</foreign> or with <lb/>

          <p>1283. <foreign xml:lang="grc">Νύσιον</foreign>] As to this epithet of <lb/>
            Dionysus see Frogs 215 and the note <lb/>
            there.</p>
          <p>1284. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὄμμασι δαίεται</foreign>] If these words <lb/>
            are correct they can only mean is afire <lb/>
            with his eyes, sparkles fire from his eyes. <lb/>
            In Odyssey vi. 131 Homer says of a lion <lb/>
            iv <foreign xml:lang="grc">δέ οἱ ὄσσε δαίεται</foreign>, which Eustathius <lb/>

            Apollo and Artemis ; and Dionysus the <lb/>
            Lord of the festival at which they are <lb/>
            all assisting. And they now invoke <lb/>
            Zeus and Hera, the King and Queen of <lb/>
            the Gods; just as in the great dance- <lb/>
            song in the Thesmophoriazusae, the <lb/>
            women, after invoking Apollo and <lb/>
            Artemis, go on to invoke " the matron <lb/>
            Hera" (Thesm. 969-76); the invoca­ <lb/>
            tion of Dionysus being there reserved to <lb/>
            the closing stanzas of the ode. The <lb/>
            phrase <foreign xml:lang="grc">πυρὶ φλεγόμενον</foreign> is explained by <lb/>
            the Scholiast to mean <foreign xml:lang="grc">φλέγοντα διὰ τῶν <lb/>
            κεραυνῶν</foreign>.</p>
          <p>1287. <foreign xml:lang="grc">δαίμονς</foreign>] The Scholiast's explana­ <lb/>
            tion, <foreign xml:lang="grc">καὶ τοὺς ἰίλλους θεοὺς κάλεσον</foreign>, <lb/>
            though accepted without demur by all <lb/>
            the Commentators, quite misses the <lb/>
            point. The Chorus are referring to <lb/>
            those secondary Powers whose special <lb/>
            business it is to witness the conclusion <lb/>
            of a treaty and to punish its infraction. <lb/>
            The term <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπίμαρτυς</foreign> is borrowed from <lb/>
            Homer's Z<foreign xml:lang="grc">εὺς δ᾽ ἰίμμ᾽ ἐπιμάρτυρος ἔστω</foreign> in <lb/>
            the compact which preceded the single <lb/>
            combat of Hector and Aias. And the <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">δαίμονες</foreign> are borrowed from the more <lb/>
            important compact which preceded the <lb/>
            single combat of Paris and Menelaus.</p><figure type="illustration">

            specially in his mind the Sun, the Rivers, <lb/>
            the Earth, and the Powers under the <lb/>
            earth. He uses a general term to <lb/>
            include all those deities whose particular <lb/>

          <p>1290. <foreign xml:lang="grc">κύπρις</foreign>] That the success of the <lb/>
            Women in bringing about a peace is due <lb/>
            to the influence of Aphrodite the God­ <lb/>
            dess of Love is of course obvious, and is <lb/>
            indeed recognized throughout the pre­ <lb/>
            liminary struggle. Cf. supra 551, 833. <lb/>
            Peace is here called <foreign xml:lang="grc">Ἡσυχία</foreign> since neither <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">Εἰρήνη</foreign> nor <foreign xml:lang="grc">Διαλλαγὴ</foreign> could be brought <lb/>
            into these dactylics ; and is described as <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">μεγαλόφρων</foreign>, great-minded, because there <lb/>
            has been no defeat or surrender on either <lb/>
            side; Athens and Sparta were alike <lb/>
            eager to make it, and are equally satis­ <lb/>
            fied with its terms. <foreign xml:lang="grc">Ἡσυχία</foreign> is styled <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀγανόφρων</foreign> in Birds 1321, and <foreign xml:lang="grc">φιλόφρων</foreign> <lb/>
            in the eighth Pythian.</p>
          <p>1292. <foreign xml:lang="grc">αἴρσθ᾽ ἄνω</foreign>] Lift up your feet in <lb/>
            the dance. We have seen at the com­ <lb/>
            mencement of this Play how closely the <lb/>
            position of Lysistrata there resembles <lb/>
            the position of Praxagora at the com­ <lb/>
            mencement of the Ecclesiazusae; and <lb/>
            these final ejaculations of the Chorus <lb/>
            here are repeated, with very little varia­ <lb/>
            tion, as the final ejaculations of the <lb/>
            Chorus in the later Comedy. These <lb/>
            cries of victory are intended, not merely <lb/>
            to celebrate the triumph of Lysistrata <lb/>
            and her friends, but also to prognosticate <lb/>
            the success of Aristophanes in the thea­ <lb/>
            trical contest; and the phrase <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὡς ἐπὶ νίκῃ</foreign>, <lb/>
            used both here and in the Ecclesiazusae, <lb/>
            would naturally direct the minds of the <lb/>
            audience to the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπινίκια</foreign> by which that <lb/>
            success would be followed.</p>
          <p>1295. <foreign xml:lang="grc">πρόφαινε κ.τ.λ</foreign>.] The Laconian <lb/>
            will sing a new song in return for that <lb/>
            which the Chorus have sung, and he is <lb/>
            here calling upon the piper, just as he <lb/>
            did supra 1242, to play the accompani­ <lb/>
            ment while he is singing. In the MSS. <lb/>
            and editions the word <foreign xml:lang="grc">Λάκων</foreign> is made a <lb/>
            part of the line (so rendering it a foot <lb/>
            too long), and the speaker is supposed to <lb/>
            be either the Coryphaeus or Lysistrata. <lb/>
            And so I have left it in the translation. <lb/>
            But if we take <foreign xml:lang="grc">Λάκων</foreign> to designate the <lb/>
            speaker everything is right.</p>
          <p>1297. <foreign xml:lang="grc">Ταΰγετον</foreign>] The piper begins his <lb/>
            accompaniment, and the Laconian <lb/>
            begins his song. He invites the Laco­ <lb/>
            nian Muse to quit the pleasant glades of <lb/>
            Taygetus, and come to the Athenian <lb/>
            acropolis; there to sing the praises of <lb/>
            Apollo, the far-famed God of Amyclae. <lb/>
            For Amyclae was the chief seat, in <lb/>
            Laconia, of Apollo's worship, the place <lb/>
            where the great festivals, the Hyacinthia <lb/>
            and the Carneia, were celebrated in his <lb/>
            honour. There too she will sing the <lb/>
            praises of Athene of the Bronze House, <lb/>
            and of the gracious Tyndarids (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀγασὼς</foreign> <pb n="151"/>

              Eurotas.</p>
          <p>1300. <foreign xml:lang="grc">χαλκίοικον ᾽Ασάναν</foreign>] Athene of the <lb/>
            Bronze House, whom Pausanias identifies <lb/>
            with <foreign xml:lang="grc">᾽Αθήνη Πολιοῦχος</foreign>. Her famous <lb/>
            temple ("templum aereum" Livy xxxv. <lb/>
            36) stood on the hill which formed the <lb/>
            Acropolis of Sparta, Pausanias iii. 17. <lb/>
            3. It was the centre around which <lb/>
            gathered a multitude of interesting <lb/>
            reminiscences. Here it was that the <lb/>
            gallant Aristomenes, the hero of <lb/>
            Messenia, entering Sparta secretly in <lb/>
            the night time, hung up a shield with <lb/>
            the defiant inscription Aristomenes dedi­ <lb/>
            cates to the Goddess these Spartan spoils, <lb/>
            Pausanias iv. 15. 2. Here it was that <lb/>
            Pausanias, the commander of the Helle­ <lb/>
            nic armies at Plataea, took refuge and was <lb/>
            starved, Thuc. i. 134. Indeed it seems <lb/>
            to have been the ordinary sanctuary for <lb/>
            Spartan kings, Plutarch, Agis 11 and <lb/>
            16. Here Agesilaus was offering a <lb/>
            sacrifice when he was bitten by a louse. <lb/>
            He caught and killed it before the <lb/>
            crowd, exclaiming Yea, by Heaven, a <lb/>
            treacherous plotter, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπίβουλον</foreign>, I will gladly <lb/>
            slay even before Athene's altar, Plutarch <lb/>
            (Apothegm. Lac. Agesilaus 8). Here <lb/>
            too Archidamus the king who, at the <lb/>
            commencement of the Peloponnesian <lb/>
            War, led the army of invasion into <lb/>
            Attica, brought two friends who had <lb/>
            quarrelled and were willing to refer <lb/>
            their differences to him, and after making <lb/>
            them swear to abide by his decision <lb/>
            (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐμμεῖναι τοῖς κριθεῖς</foreign>) he said My decision <lb/>
            is that you do not leave this sanctuary <lb/>
            before you shake hands and make up (Id. <lb/>
            Archidamus, Zeuxidami f. 6). And the <lb/>
            same writer, in his treatise on Garrulity <lb/>
            (14), observing that no considerations <lb/>
            of prudence will induce a true gossip to <lb/>
            hold his tongue, tells us that once a <lb/>
            robbery was committed in this House <lb/>
            of Bronze, and an empty wine-flask was <lb/>
            found lying on the floor. Whilst the <lb/>
            crowd were wondering what the flask <lb/>
            could mean, one of them said, " I'll tell <lb/>
            you what I think; I'll be bound that <lb/>
            the thieves had taken hemlock, so that <lb/>
            if they were caught they might die <lb/>
            before they could be tortured; while <lb/>
            if they got safely off, they would drink <lb/>
            the wine and neutralize the poison." <lb/>
            " Why, this is not guessing ! " cried the <lb/>
            bystanders, " YOU KNOW ! You are one <lb/>
            of them yourself." And so it proved. <lb/>
            The Bronze Temple of Athene is twice <lb/>
            mentioned in the "Helen," a Tragedy <lb/>

              present Comedy. See the Introduction to <lb/>
              the Thesmophoriazusae. Its site has been <lb/>
              recently uncovered, but nothing of im­ <lb/>
              portance has, I believe, been found there.</p>
          <p>1303. <foreign xml:lang="grc">εἶα μάλ᾽ ἔμβη</foreign>] Hitherto the singer <lb/>
            has been addressing the Muse ; he now <lb/>
            turns to his comrades dancing on the <lb/>
            stage. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἔμβη</foreign> is the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἔμβα</foreign> of Frogs 378, <lb/>
            Eccl. 478.</p>
          <p>1304. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὤια κοῦφα πάλλων</foreign>] Lightly swing­ <lb/>
            ing your sheepskins. The lower part <lb/>
            of a Spartan robe was trimmed with <lb/>
            sheepskin or wool. In Wasps 475 an <lb/>
            Athenian accused of Laconizing is said <lb/>
            to wear <foreign xml:lang="grc">κράσπεδα στεμμάτων</foreign>, and the <lb/>
            Scholiast observes <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐκ στεμμάτων ἀντὶ τοῦ <lb/>

            of the best MSS. and all the older editors; <lb/>
            recent editors have adopted the reading <lb/>
            of the inferior MSS. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὦ εἶα κοῦφα πάλλων</foreign>, <lb/>
            an excellent reading in itself, but, with <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">εἶα</foreign> in the preceding line, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὦ εἶα</foreign> is far <lb/>
            more likely to have been substituted <lb/>
            for, than to have been superseded by, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὤια</foreign>. <lb/>
            Apparently there was a neuter nomina­ <lb/>
            tive <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὤιον</foreign>, as well as a feminine <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὠία</foreign>.</p>
          <p>1306. <foreign xml:lang="grc">τᾷ σιῶν χοροί</foreign>] <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἧ̜ θεῶν χοροί</foreign>. <lb/>
            For in old times the Dorians were the <lb/>
            chief promoters of music and the dance ; <lb/>
            and the Dorian mode was, it has often <lb/>
            been observed, the only one of the three <lb/>
            original modes which derived its name <lb/>
            from a Greek people, the others being <lb/>
            the Phrygian and the Lydian. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ποδῶν <lb/>
            κτύπος</foreign> means the clatter of dancing feet.</p>
          <p>1308. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ᾇ τε πῶλοι</foreign>] And the maidens, like <lb/>
            fillies, beside Eurotas twinkle to and fro <lb/>
            with active nimble feet; and their tresses <lb/>
            are waving as they go, like the tresses of <lb/>
            Bacchanals sporting and flourishing their <lb/>
            thyrsus-wands. The Bacchanals are com­ <lb/>
            pared to fillies, <foreign xml:lang="grc">πώλοις</foreign>, in Eur. Bacchae <lb/>
            163 and 1056. Here <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀμπάλλοντι</foreign> is used <lb/>
            intransitively; in Frogs 1357 it is tran­ <lb/>
            sitive <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὰ κῶλά τ᾽ ἀμπάλλετε</foreign>. In Attic the <lb/>
            participle which follows would be <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐγκο­ <lb/>
            νοῦσαι</foreign>, Ach. 1088, Wasps 240, Birds 1324, <lb/>

            leads them on, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἡγεῖται</foreign>. The epithet <foreign xml:lang="grc">άγνὰ</foreign> <lb/>
            is specially selected to make it clear <lb/>
            that this is not the sinful Helen of her <lb/>
            earthly days, but the purified Helen of <lb/>
            the Elysian fields. Some would change <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">Λήδας</foreign> into <foreign xml:lang="grc">Λατοῦς</foreign> and so make Artemis <lb/>
            the Chorus-leader; but it is impossible <lb/>
            to disregard the united authority of all <lb/>
            the MSS.; and it is perhaps more fitting <lb/>
            that this dance of Spartan women should <lb/>
            be led by the daughter of Zeus who was <lb/>
            herself a Spartan woman.</p>
          <p>1316. <foreign xml:lang="grc">παραμπύκιδδε</foreign>] <foreign xml:lang="grc">παραμπυκίζειν</foreign> <lb/>
            properly means to confine the hair with <lb/>
            an <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἄμπυξ</foreign>, a hair-band, but here, as they <lb/>
            go dancing along, the woman's own hand <lb/>
            is to act as an <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἄμπυξ</foreign>. Her hand is to <lb/>
            press back her hair, whilst with her feet <lb/>
            she is leaping (<foreign xml:lang="grc">πάδη</foreign> for <foreign xml:lang="grc">πήδα</foreign>) like a deer.</p>
          <p>1319. <foreign xml:lang="grc">χορωφελήταν</foreign>] <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀντὶ τοῦ ποίει κρότον <lb/>
            ὠφελοῦντα τὸν χορόν</foreign>.—Scholiast. They <lb/>
            are to make, either with their hands or <lb/>
            with their feet, the rhythmic sounds <lb/>
            which time the dance.</p>
          <p>1322. <foreign xml:lang="grc">πάμμαχον</foreign>] This is an unusual <lb/>
            word, and is possibly introduced here to <lb/>
            remind the Athenian audience of their <lb/>
            own <foreign xml:lang="grc">Πρόμαχος</foreign> the colossal Champion of <lb/>
            the Athenian acropolis. Indeed some <lb/>
            MSS.,noted for their futile emendations, <lb/>
            go so far as to substitute <foreign xml:lang="grc">Πρόμαχον</foreign> for <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">πάμμαχον</foreign>, forgetting that the former <lb/>
            word would be quite out of place on the <lb/>
            lips of a Spartan, and inconsistent with <lb/>
            the other epithet <foreign xml:lang="grc">χαλκίοικον</foreign>, which shows <lb/>
            that he is specially referring to the <lb/>
            Athene of the Dorian metropolis. <lb/>
            Nevertheless she was the same Athene, <lb/>
            wherever and under whatever name she <lb/>
            was worshipped; and it is noteworthy <lb/>
            that this final song, though emphatically <lb/>
            " In praise of Sparta," is wound up, and <lb/>
            that the Comedy itself concludes, with <lb/>
            the praise of the Goddess who was every­ <lb/>
            where regarded as the special patroness <lb/>
            and protector of Athens.</p>

          </head>
          <p>By the kindness of my friend, the Hon. Mrs. Cardew, I am permitted to append <lb/>
            to this Commentary her presentation of Bion's Adonis-dirge.</p>
          <p>Ah ! weep for fair Adonis-he is dead ! <lb/>
            Ye Loves, weep for him, in his beauty slain. <lb/>
            0 Cypris, sleep no more in purple clad! <lb/>
            Arise, and don thy sable weeds, and cry <lb/>
            “ Lovely Adonis, he hath perished ! " <lb/>
            Woe for Adonis, woe! the Loves lament. <lb/>
            Stricken he lies on the hillside so drear, <lb/>
            His thigh pierced through by cruel wild boar's tusk. <lb/>
            Quietly ebbs his life, and sorrow falls <lb/>
            On Cypris, who so loved him, and was loved! <lb/>
            She kissed him as he died, but he knew not. <lb/>
            The light had left his eyes, so dim and pressed <lb/>
            By Death's too heavy hand beneath the lids; <lb/>
            And the dark blood, slow dripping from the wound, <lb/>
            Stained his white skin, but blanched his pallid lips. <lb/>
            Woe for Adonis, woe! the Loves lament! <lb/>
            His wound was cruel, but in Cypris' heart <lb/>
            The wound is deeper still-deep as her love; <lb/>
            Although a goddess, she can feel Love's pain. <lb/>
            His faithful hounds are baying round his corpse, <lb/>
            While in the wood the nymphs are wailing shrill. <lb/>
            But Aphrodite, with long locks unbound, <lb/>
            Wanders along the glades, her feet unshod. <lb/>
            She calls Adonis with a bitter cry— <lb/>
            Again—“ Adonis, where art thou, my lord ? ” <lb/>
            But he lies silent, answering not her cry, <lb/>
            For his life-blood has ebbed, and Death is come. <lb/>
            0 woe for Aphrodite ! cry, ye Loves ! <lb/>
            For grief bath robbed her of her beauty fair, <lb/>
            Yea, it bath died with him she greatly loved. <lb/>
            Now call the mountains; woe for Cypris ! woe! <lb/>
            Then from the oak trees comes the answer sad— <lb/>
             <pb n="155"/>
             <lb/>
            Woe for Adonis! woe ! the rivers all <lb/>
            Bewail the grief of Cypris, so bereaved. <lb/>
            The mountain springs lament her lover slain. <lb/>
            In the day's anguish e'en the flowers flush red <lb/>
            And still the piteous dirge goes on, for her <lb/>
            Now straying o'er the mountains, crying shrill­ <lb/>
            “Woe for Adonis! He hath perishéd!” <lb/>
            Then Echo answers-liRe hath perishéd!” <lb/>
            What heart so hard not to lament his loss? <lb/>
            When she first saw his wound, and marked the blood <lb/>
            Pouring .unstaunched from his exhausted limb, <lb/>
            She cast her arms abroad, and weeping, cried­ <lb/>
            " Abide with me, Adonis, yet awhile ! <lb/>
            Awake, and tell me of thy love once more <lb/>
            Ere thou desert me for the gloomy stream <lb/>
            Of Acheron, to which thou fleest fast, <lb/>
            And I, a goddess, cannot follow thee. <lb/>
            Kiss me again, Adonis, yet again. <lb/>
            Persephone will rob me of my love <lb/>
            And in undying sorrow I remain, <lb/>
            Cypris is now a widow-love is dead. <lb/>
            Why wast thou overbold to fight with beasts, <lb/>
            Following the chase without a shield divine ? <lb/>
            So wailed she, and the Loves with her lament, <lb/>
            “ Woe,, woe for Cytherea !—love is dead! " <lb/>
            But thou that weepest, stay not in the woods. <lb/>
            The cold dank leaves are not the bed for him <lb/>
            Whom thou lamentest—lay him on thy couch, <lb/>
            For surely he is beautiful in death, <lb/>
            And seems as if he slept. Adonis dead <lb/>
            May lie in holy slumber for a while <lb/>
            'Neath the soft coverlets, as he was wont. <lb/>
            Bring garlands, and all fragrant blossoms bring. <lb/>
            Sprinkle the Syrian ointments of rich scent <lb/>
            On his unconscious form-he lies enwrapped <lb/>
            In purple raiment-lovely in his death. <lb/>
            Around him weep the Loves, with sighs and groans, <lb/>
            And for Adonis dead they clip their locks. <lb/>
            They crowd upon each other-treading down <lb/>
            His bow and shafts. One tries to lave his wound <lb/>
            With water from a golden vessel, borne <lb/>
             <pb n="156"/>
             <lb/>
            By one of the sad flock, and, piteous sight, <lb/>
            One with his snowy wings Adonis fans! <lb/>
            O woe for Cytherea !—cry, ye Loves! <lb/>
            Then Hymen quenched his torch; he tore to shreds <lb/>
            The bridal crown; he would have no more song. <lb/>
            The Graces and the Muses chant alike <lb/>
            To dead Adonis-but he heeds them not; <lb/>
            For she of Hades will not let him go. <lb/>
            Cease, Cypris, from thy tears—it is enough <lb/>
            Thou must bewail him yet another year.</p>

          <p>It is daybreak at Athens ; and Lysistrata, a young and beautiful woman, is standing alone, with <lb/>
            marks of evident anxiety in her countenance and demeanour. The scene represents the sloping <lb/>
            hill which rises from the Lower to the Upper City. In the background are the Propylaea, the <lb/>
            splendid portals of the Athenian Acropolis. Lysistrata is on the look-out for persons who do <lb/>
            not come, and after exhibiting various symptoms of impatience, she suddenly begins to speak <lb/>
            with abrupt and indignant emphasis.</p>
          <p>LYSISTRATA. Now were they summoned to some shrine of Bacchus, <lb/>
            Pan, Colias, Genetyllis,l there had been <lb/>
            No room to stir, so thick the crowd of timbrels. <lb/>
            And NOW !—there’s not one woman to be seen. <lb/>
            Stay, here comes one, my neighbour Calonice. <lb/>
            Good morning, friend. CALONICE. Good morn, Lysistrata. <lb/>
            Why, what's the matter ? don't look gloomy, child. <lb/>
            It don't become you to knit-knot your eyebrows.</p>
          <p>LYS. My heart is hot within me, Calonice, <lb/>
            And sore I grieve for sake of womankind, <lb/>
            Because the men account us all to be <lb/>
            Sly, shifty rogues, CAL. And so, by Zeus, we are.</p>
          <p>Lys. Yet though I told them to be here betimes, <lb/>
            To talk on weighty business, they don't come, <lb/>

            A Spartan breathing contempt and pride, <lb/>
            Full soon surrendered his arms to me, <lb/>
            And a scanty coat round his loins he tied, <lb/>
            And with unwashed limbs, and with unkempt head, <lb/>
            And with six years' dirt, the intruder fled; <lb/>
            So strict and stern a watch around my mates and I were keeping, <lb/>
            In seventeen rows of serried shields before the fortress sleeping. <lb/>
            And THESE, whom both Euripides and all the Powers on high <lb/>
            Alike detest, shall these, shall these, my manly rage defy ? <lb/>
            Then never be my Trophy shown, on those red plains of <lb/>
            Marathon! <lb/>
            But over this snubby protruding steep <lb/>
            Ere we reach our goal at the Castle keep, <lb/>
            We've still, with our burdensome load, to creep. <lb/>
            And how to manage that blunt incline <lb/>
            Without a donkey, I can't divine. <lb/>
            Dear, how these two great firelogs make my wearied shoulders <lb/>
            toil and aehe. <lb/>
            But still right onward we needs must go, <lb/>
            And still the cinders we needs must blow, <lb/>
            Else we’ll find the fire extinguished, ere we reach our journey's <lb/>
            end. <lb/>
            Puff! Puff! Puff!2 <lb/>
            O the smoke ! the smoke ! <lb/>
            O royal Heracles ! what a lot <lb/>

            On, Laches, on ! to the castle press, <lb/>
            And aid the God in her dire distress; <lb/>

          <p>Thank heaven the fire is still alight, and burning beautifully bright. <lb/>
            So here we'll lay our burdens down, with eager hearts delighted, <lb/>
            And dip the vine-torch in the pot, and get it there ignited. <lb/>
            Then all together at the gates like battering rams we'll butt. <lb/>
            And if our summons they reject, and keep the barriers shut, <lb/>
            We'll burn the very doors with fire, and them with smoke we'll <lb/>
            smother. <lb/>
            So lay the burdens down. Pheugh ! Pheugh ! 0 how this <lb/>

            Lys. We will ourselves be the Treasurers now.</p>
          <p>MAG. You, woman, you be the treasurers ? LYS. Certainly. <lb/>

            Think of our old moderation and gentleness, <lb/>

            still, <lb/>
            All through the days of your former pugnacity, <lb/>
            all through the war that is over and spent: <lb/>
            Not that (be sure) we approved of your policy; <lb/>
            never our griefs you allowed us to vent. <lb/>

            Then would we question you mildly and pleasantly, <lb/>
            inwardly grieving, but outwardly gay; <lb/>
            Husband, how goes it abroad? we would ask of him; <lb/>
            what have ye done in Assembly to-day ? <lb/>
            What would ye write on the side of the Treaty stone? <lb/>
            Husband says angrily, What’s that to you ? <lb/>
            You, hold your tongue ! And I held it accordingly. <lb/>
            STRAT. That is a thing which I NEVER would do!</p>
          <p>MAG. Ma'am, if you hadn't, you'd soon have repented it. <lb/>
            Lys. Therefore I held it, and spake not a word. <lb/>
            Soon of another tremendous absurdity, <lb/>
            wilder and worse than the former we heard. <lb/>
            Husband, I say, with a tender solicitude, <lb/>
            Why have ye passed such a foolish decree ? <lb/>

            outlying states in the east and the west, <lb/>
            Scattered about to a distance surrounding us, <lb/>

            It was only from bad temper that I stripped myself so bare.</p>
          <p>W. On. There, now you look a man : and none will joke and jeer you : <lb/>
            And if you weren't so spiteful that no one can come near you, <lb/>
            I'd have pulled out the insect that is sticking in your eye.</p>
          <p>MEN On. Ay, that is what's consuming me, that little biter-fly. <lb/>
            Yes, scoop it out and show me, when you've got him safe away: <lb/>
            The plaguy little brute, he's been biting me all day.</p>

          <p>MEN On. And he's been dig, dig, digging (so I thank you much for that) <lb/>
            Till the water, now he's gone, keeps running from my eye.</p>
          <p>W. On. But although you've been so naughty, I'll come and wipe it dry, <lb/>

            you. <lb/>
            Now we'll make a faithful treaty, and for evermore agree, <lb/>

            And we were wondrous witty in our cups.</p>
          <p>SECOND ATH. Ay, ay, 'tis when we're sober, we're so daft. <lb/>
            Now if the State would take a friend's advice, <lb/>
            'Twould make its envoys always all get drunk. <lb/>
            When we go dry to Sparta, all our aim <lb/>

            We don't hear aught they say; and we infer <lb/>
            A heap of things they never said at all. <lb/>
            Then we bring home all sorts of differing tales. <lb/>
            Now everything gives pleasure: if a man, <lb/>
            When he should sing Cleitagora, strike up <lb/>
            With Telamon's song, we'd clap him on the back, <lb/>
            And say 'twas excellent; ay, and swear it too. <lb/>

            <title type="sub">OF VARIOUS READINGS</title>
          </ab>
          <p>THE MSS. containing the Lysistrata in a more or less perfect form are <lb/>
            as follows :—</p>
          <p>R. The Ravenna MS.</p>
          <p>(I have the facsimile of R. and am responsible for the presentation of <lb/>
            its readings in this Appendix.)</p>
          <p>H. The Munich MS. (No. 492, State Library).</p>
          <p>P1. The second Parisian (No. 2715, National Library).</p>
          <p>P2. The third Parisian (No. 2717, National Library).</p>
          <p>(These three MSS. were used by Brunck for his edition.)</p>
          <p>I. The Vaticano-Palatine (Pal. No. 67 in the Vatican Library).</p>
          <p>(This MS. was used by Kuster, and apparently by Marco Musuro for <lb/>
            the Editio Princeps.)</p>
          <p>F1. The second Florentine (No. 31. 16 in the Laurentian Library).</p>
          <p>1. The first Leyden (No. 52 in the University Library).</p>
          <p>There is a copy of l., made by Bentley, in the Library of Trinity <lb/>
            College, Cambridge.</p>
          <p>Of these MSS. only R. and H. contain the Play in its entirety. They <lb/>
            belong to the same class, H. being extremely similar to, though not <lb/>
            quite identical with, R.</p>
          <p>The other five MSS. are a quite distinct class, and are obviously all <lb/>
            drawn from one source. They all alike omit the lines between 61 and <lb/>
            132, between 199 and 268, between 819 and 890, and between 1097 and <lb/>
            1237; whilst 1. also omits the lines between 1035 and 1097 and from <note type="footnote"> LYSISTR. </note> <note type="footnote"> p </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="210"/>
            1237 to the end of the Play. I have been in the habit of vituperating <lb/>
            P1. as the originator of countless futile emendations and F1. as the <lb/>
            faithful retailer of the same. But it is apparent from Professor John <lb/>
            Williams Whitens valuable articles on “the MSS. of Aristophanes " that I <lb/>
            did not rightly apportion the amount of criminality between the two. <lb/>
            Fl., being the older MS., must have been the original transgressor and <lb/>
            P1. the indiscriminate copier.</p>
          <p>I must also confess to another mistake which is pointed out by Professor <lb/>
            White with great kindness in the same articles. H. is a MS. in the <lb/>
            Bibliotheca Monacensis which I ignorantly supposed to be a library in the <lb/>
            little principality of Monaco. And as the letter M. had already been <lb/>
            assigned to the Milanese MSS., I gave to this MS. the letter H., the <lb/>
            initial of Herculis Portus which was the ancient name of Monaco. <lb/>
            However the Bibliotheca Monacensis is really the State Library of Munich, <lb/>
            and H. must now stand for the final (the initial being otherwise engaged) <lb/>
            of the Bavarian City.</p>
          <p>Neither the Lysistrata nor the Thesmophoriazusae appeared in the <lb/>
            Editio Princeps, the Aldine edition. Aldus says, "Accipe novem Aristo­ <lb/>
            phanis fabulas, nam decimam, Lysistraten, ideo praetermisimus quia vix <lb/>
            dimidiata haberi a nobis potuit." He might have published a mutilated <lb/>
            Lysistrata, but he seems to know nothing of an eleventh Comedy. It is <lb/>
            probable that he is referring to the MS. which I have called I., and which <lb/>
            on other grounds he is believed to have used. I. does, as we have seen, <lb/>
            contain a mutilated copy of the Lysistrata, but contains no portion of the <lb/>
            Thesmophoriazusae.</p>
          <p>The Aldine edition was published in 1498, and in 1515 Bernardo Giunta <lb/>
            published the same nine Plays at Florence. And in the same year he <lb/>
            published, as a separate volume, the two Plays which Aldus had failed to <lb/>
            procure. In his dedication of the latter volume to Francesco Accolti he <lb/>
            says, "Venit, mi Francisce, expectata dies illa in qua ex Urbinate <lb/>
            Bibliotheca antiquissimum Aristophanis exemplar nacti sumus, ibique <lb/>
            inter alias <foreign xml:lang="grc">Λυσιστράτην καὶ Θεσμοφοριαζούσας</foreign>, non alias visas comoedias <lb/>
            invenimus, basque et tuo nomine cudere tibique dicare, amicorum optime, <lb/>
             <pb n="211"/>
            visum est. Nec te ignorare velim, vir doctissime, plus aliis truneatas <lb/>
            mutilatasque has esse comoedias." And in his final note he says to the <lb/>
            reader, “ Habes, candide lector, nusquam hactenus impressas binas <lb/>
            Aristophanis comoedias, sacrificantes feminas Atticamque Lysistraten, quas <lb/>
            ex codice adeo vetusto excerpsimus ut altera interdum diction is pars ibi <lb/>
            desideretur."</p>
          <p>It is rather surprising to find in Cratander's edition, published at Basle <lb/>
            seventeen years later, not only no recognition of Giunta's publication, but <lb/>
            an implication that these two Plays had never been published before. <lb/>
            Cratander says to the reader, “ Habes, candide lector, praeter novem hac­ <lb/>
            tenus editas Aristophanis comoedias, duas in calce adiunctas, nimirum <lb/>
            sacrificantes foeminas, Atticamque Lysistraten. In quibus si quid <lb/>
            desiderabitur, in exemplar mutilum et corruptum culpam transferas <lb/>
            oportet. Nos, studiis tuis faventes, illas tibi, ut invenimus, minus <lb/>
            expolitas, quam nullas tradere maluimus." His presentation of the two <lb/>
            Comedies is identical with that of 1515, and I do not know whence he <lb/>
            got the name Atticam Lysistraten, if not from Giunta's edition. However <lb/>
            he may of course have consulted the MS. which Giunta consulted..</p>
          <p>That MS. has, of late years, been identified, or sought to be identified, <lb/>
            with the famous MS. of Ravenna. The identification is said to have <lb/>
            been made independently by two critics, W. G. dark, formerly Public <lb/>
            Orator in the University of Cambridge, and Velsen. I have not been <lb/>
            able to obtain Velsen's article, but it is not likely that he added anything <lb/>
            of moment to Clark's argument; for Velsen's excellence as a collator of <lb/>
            MSS. should not blind us to his singular ineffectiveness as a critic. <lb/>
            Clark's argument rests mainly on the fact that he found in the Ravenna <lb/>
            ills. certain pencil marks corresponding with the pages of Giunta's <lb/>
            edition of the two Plays. But this is not a very convincing argument. <lb/>
            The pencil marks might just as well have been made by any later scholar <lb/>
            (Cratander for instance) with Giunta's edition in his hand. And the <lb/>
            description which both Giunta and Cratander give of the MS. in which <lb/>
            they found the Plays is that of a MS. absolutely dissimilar to the <lb/>
            Ravenna. dark admits that their description " is by no means a correct <note type="footnote"> P 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="212"/>
            description of the [Ravenna] MS., for it implies that its leaves have been <lb/>
            worn or the writing defaced by age, which is not the case." And he asks, <lb/>
            “ Is this mere carelessness or deliberate mystification ? " Journal of Philo­ <lb/>
            logy iii. 157. He returns no answer to the question, and it seems to me <lb/>
            that both the suggested solutions are in the highest degree improbable; <lb/>
            and that the only true explanation is that they were not referring to the <lb/>
            Ravenna MS. at all. For why should a writer unnecessarily depreciate <lb/>
            his own wares? Both Plays are in at least as good a condition in the <lb/>
            Ravenna as any of the other nine. The Lysistrata is seventh in the <lb/>
            volume, with six Plays preceding and four following it; the Thesmopho­ <lb/>
            riazusae tenth, followed by the Ecclesiazusae. Yet both Giunta and <lb/>
            Cratander place the Thesmophoriazusae before the Lysistrata, relegating <lb/>
            the latter to the end of the series, a place which it occupied as the last of <lb/>
            the eleven comedies for more than two centuries and a half, until Brunck <lb/>
            in his edition promoted it to be the first of the eleven comedies.</p>

            these trifling differences; being content <lb/>
            in matters of this kind to follow the <lb/>
            reading of the best MSS., and not agree­ <lb/>
            ing with the assumption of some recent <lb/>
            critics that Aristophanes invariably used <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐς</foreign> before a consonant and <foreign xml:lang="grc">εἰς</foreign> before a <lb/>
            vowel; an assumption which, as Enger <lb/>
            observes, "idonea ratione videtur ca­ <lb/>
            rere." I believe that in all such ques­ <lb/>
            tions Aristophanes had regard to the <lb/>
            rhythmical melody of his verse ; a point <lb/>
            of view which never seems even to <lb/>
            present itself to the critics.</p>
          <p>2. <foreign xml:lang="grc">̛̕πὶ Κωλιάδ̕</foreign>’ MSS. and editions. <lb/>
            Bentley proposed ’<foreign xml:lang="grc">ς Κωλιάδος</foreign>, but Ari­ <lb/>
            stophanes appears to have favoured this <lb/>
            interchange of the prepositions. Thus <lb/>
            in Knights 1312 we have <foreign xml:lang="grc">εἰς τὸ Θησεῖον <lb/>
            πλεούσας ἢ</foreign> ’<foreign xml:lang="grc">πὶ τῶν σεμνῶν θεῶν</foreign>, and in <lb/>

            at Ach. 152 expressed a preference for <lb/>
            the form <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐνταυθοὶ</foreign>, which is accordingly <lb/>
            introduced into the text by Dindorf, <lb/>

            <foreign xml:lang="grc">χαλεπή τε</foreign> contra metrum, and so all <lb/>
            editions before Brunck. But Florent <lb/>
            Chretien conjectured TOt, and this was <lb/>
            approved by Scaliger and Bentley, and <lb/>
            being found in P1. P2. and F1. is read by <lb/>
            Brunck and all subsequent editors. <lb/>
            Bentley also, the reading of the last- <lb/>
            mentioned MSS. being then unknown, <lb/>
            suggested <foreign xml:lang="grc">δ</foreign>’ <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἡ</foreign> (and so Bp. Burgess), a <lb/>
            very probable conjecture, and Dawes <lb/>
             <pb n="214"/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">τῶν</foreign>, a very improbable one. For <foreign xml:lang="grc">γυναι­ <lb/>
            κῶν</foreign> Geel suggests, and Van Leeuwen <lb/>
            reads, <foreign xml:lang="grc">γυναιξὶν</foreign>. And for <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἔξοδος</foreign> Dawes, <lb/>
            with great probability, suggested <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἡ <lb/>
            ξοδος</foreign> as in Peace 1181. And this was <lb/>
            approved by Brunck.</p>

            of course was unmetrical, and various <lb/>
            efforts have been made to restore the <lb/>
            metre. F1. inserts ye after <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἦν</foreign>, and though <lb/>
            this makes an anapaest follow a dac­ <lb/>
            tyl it is adopted by P1. and by Brunck <lb/>
            and Invernizzi. Elmsley (at Ach. 323) <lb/>
            and Hermann proposed <foreign xml:lang="grc">τἄρ</foreign>’ for <foreign xml:lang="grc">γὰρ</foreign>, and <lb/>
            are followed by Bothe, Enger, and sub­ <lb/>
            sequent editors except as herein appears. <lb/>
            But <foreign xml:lang="grc">τἄρ</foreign>’ seems out of place here, as <lb/>
            does <foreign xml:lang="grc">τἂν</foreign> which Blaydes substitutes. P2., <lb/>
            besides the regular line, volunteers <lb/>

            rid of the difficulty about <foreign xml:lang="grc">τῶνδε</foreign>, viz. aiX' <lb/>

          <p>42. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐργασαίατο</foreign> MSS. vulgo. This <lb/>
            speech of Calonice is twice quoted by <lb/>
            Clement of Alexandria in his " Paeda­ <lb/>
            gogue " (ii. 10. 109 and iii. 2. 7), and <lb/>
            the carelessness of his quotation, or of <lb/>
            his transcribers, has enabled recent edi­ <lb/>
            tors to pursue with avidity their self­ <lb/>
            appointed task of corrupting the text of <lb/>
            Aristophanes. In the former passage he <lb/>
            quotes this line as <foreign xml:lang="grc">τί γὰρ φρόνιμον γυναῖ­ <lb/>
            κες ἐργασαίατο</foreign> (his MSS. give <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐργάσαιατο</foreign>, <lb/>
            which does not suit the metre) ; and in <lb/>
            the second <foreign xml:lang="grc">τί δ</foreign>’ <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἂν γυναῖκες φρόνιμον <lb/>
            ἐργασαίμεθα</foreign>. Therefore, in defiance of <lb/>
            every Aristophanic MS., <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐργασαίμεθα</foreign> is <lb/>
            promptly introduced into the text by <lb/>
            Meineke, Holden, Blaydes, and Van <lb/>
            Leeuwen.</p>
          <p>43. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐξηνθισμέναι</foreign> MSS. vulgo. And so <lb/>
            Clement in the earlier passage, but in <lb/>
            the latter he has <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐξηνθισμέναι</foreign> ; but two <lb/>
            of his MSS. have <foreign xml:lang="grc">η</foreign> written over the a. <lb/>
            Dindorf in his notes approved of <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐξην­ <lb/>
            θισμέναι</foreign>, which was accordingly adopted <lb/>
            by Enger, Holden, Bergk, Meineke, and <lb/>
            Van Leeuwen. On the absurdity of this <lb/>
            reading see the Commentary.</p>

            Brunch: observed, the accusatives in the <lb/>
            following verse, as well as <foreign xml:lang="grc">κροκωτὰ</foreign> in <lb/>
            this, are governed by <foreign xml:lang="grc">φοροῦσαι</foreign>, and the <lb/>
             <pb n="215"/>
            form <foreign xml:lang="grc">κροκωτοφοροῦαι</foreign> may, as Dindorf <lb/>
            suggests, have been borrowed from 219 <lb/>
            infra. The quotations in Clement were <lb/>
            first noticed by Bentley.</p>
          <p>45. <foreign xml:lang="grc">περιβαρίδας</foreign> MSS. vulgo. Before <lb/>
            Brunck's time the line <foreign xml:lang="grc">χἠ῎γχουσα καὶ τὰ <lb/>
            διαφανῆ χιτώνια</foreign>, which now closes the <lb/>
            next speech of Lysistrata, closed the <lb/>
            present speech of Calonice, following im­ <lb/>
            mediately after the word <foreign xml:lang="grc">περιβαρίδας</foreign>, as <lb/>
            it does in both R. and H. Under that <lb/>
            arrangement the nominative <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἄγχουσα</foreign> <lb/>
            was unintelligible ; and Bentley there­ <lb/>
            fore proposed that line 45 should com­ <lb/>
            mence a new sentence, <foreign xml:lang="grc">τί κιμβερίκ</foreign>’ <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὀρθοστάδια καὶ περιβαρίδες χἠ῎γχουσα κ.τ.λ</foreign>. <lb/>
            Bergler too suggested <foreign xml:lang="grc">περιβαρίδες</foreign>. But <lb/>
            when Brunck, on the authority of I. P1. <lb/>
            P2. supported subsequently by F1. and l., <lb/>
            restored the <foreign xml:lang="grc">χἠ ῎γχουσα</foreign> line to its proper <lb/>
            place in Lysistrata's speech, where it <lb/>
            really does follow the nominative <foreign xml:lang="grc">περι­ <lb/>
            βαρίδες</foreign> (a course which Kuster had <lb/>
            already proposed and in which Brunck <lb/>
            has been followed by every subsequent <lb/>
            editor) the reason for these emendations <lb/>
            disappeared, and it is astonishing to <lb/>
            find Blaydes now for the first time in­ <lb/>
            troducing into the text Bentley's alter­ <lb/>

            quent editors. Bentley (at Callimachi <lb/>
            Fragm. 227) thought that the a in <foreign xml:lang="grc">Θεα­ <lb/>
            γένης</foreign> is short, but it seems more pro­ <lb/>
            bable that <foreign xml:lang="grc">Θεα</foreign>- here as in <foreign xml:lang="grc">θέασαι</foreign> (Peace <lb/>
            906), and as the <foreign xml:lang="grc">νεα</foreign>- in <foreign xml:lang="grc">νεανικὴν</foreign> and <lb/>

            adding that he preferred the omission <lb/>

            denced even by this very Play; but <lb/>
            when we remember that the Athenians <lb/>

            every MS. bears witness that they did <lb/>
            so. Nor is this all. In the course of this <lb/>
            Play the word <foreign xml:lang="grc">οἰῶ</foreign> occurs three times in <lb/>
            an iambic senarius, and in each case it <lb/>
            occupies exactly the same position, and <lb/>
            is followed only by a single cretic, <foreign xml:lang="grc">μάλα</foreign> <lb/>

            alteration introduces the singularly in­ <lb/>
            harmonious jingle of three consecutive <lb/>

            times by the shorter name <foreign xml:lang="grc">πόλις</foreign> (Thuc. <lb/>
            ii. 15). Elsewhere Aristophanes uses the <lb/>
            shorter name ; but in the present Play, <lb/>
            the only Play concerned with the Acro­ <lb/>
            polis, he uses the full name no less <lb/>
            than five times, 176, 179, 241, 263, 482. <lb/>
            Cobet however, in the plenitude of his <lb/>
            wisdom, concludes that as Aristophanes <lb/>
            generally uses the shorter name, he <lb/>
            can NEVER use the full one, even <lb/>
            where, as here, the speech is addressed <lb/>

            stand what the shorter name implied. <lb/>
            Was there ever such a reasoner as <lb/>
            Cobet! He therefore proposes to read <lb/>

            It is, however, adopted by Enger, <lb/>

            (so far as I can see) a shadow of justi­ <lb/>

            the other MSS. intended to give <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐν τε­ <lb/>

            suggested <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὲν Τετραπτόλει</foreign>, and this is <lb/>
            adopted by Brunck and all subsequent <lb/>
            editors except as herein appears. But <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">Τετράπολις</foreign> when used as a substantive <lb/>
            invariably takes the article, and the <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">τῃ̑</foreign> could easily drop out before the first <lb/>
            two letters of <foreign xml:lang="grc">τετραπόλει</foreign>. I had there­ <lb/>
            fore long ago come to the conclusion <lb/>
            that we should read <foreign xml:lang="grc">τῃ̑ τετραπόλει</foreign>, and <lb/>
            the same suggestion has been made by <lb/>

            deed says boldly that R. confirms <lb/>
            Brunck's alteration, which is absolutely <lb/>
            untrue. And as we know (1) that <lb/>
            Dawes's rule is a mere " counsel of per­ <lb/>
            fection," freely ignored by the poets <lb/>
            (see the Commentary on Plutus 166), <lb/>

            to the duplicated <foreign xml:lang="grc">μ</foreign> (see the Appendix <lb/>

            lent to the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐς πόλιν</foreign> of the MSS., which <lb/>
            is a strange mistake, for the Chorus of <lb/>
            Women are not in the Acropolis, and <lb/>
            if the Men were (as they are) carrying <lb/>
            the logs <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐς πόλιν</foreign>, they would not be <lb/>

            wen. <foreign xml:lang="grc">πολιου̑χε, σὰς</foreign> MSS. vulgo. I <lb/>
            accept Bentley's emendation because in <lb/>
            these iambic dipodies which do duty for <lb/>
            a choriamb, we rarely, if ever, find an <lb/>
            anapaest; and because the corresponding <lb/>
            line in the strophe is composed of two <lb/>
            pure choriambs, unless indeed it be the <lb/>
            missing line. It is observable that the <lb/>
            line in the MSS. makes the two <lb/>
            choriambs rhyme, as they do in the two <lb/>
            following verses. Blaydes, though he <lb/>
            adopts Bentley's emendation, yet objects <lb/>
            to it on the ground that it separates <lb/>
            “ parum eleganter " <foreign xml:lang="grc">χρυσολόφα</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">πο­ <lb/>
            λιου̑χε</foreign>. But this is really an argument <lb/>
            in its favour, since the <foreign xml:lang="grc">Πολιου̑χος</foreign> was not <lb/>
            the <foreign xml:lang="grc">χρυσόλοφος</foreign>. See the Commentary.</p>
          <p>347. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἤν ... ὑποπίμπρῃσιν</foreign> MSS. vulgo. <lb/>
            The iota subscript was however absent <lb/>
            until Brunck added it; and Reisig, <lb/>
            taking the verb to be in the indicative, <lb/>
            proposed <foreign xml:lang="grc">εἰ ... ὑποπίμπρησιν</foreign>, which is <lb/>
            adopted by Bothe, Enger, Hall and <lb/>
            Geldart, and Van Leeuwen.</p>
          <p>350. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἔασον ὦ</foreign>.These two words are <lb/>
            given by R. and apparently the other <lb/>
            MSS. to Stratyllis (except that P1. P2. <lb/>
            have <foreign xml:lang="grc">στρατηλατὶς</foreign>) ; and then the Chorus <lb/>
            of Women again take up the speech. <lb/>
            I think that the only editions which <lb/>
            follow R. are Invernizzi and Dindorf's <lb/>
            Oxford edition ; but almost all the older <lb/>
            editions give both lines to Stratyllis, <lb/>
            and all the modern editors continue <lb/>
            them to the Chorus. The reason for <lb/>
            introducing the name of Stratyllis is <lb/>
            that she was the Coryphaeus of the <lb/>
            Women's Chorus, and that while the <lb/>
            songs are sung by the full Chorus, the <lb/>
            dialogue is, as a rule, carried on by the <lb/>
            Coryphaeus alone. But to prefix to the <lb/>
            speeches the name of the Coryphaeus, or <lb/>
            as Van Leeuwen does the title <foreign xml:lang="grc">κορυφαι̑ος</foreign>, <lb/>
            is to place him in the position of an <lb/>
            actor and gives rise to great awkwardness. <lb/>
            It is always the Chorus who are speaking, <lb/>
            though in the dialogue they speak <lb/>
             <pb n="223"/>
            through the mouth of their Coryphaeus. <lb/>
            He is merely their mouthpiece and has <lb/>
            no independent existence. However I <lb/>
            have elsewhere left "Stratyllis" as the <lb/>
            speaker's name.</p>
          <p>352. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἰδει̑ν</foreign>. This word is omitted in <lb/>
            R. H. and in all editions before Kuster, <lb/>
            but is found in I. P1. P2. F1. 1. and is <lb/>
            inserted by Kuster (who had access to <lb/>

            must go. It seems to me that the <lb/>
            omission of <foreign xml:lang="grc">τις</foreign> improves the language <lb/>
            and makes the line far more rhythmical; <lb/>

            to Dawes's rule (see on 311 supra) the <lb/>
            vowel before <foreign xml:lang="grc">βλ</foreign> would be long, and that <lb/>

            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὅπως</foreign> with a subjunctive without of, and <lb/>
            that both these objections might be met <lb/>

            most truly that Dawes's rule was made <lb/>
            too strict, and therefore retained the <lb/>

            both the rules mentioned by Brunck <lb/>

            observed that although the antepenult. <lb/>
            of <foreign xml:lang="grc">δακτυλίδιον</foreign> when derived from <foreign xml:lang="grc">δακτύ­ <lb/>
            λιος</foreign>, a ring, is long, yet when derived <lb/>
            from <foreign xml:lang="grc">δάκτυλας</foreign>, a toe, it is necessarily <lb/>
            short. And he proposed to remodel <lb/>
            this and the preceding line by reading <lb/>
             <pb n="225"/>

            Dindorf (in notes), Weise, Blaydes, and <lb/>
            Van Leeuwen, but involves too great a <lb/>
            departure from the original. Of the <lb/>
            additional syllable supplied by conjec­ <lb/>
            ture, it seems to me that Reisig's is the <lb/>
            most probable.</p>

            is approved by Dindorf in his notes and <lb/>
            adopted by Enger, Meineke, and subse­ <lb/>
            quent editors. But <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀρήξετε</foreign>, charge to the <lb/>
            rescue, gives a very good sense, and the <lb/>
            verb is a favourite one with Aristophanes, <lb/>
            see supra 304, Wasps 402, Thesm. 696, <lb/>
            Plutus 476; and it does not seem jus­ <lb/>
            tifiable to displace it for a verb, which <lb/>
            may give even a better sense, but which <lb/>
            is never employed by Aristophanes in <lb/>

            tolerabilis, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀνεκτέος</foreign> tolerandus.” But tole­ <lb/>
            randus is the very signification required; <lb/>
            and <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀνεκτέος</foreign> answers far more suitably <lb/>

            proposed to add y', and Bergk inserted <lb/>
            ’<foreign xml:lang="grc">σθ</foreign>’. The latter is followed by Holden and <lb/>
            Blaydes. But a little composite lyric <lb/>

            attempts to corrupt a perfectly genuine <lb/>

            in the present line to the 2nd person in <lb/>

            it is obviously an infelicitous conjecture <lb/>

            whitt suggested <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐδεὶς δῆθ</foreign>’, and Reisig <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐ δῆτ</foreign>’, <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐχ</foreign> but the real question is <lb/>
            between the <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐ δῆτ ἔσθ</foreign>’ of Brunck and <lb/>

            The former, which I prefer, was adopted <lb/>

            by Van Leeuwen; but Dindorf in his <lb/>
            notes went over to Dobree, and has been <lb/>
            followed by all subsequent editors except <lb/>
            Blaydes and Van Leeuwen. Dobree <lb/>

            have thought most improbable, but which <lb/>
            is adopted by Blaydes. Dobree himself, <lb/>

            He did not indeed alter the text, but <lb/>
            that has been done by Meineke and one <lb/>
            or two others. Most editors, however, <lb/>
            have wisely forborne to tamper with <lb/>
            the text. It is by no means certain that <lb/>
            the two systems were intended to cor­ <lb/>
            respond closely, and very many altera­ <lb/>
            tions are required to make them do so. <lb/>
            The dimeter systems which wind up the <lb/>
            long tetrameters in the Wasps (621-30 <lb/>
            and 719-24) do not correspond, though <lb/>
            those in the Birds (523-38 and 611-26) <lb/>
            do. And I myself retain the opinion <lb/>
            which I expressed more than forty years <lb/>
            ago, in the Commentary on the Peace, <lb/>
            that in these little corresponding systems <lb/>
            we are not to expect the same exact <lb/>
            metrical concordance which we find in <lb/>
            the lyrical strophes and antistrophes <lb/>
            intended to be sung by the Chorus.</p>

            to, and so all editions except Grynaeus <lb/>
            before Brunck; and Bothe afterwards. <lb/>
            This of course is against the metre, and <lb/>
            Bentley suggested <foreign xml:lang="grc">αἰρώμεθ</foreign>’ <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὦ</foreign>, which Hall <lb/>
            and Geldart read. But all the MSS. and <lb/>
            the Scholiast give the second person. <lb/>
            Grynaeus has <foreign xml:lang="grc">αἴρεσθε δ</foreign>’ <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὦ</foreign>,and Scaliger <lb/>
            proposed <foreign xml:lang="grc">αἴρεσθέ γ</foreign>’<foreign xml:lang="grc">ὦ</foreign>, but both <foreign xml:lang="grc">δὲ</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">γε</foreign> <lb/>
            would be out of place. Brunck substi­ <lb/>
            tuted <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀπαίρετ</foreign>’ <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὦ</foreign>, observing “ Scholiastes, <lb/>
            textus vocem exponens, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀναχωρήσατατε</foreign> ait; <lb/>
            quae interpretatio manifeste refertur ad <lb/>

            It seems to me that the compound verb, <lb/>
            is here more probable than the simple <lb/>
            one. Brunck's emendation has been <lb/>
            followed by all subsequent editors except <lb/>
            Bothe, Holden, and Hall and Geldart. <lb/>
            Meineke in his V. A. proposes <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἄραισθ</foreign>’ <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἂν</foreign>, referring to Frogs 437, where how­ <lb/>
            ever the meaning is quite different, and <lb/>
            this is adopted by Holden.</p>
          <p>541. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἕγωγεΚ</foreign>.T.X. This and the fol­ <lb/>

            and it would be tedious to enumerate all <lb/>
            the suggestions that have been made for <lb/>
            setting them right. It is necessary to <lb/>
            see clearly what their metre should be. <lb/>
            The present line consists of a mono­ <lb/>
            syllabic base followed by two paeons and <lb/>
            two cretics <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BELL_07_fig298.jpg"/></figure><lb/>

              paeons and one cretic — <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BELL_07_fig299.jpg"/></figure><lb/>

              χουμένη</foreign>, and so all editions before Brunck. <lb/>
              This was quite right except that a tro­ <lb/>
              chee was substituted for the first paeon. <lb/>
              Those inveterate conjecturers Pl. Fl., <lb/>
              however, substituted an iambic verse <lb/>
              <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐγὼ</foreign> yap <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὔποτ</foreign>’<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἂν κάμοιμ ὀρχουμένη</foreign> which <lb/>
              is quite out of place, but is adopted by <lb/>
              Brunck, Invernizzi, and Weise. Her­ <lb/>
              mann proposed to restore the first paeon <lb/>
              by reading <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐγώ</foreign> yap <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἕτ</foreign>’av, and Enger by <lb/>
              <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἕγωγεγὰρ</foreign>av, which has been generally <lb/>
              followed. Blaydes, though retaining <lb/>
              Enger's reading in his text, suggested <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὼς <lb/>
              αὐδέποτ</foreign>’ <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἔγωγ</foreign>’ <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀποκάμοιμ</foreign>’ <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἂν ὀρχουμένη</foreign>, a <lb/>
              very good line, but quite unlike the <lb/>
              reading of any MS. or grammarian. It <lb/>
              is, however, brought into the text by <lb/>
              Van Leeuwen.</p>

            Weise; and Bergk and Hall and <lb/>
            Geldart afterwards. Bentley emended <lb/>
            the second half of the line as in the <lb/>
            text <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἕλοι μεκαματηρὸςἄν</foreign>, and Hermann <lb/>
            the first half as in the text <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐδὲ γάνατ <lb/>
            ἂνκάπος</foreign>. The whole line as in the text <lb/>
            is read by Dindorf (in notes), Weise, <lb/>

            The alternative suggestions could not <lb/>
            have been made had their authors <lb/>
            realized the fact that the Chorus of <lb/>
            Women in the orchestra, the women <lb/>
            who are speaking, are the old women, <lb/>
            and the actors on the stage, the women <lb/>
            who are addressed, the young women. <lb/>
            The quotations in Suidas and the other <lb/>
            authors are valueless to determine a <lb/>
            reading, except when they are made for <lb/>
            the sake of a particular word or phrase, <lb/>
            in which case they are good evidence of <lb/>
            the reading in the MS. which those <lb/>
            authors used. Brunck truly observes <lb/>

            of the Scholiast, whose gloss, <foreign xml:lang="grc">λείπει βοηθὸς</foreign>, <lb/>
            shows that he took the line to mean <lb/>
            " He (Aristogeiton) is my Helper" <lb/>
            against the women. It is unnecessary <lb/>
            to consider whether the words can <lb/>
            mean this, since <foreign xml:lang="grc">αὐτὸς</foreign> is metrically <lb/>

            This reading is attributed to Scaliger, <lb/>

            yap (meaning I suppose to omit <foreign xml:lang="grc">μοι</foreign>), but <lb/>
            added " alii <foreign xml:lang="grc">αὔτως</foreign> vel avro." Bergler <lb/>
            in his note says “mallem avro." With <lb/>
            this reading the line is translated by <lb/>

            (in his V. A.) proposed <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀνέσπασα</foreign>, which <lb/>
            is read by Blaydes and Van Leeuwen. <lb/>
            Meineke's reason is that “ <foreign xml:lang="grc">κατέσπασα</foreign> <lb/>
            cum <foreign xml:lang="grc">κάτω πέεσθαι διανοουμένην</foreign> aegre <lb/>
            coit," but it is plain that he dill not <lb/>
            realize the situation. Before the <lb/>
            deserter on her sparrow's back could fly <lb/>
            down to the lower city, she had to fly <lb/>
            up to surmount the wall of the Acro­ <lb/>
            polis ; and it was only while she was <lb/>
            rising for that purpose that she would <lb/>
            be within Lysistrata's reach. She must <lb/>
            have been still within the Acropolis, and <lb/>
            therefore still on her upward flight, <lb/>
            when Lysistrata seized her by the hair <lb/>
            and dragged her down from the sparrow's <lb/>
            back to the ground. So soon as she <lb/>
            began <foreign xml:lang="grc">κάτω πέτεσθαι</foreign> she would have <lb/>
            been out of Lysistrata's reach. <foreign xml:lang="grc">κατέ­ <lb/>
            σπασα</foreign> is the very word required and <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀνέσπασα</foreign> is altogether unsuitable. <lb/>

            the note of the owl), and this is approved <lb/>
            by Dindorf in his notes and read by <lb/>
            Enger. <foreign xml:lang="grc">κικκαβιζουσω̑ν</foreign> Blaydes, Vail <lb/>
            Leeuwen. But the word is found in <lb/>
            Aristotle, Athenaeus, Pollux, Aelian, and <lb/>
            elsewhere, and uniformly begins with <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">κακ-.κικκαβαυ̑</foreign> was a mere fancy word of <lb/>
            Aristophanes.</p>

            This is very plausible, but it seems <lb/>
            impossible to desert the reading of all <lb/>
            the MSS., especially as Aristophanes was <lb/>
            rather given to placing <foreign xml:lang="grc">οἴει</foreign> at the end <lb/>
            of a line. Apart from the present pas­ <lb/>
            sage, he has done so thrice in this very <lb/>

            There seems no ground for Dobree's <lb/>
            proposed transposition <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὰ δὲ νέρτερ' <lb/>
            ὑπέρτερα</foreign>.The two readings are iden­ <lb/>
            tical in meaning, and the MS. reading is <lb/>
            supported by the Scholiast; see the <lb/>
            Commentary. In the corresponding <lb/>
            phrase we invariably find <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἄνω</foreign> placed <lb/>
            before <foreign xml:lang="grc">κάτω</foreign>.Dobree's proposal is how­ <lb/>

            reading in the text, which was not then <lb/>
            known, is better in itself, and accounts <lb/>
            for the double <foreign xml:lang="grc">δὲ</foreign> in R. and H. —</p>
          <p>777-80. <foreign xml:lang="grc">σαφὴς ... προδώσομεν</foreign>. These <lb/>
            four lines were assigned to the " Chorus <lb/>
             <pb n="234"/>
            of Women " by the MSS. and by all <lb/>
            editions before Enger. That this could <lb/>
            not be strictly right is shown by the <lb/>
            words <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀλλ' εἰσίωμεν</foreign>, for the Chorus, who <lb/>
            were in the orchestra, could have had no <lb/>
            idea of entering into the Acropolis. The <lb/>
            lines are obviously spoken by the young <lb/>
            women on the stage, who had been <lb/>
            intending to desert, but are brought <lb/>
            their senses by hearing the oracle; <lb/>
            or rather they are spoken by one on <lb/>
            behalf of the rest. Enger therefore <lb/>
            transferred them to the First Woman, <lb/>
            but I doubt if we are able to specify the <lb/>
            particular woman who speaks them. <lb/>
            But then comes the astonishing Beer <lb/>
            who leaves only half the first line to the <lb/>
            woman, and assigns all the rest of the <lb/>
            speech to Lysistrata, the only person <lb/>
            who could not possibly have spoken it. <lb/>
            The words <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὦ πάντες θεοὶ</foreign> are plainly the <lb/>
            exclamation of persons hearing the <lb/>
            oracle for the first time, and in the three <lb/>
            lines which follow they are expressing <lb/>
            their penitence, and the change of mind <lb/>
            which the oracle has wrought. Yet <lb/>
            Beer's absurdity is followed by Bergk, <lb/>
            Blaydes, and Van Leeuwen.</p>

            adopted by him in his " Metra Aeschyli, <lb/>
            &amp;c. ” published shortly afterwards. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἦν <lb/>
            νεανίσκος</foreign> MSS. vulgo. Hermann was the <lb/>
            first to bring these two systems into <lb/>
            proper metrical order, and his rather <lb/>
            daring alteration here is fully justified <lb/>
            by the necessities of the metre. The <lb/>
            systems are partly in trochaics, but <lb/>
            mostly in paeonies with an admixture <lb/>
            of spondees. The present line consists <lb/>
            of two paeons and a erotic, the corre­ <lb/>
            spending line in the antistrophe being <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἦν τις ἀΐδρυτος ἀβάτοισιν ἐν</foreign>, where the <lb/>
            second syllable of <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀΐδρυτος</foreign>, usually long, <lb/>
            is short. Weise omits <foreign xml:lang="grc">νεανίσκος</foreign> and <lb/>

            should willingly have adopted it had it <lb/>

            this line with 964, but in his notes he <lb/>
            reverts to the common reading. Bergk <lb/>

            Brunck. It is necessary to omit either <lb/>
            the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἂν</foreign> as in the text or the 8'. The <lb/>
            latter course is adopted by P2. 1. and <lb/>
            Scaliger in his notes and by Brunck and, <lb/>
            save as aforesaid, subsequent editors. <lb/>
            The omission of <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἂν</foreign> is more in accord <lb/>
            with the preceding line.</p>
          <p>970. XO. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ΓΥ. μὰ Δί', ἀλλὰ φίλη</foreign>. This <lb/>
            line is given to the Chorus of Women by <lb/>
            R. H. and 1. It is, however, given to <lb/>
            Cinesias by P1. P2. Fl., and this being <lb/>
            followed by Junta has prevailed in <lb/>
            almost all the printed editions. The <lb/>
            only editors who have reclaimed it for <lb/>
            the Women are Invernizzi, Bergk, <lb/>

            Leeuwen ; and of these all but Inver­ <lb/>
            nizzi indemnify Cinesias by giving him <lb/>
            all or part of the following speech, <lb/>
            contrary to the MSS. and, in my opinion, <lb/>
            contrary to all probability. In both <lb/>
            speeches I have followed the arrange­ <lb/>
            ment of the Ravenna MS.</p>
          <p>972. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὠΖεῦ, Ζεῦ</foreign>, Tyrwhitt, Brunch, and <lb/>
            all subsequent editors, except those who <lb/>
            divide the speech between the Chorus <lb/>
            and Cinesias. The MSS. have <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὦ Ζεῦ, <lb/>
            ὦ</foreign> Z<foreign xml:lang="grc">εῦ</foreign>, and so all editions before Brunck.</p>

            some of the earlier editions omit the <lb/>

          <p>982. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ΠΡΟΒΟΥΛΟΣ</foreign>. MSS. vulgo. And <lb/>
            this is undoubtedly right, for that the <lb/>
            speaker is a man of the highest <lb/>
            authority is shown by his statement <lb/>
            that " he will tell the Council to elect <lb/>
            plenipotentiaries." Unfortunately <lb/>
            Bentley suggested not on this line but <lb/>
            on some of the subsequent speeches that <lb/>
            the speaker is Cinesias, a manifest <lb/>
            impossibility, for Cinesias could not have <lb/>
            dictated to the Council the course they <lb/>
            were to pursue ; nor was he in a position <lb/>
            to rally the Herald on his distressful <lb/>
            condition. This has been realized by <lb/>
            every editor except Van Leeuwen, who <lb/>
            throughout the dialogue gives the <lb/>
            speeches of the Probulus to Cinesias.— <lb/>

            corripi debet prior syllaba in <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἔτνος</foreign>," an <lb/>

            a line which requires a paean and <lb/>
            a cretic. For in these four stanzas, as in <lb/>
            Knights 303-11, 382-8, and many other <lb/>
            instances, paeons and cretics are not <lb/>

            must be met by a paeon in the anti­ <lb/>
            strophe, and a cretic by a cretic. In all <lb/>
            the four stanzas the six cretico-paeonic <lb/>
            lines are cast in the same mould ; the <lb/>
            first, second, and fourth containing <lb/>

            a monosyllabic base) two paeons; and <lb/>
            the fifth and sixth two cretics. In the <lb/>

            is adopted by Bothe, Blaydes, and Hall <lb/>

            <foreign xml:lang="grc">χαλεπὴν</foreign> before <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀγανὴν</foreign> because it seems <lb/>
            to me that the missing word should <lb/>
            give the idea of severity in a Judge, as <lb/>
            contrasted with the idea of gentleness <lb/>
            involved in the epithet <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀγανήν</foreign>. And <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">χαλεπὸς</foreign> bears that precise meaning in <lb/>

            Hesychius has <foreign xml:lang="grc">λισσάνιος. ἀγαθὸς, Λάκωνες</foreign>. <lb/>
            And Bentley added that Photius has <lb/>

            as aforesaid, and save that Dindorf has <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">λυσσάνιε</foreign> in his text, though in his notes <lb/>
            he prefers <foreign xml:lang="grc">λισσάνιε</foreign>. Of course if <lb/>
            Hesychius and Photius are referring to <lb/>
            the present line, which is uncertain, <lb/>
            they must have had <foreign xml:lang="grc">λισσάνιε</foreign> in their <lb/>

            favour of <foreign xml:lang="grc">λυσσάνιε</foreign> preponderates. <lb/>
            And it seems to me more probable that <lb/>
            the Laconian, vexed at the grasping <lb/>
            character of the Athenian's demand <lb/>
            which he considers to include " every­ <lb/>
            thing," should have addressed him as <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὦ <lb/>

            the under current which runs through <lb/>

            Bergk, while retaining the reading in <lb/>
            my text, unfortunately suggested <foreign xml:lang="grc">κἠς <lb/>
            .ἅμ</foreign>'(i.e. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἁμὲ</foreign>) <foreign xml:lang="grc">ᾆσμ</foreign>', a suggestion which <lb/>
            nobody has adopted, but which opened <lb/>
            the floodgates of conjecture. Meineke <lb/>
            reads <foreign xml:lang="grc">χἄμ</foreign>' which is as different <lb/>
            as possible from the MS. reading, but is <lb/>
            followed by Holden and Van Leeuwen, <lb/>
            whilst Blaydes reads <foreign xml:lang="grc">χἄμ' αὐτὼς</foreign>, and in <lb/>
            his notes proposes to close the line with <lb/>
            a wholly unauthorized <foreign xml:lang="grc">μέλος</foreign> as he had <lb/>
            already done in lines 1236 and 1243.</p>

            the older editions—Zanetti, Farreus, <lb/>

            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὑμᾶς. ὁρῶν</foreign> is omitted by P1. P2. F1.</p>
          <p>1247. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὅρμαον</foreign> K.T.X. This song is <lb/>
            rightly attributed to <foreign xml:lang="grc">Λάκων</foreign> (who had <lb/>
            promised, four lines above, to sing it) <lb/>
            by R. and apparently all the other MSS., <lb/>
            except P1. (who assigns it to <foreign xml:lang="grc">Λαμπιτὼ</foreign>), <lb/>
            and by all editors before Brunck, and <lb/>
            Enger and Van Leeuwen afterwards. <lb/>
            Brunck changed <foreign xml:lang="grc">Λάκων</foreign> to <foreign xml:lang="grc">Πρέσβυς</foreign>, as <lb/>
            indeed he had done with the preceding <lb/>
            speeches of <foreign xml:lang="grc">Λάκων</foreign>. This was a change for <lb/>
            the worse, for there were Athenian as well <lb/>
            as Laconian <foreign xml:lang="grc">πρέσβεις</foreign> on the stage. It <lb/>
            was however followed by subsequent edi­ <lb/>
            tors before Dindorf who, without a word, <lb/>
            changed it to Xopos <foreign xml:lang="grc">Δακώνων</foreign>. There was, <lb/>
            and could be, no such chorus; see the <lb/>
            Commentary on 1243. Dindorf's error <lb/>
            was, however, followed by all subse­ <lb/>
            quent editors, except as aforesaid.</p>
          <p>1248. <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὼς κυρσανίως</foreign> MSS. vulgo. The <lb/>
            Scholia here are very conflicting, and <lb/>
            while most of them recognize the ac­ <lb/>
            cusative plural, one of them gives the <lb/>
            sentence in Attic Greek as <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὅρμησον, ὦ <lb/>
            Μνημοσύνη, τῷ ἐφήβῳ τὴν σὴν μοῦσαν</foreign>. Ber­ <lb/>
            gler therefore thought that we should <lb/>
            perhaps read <foreign xml:lang="grc">τῷ κυρσανίω</foreign>, meaning " to <lb/>
            the piper," and so Van Leeuwen reads. <lb/>
            Meineke reads <foreign xml:lang="grc">τοῖς κυρσανίοις</foreign>, and is fol­ <lb/>
            lowed by Holden, and by Blaydes in his <lb/>
            text, though in his note he approved of <lb/>
            Bergler's proposal.—<foreign xml:lang="grc">ὦ Μναμνα</foreign> R. H. <lb/>

            conjectured by Florent Chretien, and <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">εἶδεν</foreign> by Meineke. There is some sense <lb/>
            in Florent Chretien's conjecture, but <lb/>
            Meineke should have remembered that <lb/>
            the province of Memory is not to see the <lb/>
            present but to know the past.</p>

            Holden, Blaydes, and Hall and Geldart. <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">σιείκελοι</foreign> Van Leeuwen. In this song, as <lb/>
            everywhere else, Commentators vie with <lb/>
            each other in transforming the lightly - <lb/>
            flavoured language of Aristophanes into <lb/>
            the strictest Doric, and so rendering it <lb/>
            less easily comprehensible by an Athe­ <lb/>
            nian audience. It does not seem de­ <lb/>
            sirable, as a rule, to mention these <lb/>
            ill-judged attempts.</p>
          <p>1259. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀφρὸς ἵετο</foreign> MSS. vulgo. The <lb/>
            repetition of <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀφρὸς</foreign> seems to me very <lb/>
            pleasant and poetical; but it has not <lb/>
            found favour with all editors, and some <lb/>
            have omitted, and others bracketed, the <lb/>
            word in this line. Bergk proposed to <lb/>
            read <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἱδρὼς</foreign> and Meineke <foreign xml:lang="grc">λύθρος</foreign> in its <lb/>
            place.</p>

            But <foreign xml:lang="grc">ψάμμη</foreign> is found in Herodotus, and <lb/>
            may have been the form in use with the <lb/>
            Dorians.</p>

            "<foreign xml:lang="grc">Αρταμι</foreign> and some omit" <foreign xml:lang="grc">Αρτεμι</foreign> altogether. <lb/>
            For <foreign xml:lang="grc">εὔπορος</foreign> (MSS. vulgo) a little below <lb/>
            Blaydes reads <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἔμπεδος. εὔπορος</foreign> seems to <lb/>
            mean abundant.</p>
          <p>1274. <foreign xml:lang="grc">τάσδε τε</foreign> R. H. vulgo ; though <lb/>
            some have <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὰς δέ</foreign> re. <foreign xml:lang="grc">τασδεί</foreign> P1. P2. F1. <lb/>

            Blaydes, and Van Leeuwen.</p>
          <p>1279. <foreign xml:lang="grc">πρόσαγε</foreign>. The Ravenna MS. <lb/>
            gives no sign of a new speaker here, nor <lb/>
            do any of the earlier editions; but the <lb/>
            lines are obviously sung by the regular <lb/>
            chorus of the Play, and the later editors <lb/>
            prefix Xo. or (unnecessarily) Xo. <foreign xml:lang="grc">Αθ</foreign>. And <lb/>
            so it is said do P1. and P2. As regards <lb/>
            the metre, to say, as the Commentators <lb/>
            do, that the first line is iambic, the <lb/>
            second trochaic, and so on, seems to me <lb/>
            to be idle talk. It is really a series of <lb/>
            trisyllabic feet, dactyls and tribrachs, <lb/>
            indiscriminately strung together; as in <lb/>
            the great word of many lines at the <lb/>
            close of the Ecclesiazusae, and should <lb/>
            perhaps be looked upon rather as dance- <lb/>
            music than as a regular poem. I have <lb/>
            inserted <foreign xml:lang="grc">δὴ</foreign> between <foreign xml:lang="grc">πρόσαγε</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">χορόν</foreign>. <lb/>
            It is not found in the MSS. and edi­ <lb/>
            tions.—<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἔπαγε Χάριτας</foreign> MSS. vulgo. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἔπαγε <lb/>

            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀγεσίχορον</foreign> Bergk, Holden. The word <lb/>
            is omitted by Enger, and bracketed by <lb/>
            Blaydes, and seems to be a mere echo <lb/>
            of the <foreign xml:lang="grc">πρόσ</foreign>—<foreign xml:lang="grc">αγε χορὸν</foreign> two lines above. <lb/>
            It encumbers the metre and has no <lb/>
            business here. I have transposed <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἰήιον</foreign> <lb/>
            and <foreign xml:lang="grc">εὔφρον</foreign>', as indeed Van Leeuwen <lb/>
            had done before.</p>

            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὄμμασι</foreign> into <foreign xml:lang="grc">εὐάσι</foreign> and omitting <foreign xml:lang="grc">δαίεται</foreign> ; <lb/>
            and this is done by Enger, and by <lb/>
            Holden in his first edition, but Bergk <lb/>
            did not repeat his proposal in his own <lb/>
            edition, and Holden in his second re­ <lb/>
            turned to the ordinary reading. Meineke <lb/>
            for <foreign xml:lang="grc">Βάκχιος ὄμμασι</foreign> reads <foreign xml:lang="grc">βακχίσιν οἰνάσι</foreign>, <lb/>
            and Blaydes, omitting <foreign xml:lang="grc">Βάκχιος</foreign>, changes <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὄμμασι</foreign> into <foreign xml:lang="grc">λαμπάδι</foreign>.</p>
          <p>1289. <foreign xml:lang="grc">μεγαλόΦρονος</foreign> MSS. vulgo ; an <lb/>
            epithet exactly suited to the arrange­ <lb/>
            ment, which was not merely Peace, but <lb/>
            Peace with Honour. In Birds 1321 the <lb/>
            Birds speak of <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀγανόΦρονος</foreign> ‛<foreign xml:lang="grc">Ησυχίας</foreign>, an <lb/>
            epithet exactly suited to the Bird-song, <lb/>
            but which would be simply unmeaning <lb/>
            here. Yet Reisig, I know not why, <lb/>
            suggested that <foreign xml:lang="grc">μεγαλόΦρονος</foreign> should be <lb/>
            ousted from the present passage, and <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀγανόΦρονος</foreign> enthroned in its place, and <lb/>
            this proposal is approved by Dindorf in <lb/>
            his notes, and adopted by Enger, Holden, <lb/>
            Meineke, and all subsequent editors.</p>
          <p>1295. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ΛΑΚΩΝ. πρόΦαινε κ.τ.λ</foreign>. In the <lb/>
            MSS., and generally in the editions, <lb/>

              as if the whole were part of a speech ; <lb/>
              and as there is no sign prefixed to in­ <lb/>
              dicate a new speaker, the words were <lb/>
              supposed to be a continuation of the <lb/>
              preceding lines, and to be spoken by <lb/>
              the Coryphaeus to the Laconian who <lb/>
              had sung the former solo. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπὶ</foreign> via is ex­ <lb/>
              plained by the Scholiast to mean <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπὶ <lb/>

              his correction is adopted by Brunck <lb/>

              so Bergk, Meineke, and Hall and Gel­ <lb/>
              dart, Bergk bracketing, and Hall and <lb/>
              Geldart omitting the word <foreign xml:lang="grc">Λάκων</foreign>. <lb/>
              Bergk also ascribed the line to Lysis­ <lb/>
              trata, and in this he is followed by all <lb/>
              subsequent editors except Van Leeuwen, <lb/>
              who ascribes the line to the First <lb/>
              Athenian and converts it into a rhym­ <lb/>
              ing couplet, <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BELL_07_fig301.jpg"/></figure> <lb/>
              He could not have made this charming <lb/>
              little rhyme out of Blaydes's text, for <lb/>
              the latter, without the slightest provo­ <lb/>
              cation, changes <foreign xml:lang="grc">δὴ</foreign> into <foreign xml:lang="grc">καὶ</foreign>. Holden <lb/>

          <p>1297. <foreign xml:lang="grc">Ταΰγετον κ.τ.λ</foreign>. The omission <lb/>
            of the prefix to line 1295 necessitated <lb/>
            the invention of some prefix for the <lb/>
            present line; and somebody prefixed <lb/>
            So. <foreign xml:lang="grc">Αακ</foreign>. which is found in all the MSS. <lb/>
            and editions except Van Leeuwen who <lb/>
            has <foreign xml:lang="grc">ΛΑΚΩΝ</foreign>, which would be quite right <lb/>

            <title type="main">PREFACE</title>
          </head>
          <p>WHEN a scholar asks for some indulgence towards his translation of <lb/>
            the Thesmophoriazusae on the ground that it was written from memory, <lb/>
            when he had “ no copy of Aristophanes at hand ", he must obtain from <lb/>
            his fellow scholars a great deal more than indulgence. It is not merely <lb/>
            the effort of memory that is impressive. Most scholars could learn a play <lb/>
            or two if they liked, though I never heard of any one else who knew the <lb/>
            Thesmophoriazusae. It is the whole picture. One likes to think of <lb/>
            the distinguished lawyer who, having a little spare time, turns his mind <lb/>
            to Aristophanes, and, though he has “ no copy at hand ”, thinks out from <lb/>
            memory this happy and loving homage to the ancient artist and play­ <lb/>
            wright and master of laughter. And when we read the preface a little <lb/>
            further, we come on another illuminating fact. When Dr. Rogers got <lb/>
            his copy of Aristophanes and compared it with what lie had written, he <lb/>
            found a number of “inversions and omissions and even contradictions ”.</p>
          <p>And you naturally suppose he corrected them ? Not a bit of it. He <lb/>
            was an artist fully as much as a scholar, and having finished his picture <lb/>
            to his liking there he left it, whether it happened to agree with the <lb/>
            original or not. A fool might do that, with disastrous results; but <lb/>
            when a man who is the reverse of a fool has the courage to do it, one <lb/>
            expects, and rightly expects, something more than commonly good.</p>
          <p>What is one to call this quality of scholarship ? It is old fashioned, <lb/>
            and it is very English. It belongs to an age when scholarship was not <lb/>
            a highly-specialized form of research, but a spirit and a way of life; an <lb/>
            age when a scholar was not methodisch or wissenschaftlich or " up to date ", <lb/>
            did not use card-indexes or tabulate results, but simply steeped himself <lb/>
             <pb n="VI"/>
            in Greek literature till it became a sort of instinct to him, a life-com­ <lb/>
            panion and a permanent joy.</p>
          <p>The old English method had its flaws. It failed in realism. It was <lb/>
            too much dominated by words, and consequently lacked understanding. <lb/>
            There are passages where even Dr. Rogers lapses. Socrates in the Clouds <lb/>
            could never have professed to turn a man into “the flower of talkers, <lb/>
            prattlers, gossips "; smooth-speakers, logic-choppers, and straw-splitters <lb/>
            were more in his line. But after all it was scholarship with a soul. <lb/>
            Its leisurely notes are always written with a live personal interest; it is <lb/>
            never perfunctory; and, among other things, it has produced two famous <lb/>
            translators of Aristophanes.</p>
          <p>Rogers is of the school of Frere, though a far better scholar and artist <lb/>
            than Frere. It is partly the natural difference between 1817 and 1894. <lb/>
            Frere was vigorous, racy, impatient; he was influenced by the political <lb/>
            satire of the Anti-Jacobin, and apt to run wild in repetitions and ver­ <lb/>
            bosities of rhyme, in the style of the Ingoldsby Legends. Rogers bad <lb/>
            much of the same vigour and raciness but he was scholarly and patient <lb/>
            and not verbose. He tried more carefully to understand what Aris­ <lb/>
            tophanes had to say, and consequently translated him much better.</p>
          <p>Of course, ultimately, as all translators find, a perfect translation is an <lb/>
            impossible task, though perhaps not more so than perfection in any other <lb/>
            artistic effort. But in translating Aristophanes the difficulties, as well <lb/>
            as the attractions, are peculiar. For one thing there are the topical <lb/>
            allusions, which can only be enjoyed by those who know the history of <lb/>
            the time. Then there is the indecency. A good deal of euphemism <lb/>
            and reticence is forced on the translator, with the result that, to my <lb/>
            feeling at least, the translations of Aristophanes are apt to be a good <lb/>
            deal more objectionable than Aristophanes himself. He wrote in a con­ <lb/>
            vention in which any part or function of the body might be mentioned <lb/>
            with perfect freedom; whereas the translator, unless he is very skilful, <lb/>
            seems to be always wanting to mention something which is not allowed.</p>
          <p>Then, more important, there is the mistake of thinking that because <lb/>
            Aristophanes often uses language which could now be only used with <lb/>
             <pb n="VII"/>
            decorum by—what shall we say?—by a man in roaring spirits and <lb/>
            slightly tinged by intoxication, therefore he wrote in a rough blusterous <lb/>
            roystering style. The truth is that his style is exquisite; though rapid, <lb/>
            it is delicate and exact, and saturated with love of literature. And, <lb/>
            again, there is the difficulty of comprehending not merely the funda­ <lb/>
            mental seriousness of the Aristophanic criticism of life; that can be <lb/>
            easily grasped; but the amazing mixture in it of frivolity, joyousness, <lb/>
            scurrility, reckless licence, with lyrical beauty and even with yearning <lb/>
            tenderness. The sheer beauty of the Birds is greater even than its wit; <lb/>
            the passionate longing for peace and forgiveness in the Lysistrata almost <lb/>
            makes one forget the farce. And what tenderness there is in the de­ <lb/>
            scription in the Knights of the old writers of comedy who outlive their <lb/>
            vogue and fall on evil days !</p>
          <p>To be large minded, to be brave and generous, and to have a power <lb/>
            of seeing facts ; those three gifts will take a man a long way in life or <lb/>
            in letters, and all three belonged to Aristophanes. His championship <lb/>
            of the subject-Allies against Cleon, and his dauntless crusade for peace <lb/>
            in a war-fevered city, were actions which involved him in great danger <lb/>
            and some serious suffering. They should not be obscured in our minds <lb/>
            by the shock of other more superficial qualities. And, above all, we must <lb/>
            not think we can understand Aristophanes by giving him a modern <lb/>
            label, and calling him a Tory, or a Philistine, or a “pro-German”, or <lb/>
            even a "journalist".</p>
          <p>Of Dr. Rogers's translations it can fairly be said that, if he did not <lb/>
            succeed in the impossible task of reproducing all the varied gifts of his <lb/>
            original, if he sometimes has missed the last modern discovery about the <lb/>
            meaning of the Thesmophoria or the exact positions of Athenian parties, <lb/>
            his translations are the fruits of patient and loving work, of fine scholar­ <lb/>
            ship and intimate appreciation, and, above all, they are translations with <lb/>
            a soul and a spirit. I for one have found myself laughing aloud while <lb/>
            reading them.</p>

              with the pleasant flowers of Spring. It absent, Earth mourns, and' <lb/>
              withholds her life-sustaining gifts. To the quick and lively sympathies <lb/>
              of the Hellene, the legend of this divine sorrow was shrouded with <lb/>
              a solemn and ineffable awe, in consequence of its connection with that <lb/>
              unseen world: and no mysteries were so high and sacred as the two <lb/>
              great solemnities in which it was commemorated. In the Eleusinia were <lb/>
              unfolded the Mysteries of the Four Last Things—Death, Judgement, <lb/>
              the Reward of the Good, and the Punishment of the Wicked-mysteries <lb/>
              which were naturally open to the queen of the unseen world below. In <lb/>
              the Thesmophoria2 the Mother and Daughter were worshipped under <lb/>
              quite a different aspect, as the Civilizers of the visible world above.</p>
          <p>Earth, with her corn and wine and oil, was to the Hellenic mind <lb/>
            emphatically a civilizer of men. Her attractions drew them from the <lb/>
            nomad state of wandering hunters; they became under her influence <lb/>
            settled and agricultural peoples; she taught them the joys of HOME. <lb/>
            To her and her life-sustaining (<foreign xml:lang="grc">Φερέσβιος</foreign>) produce was ascribed the <lb/>
            institution of social laws (<foreign xml:lang="grc">θεσμὰ</foreign>), the rights of property, the laws of <lb/>
            wedlock and the family. They were the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ΘεσμοΦόροι</foreign>3, the Givers and <figure type="illustration">

              invenisse. Nam et sacra eius Thesmophoria, id est legum latio, vocatur. Sed hoc <lb/>
              ideo fingitur, quia, ante inventum frumentum a Cerere, passim homines sine lege <lb/>
              vagabantur ; quae feritas interrupta est invento usu frumentorum, postquam ex <lb/>
              agrorum discretione nata sunt iura." And later in the same note he cites two <lb/>
              lines of Calvus, who says of Demeter— <lb/>
              Et leges sanctas docuit, et cara iugavit <lb/>
              Corpora connubiis, et magnas condidit urbes. <lb/>
              Hyginus (Poet. Astr. ii. 14 Ophiuchus) says " Ceres Triptolemum iussit omnium <lb/>

              Guardians of Home. Let us not tell, says Callimachus (Hymn to <lb/>
              Demeter, 18), of the things which drew tears from Dcmeter: <lb/>
              Rather tell how she to Cities <lb/>
              Gave their social customs sweet, <lb/>
              Taught the hind to reap and garner <lb/>
              Ripened sheaves of wholesome wheat, <lb/>
              And the golden grain to sever, <lb/>
              Sever with the oxen's feet. <lb/>
              And it was in this character that the high festival of the Thesmophoria <lb/>
              was held in their honour, held at the fall of the year, when the Daughter <lb/>
              once more descended into the lower world, to return four months later in <lb/>
              all the freshness of immortal youth to greet the Mother again.</p>
          <p>In the celebration of these solemn mysteries women alone took part. <lb/>
            Men must not' know, or if they knew, must not speak of, the things <lb/>
            which took place in these holy solemnities. Herodotus2 says that he <lb/>
            knows them, but dares not tell. And Miltiades3, leaping over the fence <lb/>
            of the Thesmophorium at Pares, was seized with religious dread, and not <lb/>
            merely feared to venture further, but sprang back with such precipita­ <lb/>
            tion that he sustained the injury which resulted in his death.</p>
          <p>The Athenians celebrated the Thesmophoria 4 on four consecutive days <lb/>
            towards the end of October; from the lOth to the 13th (inclusive) of the <lb/>
            month Pyanepsion. Each of the four days had its special service and its <lb/>
            distinctive appellation : <note type="footnote"> nomad state were forbidden to sow corn, or plant fruit-trees, or drink wine, or <lb/>

          <p>Each of these appellations <foreign xml:lang="grc">ΘεσμοΦορία</foreign> and ’'<foreign xml:lang="grc">Ανοδος</foreign> has been the source <lb/>
            of considerable misapprehension. The Scholiast on Theocritus iv. 25 is <lb/>
            so totally ignorant of the very meaning of the word Thesmophoria, <lb/>
            viz. the institution by Demeter of the unwritten laws of society, that he <lb/>
            supposes it to mean the carrying of written law-books by the Athenian <lb/>
            women ; a mere blunder, but one which has misled many. And the <lb/>

            on the first day of the festival, is, by a converse process, perpetually <lb/>

            world, which was commemorated on the second day of the festival. Of <lb/>
            this latter aberration we have seen two instances in the preceding note, <lb/>
            Hesychius placing the ’'<foreign xml:lang="grc">Ανοδος</foreign> on the 11th of Pyanepsion, which is the <lb/>

              called it <foreign xml:lang="grc">Κάθοδος</foreign>, that is, the Descent of Persephone.</p>
          <p>To the Scholiast on Theocritus, ubi supra, we owe another egregious <lb/>
            mistake, though here too he is not without companions in his error. For <lb/>
            he supposes that the Temple to which the women "went up" on the first <lb/>
            day of the festival was not the Thesmophorium at Athens, but the <lb/>
            Temple of Demeter and Persephone at Eleusis. In other words, he <lb/>
            confounds the Thesmophoria with the Eleusinia. The Athenian Thesmo­ <lb/>
            phoria were celebrated entirely at Athens. The various Hellenic cities <lb/>
            which kept the festival kept it at their own doors. The story told by <lb/>
            Aen. Tact. (Poliorc. 4) about the plot of the Megarians to seize the <lb/>
            Athenian women who were keeping the Thesmophoria at Eleusis, and <lb/>
            the successful counterplot of Peisistratus, refers to the local Eleusinian, <lb/>
            and not to the Athenian, Thesmophoria. We have already alluded to <lb/>
            the Parian Thesmophorium, and many others are mentioned by various <lb/>
            writers. At Thebes the Thesmophoria were celebrated in the citadel <lb/>
            (Xenophon, Hellenics, V. ii. 29). Pausanias (Attica, xxxi. 1) speaks of <lb/>
            a Thesmophorium at the little sea-side village of Halimus (not far <lb/>
            from Peiraeus), where doubtless the Halimusians held their own little <lb/>
            Thesmophoria. And he elsewhere (Phocica, xxxiii, ad fin.) mentions <lb/>
            a Thesmophorium at Drymaea in Phocis, where, he observes, the <lb/>
            Thesmophoria were celebrated every year. He gives no description of <lb/>
            the Athenian Temple, but that it was of considerable size may be <lb/>
            inferred from the fact that it contained <foreign xml:lang="grc">συσσίτια</foreign>, or common mess­ <lb/>
            rooms, where the women lived while the festival was going on. <foreign xml:lang="grc">τρία <lb/>
            'Αθήνησισυσσίτια</foreign>, says Hesychius (s. v. <foreign xml:lang="grc">πρυτανει̑ν</foreign>, and as one of the <lb/>
            three he names the Thesmophorium.</p>

            is also made by Alciphron (Epistle iii. 39), but he keeps clear of the <lb/>
            mistake about Eleusis. The epistle in question is supposed to be written <lb/>
            by a country lad at Athens to his mother at home, and may, with <lb/>
            perhaps sufficient accuracy for our present purpose, be translated as <lb/>

          <p>That on this day the Descent of Persephone into Hades was com­ <lb/>
            memorated is certain; but of the manner in which, and the ritual <lb/>
            wherewith, it was commemorated, no information has come down to us. <lb/>
            " Women," says Praxagora in the Ecelesiazusae (442), " never blab out <lb/>
            their Thesmophorian secrets," a statement which, strange as it may <lb/>
            seem, appears unfortunately to have been strictly true. But we <lb/>
            may conjecture that the day commenced with dance and song, as of <lb/>
            Persephone going forth with her maidens into the soft and fragrant <lb/>
            meadow, to 2 gather the roses, the violets, the hyacinths and the crocuses, <lb/>
            and the wondrous daffodil. And perchance if the great Dance-song of <lb/>
            the present Play be really (as seems probable) imitated from the actual <lb/>
            proceedings in the Thesmophoria, it was sung not on the Day of <lb/>
            Mourning, to which it is here of course adapted, but on the morning <figure type="illustration">

              not the middle day of the festival in the sense of having an equal <lb/>
              number of days before and after it; but the Intermediate Day, the Day <lb/>
              between the <foreign xml:lang="grc">Κάθοδος</foreign>, the Descent into Hades, and the <foreign xml:lang="grc">Καλλιγένεια</foreign>, the <lb/>
              fair new birth of Persephone.</p>
          <p>The earlier scholars had a short and easy way of dealing with the <lb/>
            difficulty " Aristophanes says that the <foreign xml:lang="grc">Νηστεία</foreign> is the third and also <lb/>
            the middle day of the Festival. Therefore the Festival lasted five days." <lb/>
            Such was the view of Meursius, Wesseling, and others, and it is repeated <lb/>
            by Brunch with his usual clearness and confidence. Yet nothing is <lb/>
            more certain than that the festival lasted four days only. And in truth <lb/>
            so far is Aristophanes from implying that it was a five-days' festival, <lb/>
            that he really implies the reverse. For if it really lasted for five days, is <lb/>
            it conceivable that, after stating that this was the Third Day, he should <lb/>
            have thought it necessary to go through an arithmetical calculation, and <lb/>
            announce that the Third was also the Middle Day of the Five ? He <lb/>
            added the description <foreign xml:lang="grc">ή Μέση</foreign>a, because it conveyed an idea not involved in <lb/>
            the statement that it was the Third Day : because it was a name and not <lb/>

          <p>Wellauer, by combining several errors, struck out a more ingenious <lb/>
            solution. We have already noticed the blunder of the Scholiast on <lb/>
            Theocritus about the celebration of the festival at Eleusis. Plutarch, <lb/>
            in the passage to which reference has already been made (Dem. 30), <lb/>
            says that Demosthenes committed suicide at Calauria on the 16th of <lb/>
            Pyanepsion, the day on which the women keep the <foreign xml:lang="grc">Νηστεία</foreign>. If this is <lb/>
            not a mere oversight on the part of the author or his transcribers, <lb/>
            Plutarch is doubtless referring to the date on which the <foreign xml:lang="grc">Νηστεία</foreign>was <lb/>
            kept at Calauria, or possibly in his own Chaeronaea. Wellauer, though <lb/>
            he did not himself confuse the "<foreign xml:lang="grc">Ανοδος</foreign> and the <foreign xml:lang="grc">Κάθοδος</foreign>, yet adopts the <lb/>
            erroneous statement of Hesychius (based on that confusion) that the <lb/>
            "<foreign xml:lang="grc">Ανοδος</foreign> took place on the 11th of Pyanepsion. He next, misled by, and <lb/>
            to some extent mistaking, the Scholiast on Theocritus, supposes that the <lb/>
            women on that day " went up " to the Temple at Eleusis, returning to <lb/>
            celebrate the rest of the Festival at Athens. He then, misled by <lb/>
            Plutarch, imagines that the Athenians celebrated the <foreign xml:lang="grc">Νηστεία</foreign> on the <lb/>
            16th, and consequently the <foreign xml:lang="grc">Κάθοδος</foreign> on the loth, and the <foreign xml:lang="grc">Καλλιγένεια</foreign> <lb/>
            on the 17th. There would thus be an interval of three entire days <lb/>
            between the "<foreign xml:lang="grc">Ανοδος</foreign> and the <foreign xml:lang="grc">Κάθοδος</foreign>. Having by these means persuaded <lb/>
            himself that the festival, though in reality lasting four days, yet was <lb/>
            celebrated in Athens itself for three days only, he proceeds to solve the <lb/>
            problem which Hesychius places before us by adopting the idea, justly <lb/>
            repudiated by Callimachus and the Scholiast on Thesm. 80, that when <lb/>
            Aristophanes calls the <foreign xml:lang="grc">Νηστεία</foreign> the Third Day of the Festival, he is <lb/>
            reckoning the "<foreign xml:lang="grc">Ανοδος</foreign> as the first day: and that when in the same line <lb/>
            he calls it the <foreign xml:lang="grc">Μέση</foreign>, he is omitting the "<foreign xml:lang="grc">Ανοδος</foreign>. But in truth the women <lb/>
            went up to the Temple on the lOth to make preparations for the great <lb/>
            religious drama which was to be enacted there on the 11th, 12th, and <lb/>
            13th. It is absolutely certain that the entire festival was celebrated at <lb/>
            Athens on four consecutive days. The whole difficulty has arisen from <lb/>
            the assumption that <foreign xml:lang="grc">Μέση</foreign> means the middle day of the festival, instead <lb/>
            of the Intermediate Day between the sorrow of the <foreign xml:lang="grc">Κάθοδος</foreign>and the joy <lb/>
            of the <foreign xml:lang="grc">Καλλιγένεια</foreign>. <note type="footnote"> b 2 </note></p><pb n="XX"/>
            
          <p>The other solutions which have been offered have met with no <lb/>
            acceptance, and it would be a mere waste of time to discuss them <lb/>
            here.</p>
          <p>It was on this Day of the Festival, the Intermediate Day, the <lb/>
            Day of Pasting, " when women most have leisure 1," that the women <lb/>
            had arranged to hold a great Assembly in the Thesmophorium, after the <lb/>
            fashion of an Athenian <foreign xml:lang="grc">έκκληία</foreign>, to determine on the punishment to be <lb/>
            inflicted on Euripides for his persistent hostility to the female sex. It is <lb/>
            true that many2 eminent scholars have of late years questioned the <lb/>
            existence of this hostility, and pointed to the characters of Alcestis, <lb/>
            Polyxena, and others, as evidence that Euripides was not incapable of <lb/>
            appreciating, or unwilling to embody in his poetic creations, the highest <lb/>
            and noblest types of womanhood. And doubtless in a great dramatic <lb/>
            poet, looking at life from every point of view, and speaking through the <lb/>
            lips of every variety of character, it is impossible to find an absolute <lb/>
            uniformity of sentiment upon any topic whatever. Nevertheless, it <lb/>
            remains the fact that Euripides, in marked contrast to the other <lb/>
            members of the great Tragic triumvirate, was in the habit of exhibiting <lb/>
            women a prey to the most ungovernable and most ignoble passions; and <lb/>
            that beyond any other writer of any period (and I am not unconscious of <lb/>
            the undercurrent of antipathy towards women which had run through <lb/>
            Hellenic poetry from the very earliest times) he loved to embalm in <lb/>
            a pithy and proverbial form a sentiment of dislike and contempt for the <lb/>
            female character generally. To collect the various passages of this <lb/>
            description which are found in his Plays would be wearisome to the <lb/>
            reader, and distasteful to myself. I will merely mention one circum­ <lb/>
            stance to which attention has not, I think, been hitherto directed. <figure type="illustration">

          <p>Stobaeus was in the habit of collecting, and arranging under various <lb/>
            heads, the most striking and pointed passages of the ancient classical <lb/>
            writers. One of these collections (Anthology, Title 73) bears the <lb/>
            ominous title of <foreign xml:lang="grc">ψόγος γυναικω̑ν</foreign>, Passages in censure of women. Stobaeus <lb/>
            was a man of wide and various reading. His Anthology (not to mention <lb/>
            his other works) contains citations from about 350 authors ; and yet, out <lb/>
            of sixty-four passages collected under this particular heading, no fewer <lb/>
            than thirty-five (if not thirty-six) are contributed by Euripides alone ; <lb/>
            Sophocles supplies two; Aeschylus not one; and most of t he remaining- <lb/>
            twenty-seven (or twenty-six) are taken from professedly satirical or comic <lb/>
            writers.</p>
          <p>Whatever therefore may have been the poet's real attitude towards the <lb/>
            women, they certainly had some excuse for considering him the inveterate <lb/>
            traducer and enemy of their sex.</p>
          <p>At the commencement of the Play, Euripides, In. alarm at this <lb/>
            formidable movement against him, is seen walking with a companion <lb/>
            towards the house of the Tragic Poet Agathon. The companion is one <lb/>
            Mnesilochus, who, throughout the Play, is vaguely described as his <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">κηδεστὴς</foreign>, or connection by marriage. In the Greek Life of Euripides <lb/>
            (written by Manuel Moschopoulos, and first published by Elmsley in his <lb/>
            edition of the Bacchae, A. D. 1821) it is stated that Choerile, the Poet's <lb/>
            second wife, was the daughter of a Mnesilochus; and that her three sons <lb/>
            were named respectively, Mnesilochus (after his maternal grandfather), <lb/>
            Mnesarchides (after his paternal grandfather), and a younger Euripides. <lb/>
            And it has, since that time, been generally assumed that the Mnesilochus <lb/>
            of the Play was the father-in-law of Euripides. But the relation of the <lb/>
            two characters towards each other, and the tone of their conversation, <lb/>
            are scarcely those of a father-in-law and son-in-law; Euripides was at <lb/>
            this time an old man of seventy, and it is hardly probable that his father- <lb/>
            in-law was alive; it seems extremely unlikely that Aristophanes, with <lb/>
            such convenient words as <foreign xml:lang="grc">πενθερὸς</foreign>and <foreign xml:lang="grc">γαμβρὸς</foreign> ready to his hand, should <lb/>
            so persistently have employed the indefinite word <foreign xml:lang="grc">κηδεστὴς, κηδεστής τις</foreign>, <lb/>
            had he really intended to identify his character with the father-in-law of <lb/>
             <pb n="XXII"/>
            Euripides; the name was doubtless a common one amongst the relatives <lb/>
            of Choerile: and in my opinion Aristophanes was either referring to <lb/>
            a brother or cousin of Choerile; or (more probably) merely borrowing <lb/>
            a name from her family, without meaning to identify the character with <lb/>
            any particular individual.</p>
          <p>The object of their visit to Agathon was to induce that Poet, whose <lb/>
            soft and effeminate appearance and manners might well be mistaken for <lb/>
            a woman's, to attend the Thesmophorian assembly in woman's dress, <lb/>
            and endeavour to create a diversion in favour of Euripides. This <lb/>
            Agathon politely, but firmly, declines to do, parrying the request of the <lb/>
            elder bard by the help of various worldly-wise maxims drawn from the <lb/>
            latter's own writings ; and Euripides, as usual in these Comedies, <foreign xml:lang="grc">τοι̑ς <lb/>
            αύτου̑ πτεροι̑ς άλίσκεται</foreign>.</p>
          <p>The tone in which Agathon is satirized in these scenes makes us <lb/>
            appreciate with more pleasure the kindly tribute which Aristophanes <lb/>
            pays him in the Frogs; whilst the manner in which Plato brings <lb/>
            Socrates, Aristophanes, and Agathon together in his Symposium seems <lb/>
            to show that the shafts of comic satire were not necessarily inconsistent <lb/>
            with personal goodwill. It is true that the Symposium is supposed to <lb/>
            have taken place before the date of the Thesmophoriazusae, though after <lb/>
            the date of the Clouds; but Plato is doubtless intending to record the <lb/>
            habitual relations which existed, or might reasonably be represented as <lb/>
            existing, between these famous Athenians.</p>
          <p>On Agathon's refusal, Mnesilochus offers himself as a substitute, and <lb/>
            Agathon is generous enough to place his own wardrobe, well stocked <lb/>
            with articles of feminine attire, at the disposal of the two friends. <lb/>
            And after a long and farcical scene (supposed to be borrowed in part <lb/>
            from a Play of Cratinus), in which Mnesilochus is shaved and singed <lb/>
            and dressed in womanly habiliments, he is at length despatched on his <lb/>
            perilous mission. His interposition in the women's debate does indeed <lb/>
            give rise to so much uproar and hubbub, that the Assembly would in all <lb/>
            probability have broken up in confusion, but for the sudden appearance <lb/>
            of Cleisthenes, a man for more than twenty years the constant butt of <lb/>
             <pb n="XXIII"/>
            the comic stage for his profligate and degrading effeminacy. Cleisthenes <lb/>
            comes, in his character of the women's advocate, to warn them that <lb/>
            there is a traitor in their midst; that Euripides has sent an old rogue, <lb/>
            a connection of his own, <foreign xml:lang="grc">κηδεστήν τινα</foreign>, to spy upon and defeat their <lb/>
            hostile machinations; that a MAN is at this moment profaning 1 by his <lb/>
            presence the sacred mysteries of the Thesmophoria. An immediate <lb/>
            investigation results in the detection of Mnesilochus, who is arrested, <lb/>
            and guarded by the women until the arrival of one of the Scythian <lb/>
            archers who formed the City Police at Athens, By the Scythian he is <lb/>
            tied to a plank, and ignominiously exposed in his women's clothes to the <lb/>
            mockery of the passers by.</p>
          <p>Both while the women are guarding him, and afterwards while he is <lb/>
            in the custody of the Scythian, various schemes, based on certain <lb/>
            incidents in the tragedies of Euripides (the <foreign xml:lang="grc">πανου̑ργος</foreign>, the inventor of <lb/>
            ingenious tricks and devices), are set on foot for the purpose of delivering <lb/>
            him out of the hands of his captors. These, as too subtle, fail to effect <lb/>
            their aim. But at last Euripides wiles away the Scythian by a gross <lb/>
            and sensual, and therefore a wholly un-Euripidean, allurement. And <lb/>
            the final scene of the Play shows us Euripides and Mnesilochus fleeing <lb/>
            for their lives in one direction ; whilst the Scythian, misdirected by the <lb/>
            Chorus, who have now come to terms with Euripides, is racing full pelt, <lb/>
            to overtake the fugitives, in the precisely opposite direction.</p>
          <p>In the rescue-scenes Aristophanes draws specially on three Tragedies <lb/>
            of Euripides—the Palamede, the Helen, and the Andromeda. He has <lb/>
            a scornful word for the Palamede 2; but his witty parodies of the Helen <lb/>
            and the Andromeda are not intended as a satire on the Plays them­ <lb/>
            selves. The spectacle of Euripides endeavouring to effect the release <lb/>
            of Mnesilochus, as the Perseus and Menelaus of his own Plays, was <note type="footnote"> 1 Like Clodius, afterwards, at the mysteries of the Bona Dea. The presence of <lb/>
            Cleisthenes seems to have been considered as no profanation at all. He partook <lb/>
            too much of the womanly character. </note> <figure type="illustration">

            <title type="sub">1. THE PALAMEDE.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>To this Play there is but a brief allusion, and that confined to a single <lb/>
            incident. Palamede had been put to death in Troy-land by the treachery <lb/>
            and violence of his rivals. And Euripides, in the Tragedy, seems to <lb/>
            have made Oeax, Palamede's brother, carve the sad story on oar-blades, <lb/>
            which he then launches on the sea, in the hope (which was fulfilled) that <lb/>
            they or one of them might float across the Aegean, and convey the <lb/>
            intelligence to their father Nauplius in his island-realm of Euboea. <lb/>
            Mnesilochus, desiring to send word of his own sad plight to Euripides, <lb/>
            resolves to follow this precedent, but is at once pulled up by the circum­ <lb/>
            stance (which he had overlooked) that he has not got any oar-blades. <lb/>
            However, he substitutes the votive tablets suspended in the Temple, <lb/>
            carves his story on these, and flings them about in all directions, in the <lb/>
            hope that some of them will come to the hands of Euripides, as they <lb/>
            apparently do. The action of Oeax can hardly have been represented on <lb/>
            the stage; it was doubtless merely described in some narrative or song; <lb/>
            and it seems improbable that the language of Mnesilochus, as he is <lb/>
            carving his story on the tablet, is to any extent borrowed from the <lb/>
            Tragedy of Euripides.</p>

            strange perversion of the old Homeric legend (so familiar to us from the <lb/>
            Palinode1 of Stesichorus) which sent a merely phantom Helen to Ilium, <lb/>
            whilst the real Helen, a pure and stainless wife, was wafted by Hermes <lb/>
            into Egypt, and entrusted to the charge of the good King Proteus. <lb/>
            But after the death of Proteus, his son and successor Theoclymenus <lb/>
            sought, against her will, to make her his wife; and at the commence­ <lb/>
            ment of the Play of Euripides she is discovered sitting on the tomb of <lb/>
            Proteus, as her best refuge from the persecutions of his son. From that <lb/>
            coign of vantage she commences the Prologue, explaining in the form of <lb/>
            a soliloquy, after the usual Euripidean fashion, all the circumstances of <lb/>

            by the entrance of Teucer. And all the passages placed in the mouth of <lb/>

              a question transferred by. Aristophanes to Euripides on his first entry <lb/>
              (Thesm. 871) in the character of Menelaus.</p>
          <p>Teucer's visit appears to be introduced for no other purpose than that <lb/>
            of impressing Helen with a false belief in her husband's death. And so <lb/>
            undoubting is her belief that she immediately begins to discuss with the <lb/>
            Chorus which is the best method of putting an end to her miserable <lb/>
            existence, whether she shall hang herself, or stab herself to death. The <lb/>
            Chorus however make the somewhat obvious suggestion that before <lb/>
            proceeding to so extreme a course as that, it would be wiser to inquire <lb/>
            of Theonoe, who knows everything that is passing in the world, whether <lb/>
            Menelaus Is really alive or dead. And Helen accordingly goes with <lb/>
            them into the palace to consult the Royal seer.</p>
          <p>During their absence who should enter but Menelaus himself? Like <lb/>

            a true Euripidean hero, he is clad in rags and tatters; and finding the <lb/>
            stage vacant, he improves the occasion by soliloquizing on his own woes, <lb/>
            exactly as Helen had done on hers at the beginning of the Play. He <lb/>
            and Helen (really of course the Phantom, but he does not know that) <lb/>
            have been tempest-driven from coast to coast, and finally shipwrecked on <lb/>
            this unknown shore. His ship had been dashed to pieces, a catastrophe <lb/>
            necessary for putting him in a helpless condition from which it would <lb/>
            require all the ingenuity of Euripides to extricate him. And he has left <lb/>
            Helen with his surviving comrades in the deep recesses of a sea-side <lb/>
            cave, whilst he has come up alone to seek for assistance.</p>
          <p>Having thus made the situation perfectly clear to the audience, for <lb/>
            assuredly neither Menelaus here, nor Helen in the prologue, has been <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὰσαφὴς ὲν τῃ̑ φράσει τω̑ι' πραγμάτων</foreign>, he proceeds to knock at the Palace­ <lb/>
            door. The old woman who keeps it refuses him admittance, and after <lb/>
            some valorous threats the hero is reduced to tears. However, he con­ <lb/>
            trives to ask her where he is, and to whom the Palace belongs; and the <lb/>
            following dialogue ensues: <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BELL_07_fig322.jpg"/></figure> <lb/>
              Portions of these lines reappear in the Thesmophoriazusae, broken up by <lb/>

            he receives some surprising information. " In this Palace," says the <lb/>
            portress, "dwells Helen, the daughter of Zeus, the child of Tyndareus, <lb/>
            erewhile the Queen of Sparta," With that she re-enters the Palace, and <lb/>
            shuts to the door. Menelaus is naturally taken aback by this piece of <lb/>
            information, well knowing (as he thinks) that Helen is safe in the <lb/>
            sea-side cave; but the argumentative subtlety with which Euripides <lb/>
            endows his ragged heroes is fully equal to the occasion. True it is that <lb/>
            he has heard of only one Zeus, one Helen, one Tyndareus, one Sparta; <lb/>
            but what of that ? There may be a mail named Zeus living on the banks <lb/>
            of the Nile: there may be another Helen, another Tyndareus, another <lb/>
            Sparta in Egypt.</p><figure type="illustration">
            <graphic url="ENG_BELL_07_fig324.jpg"/></figure>
          <p>When he has arrived at this satisfactory conclusion, out come Helen and <lb/>
            her companions from the Palace in great glee, having beard from the <lb/>
            prophetess that Menelaus is still in the land of the living. But Helen's <lb/>
            rapture is cut short by the sight of the ruffianly desperado at the door, <lb/>
            and though she runs like a young racing mare, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὡς δρομαία πω̑λος</foreign>, to <lb/>
            regain the protecting tomb, he seizes her just as she reaches it. How­ <lb/>
            ever, she soon recognizes her husband, whilst he on his part is amazed at <lb/>
            the extraordinary likeness which this stranger lady bears to Helen. <lb/>
            Aristophanes draws largely on this scene, but it must be remembered <lb/>
            that whilst in the Thesmophoriazusae there is full mutual recognition <lb/>
            between the husband and wife; in the "Helen" Menelaus merely <lb/>
            recognizes the resemblance, and does not for a moment believe that <lb/>
            Helen herself is really before him. <figure type="illustration">

          <p>These lines are found in the Thesmophoriazusae (905-912) with only two <lb/>

            ἰφύων</foreign> for the purpose of pointing a joke at the parentage of Euripides. <lb/>
            But in the Tragedy, when Helen says <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὦ χρόνιοςὲλθὡν ση̑ς δάμαρτος ὲς <lb/>
            χέρας</foreign>, instead of taking her into his arms (as he does in the Thesmo­ <lb/>
            phoriazusae) he indignantly repulses her, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ποίας δάμαρτος ; μὴ θίγῃς ὲμω̑ν <lb/>
            πέπλων</foreign>. Nor will he believe that she is really Helen, until a sailor, <lb/>
            arriving from the sea-side cave, informs him that the Phantom has <lb/>
            vanished into air.</p>
          <p>With the rest of the Play the Thesmophoriazusae has nothing to do; <lb/>
            and it will be sufficient here to mention that the husband and wife, <lb/>
            having recognized each other, take counsel together how to deceive the <lb/>
            king and escape from Egypt. The superior ingenuity of Helen soon <lb/>
            devises a plan ; she gains over to her side the omniscient Theonoe, and <lb/>
            when Theoclymenus returns she passes off the ragged ruffian with whom <lb/>
            she is conversing as a seaman from the ship of Menelaus, who has <lb/>
            brought her tidings of her husband's shipwreck and death. Now then, <lb/>
            she says, she is ready and willing to marry Theoclymenus, but he must <lb/>
            first allow her to pay the last honours, in Hellenic fashion, to her late <lb/>
            Hellenic husband. It is the custom of their people, they explain, when <lb/>
            such a one as Menelaus is lost at sea, to send out a vessel with a suit of <lb/>
            armour, and provisions of all sorts, to the distant horizon, and there the <lb/>
            stores are to be cast into the waves. Theoclymenus falls into the trap, <lb/>
            and furnishes the ship, the arms, and the provisions, with which the pair <lb/>
            make their escape. The outwitting of the dull barbarian by the cunning <lb/>
            Greek is fully as humorous in the Tragedy as in the Comedy, and of <lb/>
             <pb n="XXX"/>
            course in the Tragedy there is none of the grossness which discolours the <lb/>
            closing scenes of the Thesmophoriazusae. Theoclymenus now turns his <lb/>
            anger against his sister Theonoe, apparently 1 for no other purpose than <lb/>
            to provide a somewhat lame excuse for the familiar apparition of the <lb/>
            Deus ex machinâ (in this instance Castor and Polydeuces) at the ending <lb/>

            <title type="sub">III. THE ANDROMEDA.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>The Andromeda, which was exhibited at the same festival as the <lb/>
            Helen, was considered by the ancients to be one of the most beautiful 2 <lb/>
            and pathetic of all the Tragedies of Euripides; and there is nothing in <lb/>
            the Aristophanic parody to throw doubt upon the justice of this estimate. <lb/>
            Like the Iphigeneia in Aulis, and the Rhesus, it dispensed with the <lb/>
            ordinary Euripidean prologue; and the fall of the curtain discloses <lb/>
            Andromeda already bound to the rock, awaiting the break of day, and <lb/>
            the coming of the sea-monster to devour her. She is singing a lament <lb/>
            over her mournful fate, and the opening lines are repeated, apparently <lb/>
            without alteration, in Thesm. 1065 seqq.: 0 holy Night, she sings, how <lb/>
            long 3 a course thou pursnest, driving thy car over the star-studded ridges of <lb/>
            holy Aether, through most august Olympus. And as she pauses, her closing <note type="footnote"> 1 c'The scepticism of Ion and the anger of Theoclymenus are minor issues, <lb/>

            that he was suddenly smitten with an intense longing to bring back Euripides <lb/>
            to the stage once more. And Lucian in his Quomodo historia conscribenda sit <lb/>
            (ad init.) tells us with, I suppose, equal veracity, that the people of Abdera being, <lb/>
            on some occasion, stricken with fever, were perpetually singing and reciting <lb/>
            passages from the Tragic poets, and especially passages from the Andromeda of <lb/>
            Euripides, such as the address of Perseus to the God of Love. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 It seems surprising that Andromeda should complain of the slow passage of <lb/>
            the night. "Why surprising?" asks Fritzsche, in his note on line 1066, <lb/>

            words are softly wafted back by the echo of the surrounding hills; <lb/>
            doubtless a dainty, and even a touching, device in the Andromeda, <lb/>
            although, in the Thesmophoriazusae, Aristophanes prolongs and perverts <lb/>
            it into most laughable comedy. And presently the virgins, who were <lb/>
            her fellows in her fathers court, come in, as the Chorus of the Play, <lb/>
            to mingle their sorrows and lamentations with those of their hapless <lb/>
            Princess. The long monody of Mnesilochus, commencing with the <lb/>
            words <foreign xml:lang="grc">φίλαι παρθένοι, φίλαι</foreign>, and extending from line 1015 to line 1055, <lb/>
            is throughout a parody of Andromeda's address to these "dear, dear <lb/>
            Maidens," and of their sympathetic replies; the old Athenian every­ <lb/>
            where embellishing the narrative of his own misfortunes with the <lb/>
            plaintive wailings of the tender damsel, doomed to a miserable death <lb/>
            in her early youth, unwedded and unwooed. So the night wears away, <lb/>
            and with the dawn the monster is to come. Probably its approach is <lb/>
            supposed to be visible to Andromeda, though of course invisible to the <lb/>
            audience. But before it can reach its helpless victim there enters upon <lb/>
            the scene the Hellenic Saint George, Perseus of the wingèd sandals, <foreign xml:lang="grc">άμφὶ <lb/>
            δὲ ποσσὶν ἒχε πτερόεντα πέδιλα</foreign>. At first he does not perceive the maiden, <lb/>
            and merely wonders at what coast he has happened to arrive (Thesm. <lb/>
            1098 seqq.). And even when his eye falls upon the strange spectacle, at <lb/>
            first he takes her for a marble figure, carved in rare beauty from the rock <lb/>
            itself by some cunning sculptor's hand.</p><figure type="illustration">
            <graphic url="ENG_BELL_07_fig327.jpg"/></figure>
          <p>But when he finds that she is really a living damsel bound to the rock, <lb/>
            he is moved with admiration and compassion, and hastens at once to <lb/>
            address her. The dialogue which ensues is adumbrated in Thesm. <lb/>
            1105 seqq. and is there terminated by the attempt of Perseus to unloose <lb/>
            her bonds, an attempt frustrated by the Scythian archer. In the <note type="footnote"> 1 See Musgrave, Eur. Fragm. Porson at Phoen. 466 ; Bp. Monk, at Alcestis, 358. </note> <lb/>

            Tragedy, doubtless, he does not unloose her bonds until he has slain <lb/>
            the monster of the deep.</p>
          <p>With this abortive attempt at rescue the parody of the Andromeda in <lb/>
            the Thesmophoriazusae concludes. But the first five words of line 105 1 <lb/>
            of the Frogs are supposed to be taken from a later scene in the Andro­ <lb/>
            meda, and to be spoken by Cepheus (Andromeda's father), who is <lb/>
            unwilling to disclose his intentions with regard to his daughter's <lb/>
            marriage, and resents the pertinacity with which Perseus endeavours <lb/>
            to elicit them. There is no room in the Tragedy of Euripides for any <lb/>
            antecedent promise on the part of the king to give his daughter in <lb/>
            marriage to her rescuer. It is Andromeda herself who in the Play <lb/>
            gives the promise. 0 Lady, says Perseus, if I deliver you, will you look <lb/>
            favourably upon me ? 0 Stranger, she replies, take me as your hand maid, <lb/>
            or your wife, or your captive, whichever you will.</p>
          <p>And now, what is the date of the Comedy before us ? The Lysistrata, <lb/>
            as we know from the didascalia preserved in the Greek Argument to <lb/>
            that Play, was exhibited in the archonship of Callias (the Callias who <lb/>
            succeeded Cleocritus), that is, at the commencement of the year B.C. 411, <lb/>
            after the appointment of the <foreign xml:lang="grc">πρόβουλοι</foreign>, but before the revolution of the <lb/>
            Four Hundred. And the Thesmophoriazusae is commonly assigned to <lb/>
            the same date. But it seems clear that this is erroneous, and that it was <lb/>
            produced a year later, in the archonship of Theopompus, at the commence­ <lb/>
            ment of the year 3 B.C. 410, after the disappearance of the Four <figure type="illustration">

              Hundred. We have no didascalia, or other direct statement, purporting <lb/>
              to give its exact date; but there are various chronological notes which <lb/>
              seem to point conclusively to the later year.</p>
          <p>1. One circumstance which would of itself almost carry conviction to <lb/>
            my mind, though many would probably disregard it, is the remarkable <lb/>
            difference in tone between the two Plays. In the Lysistrata everything <lb/>
            is sombre and anxious ; there are tears even in its mirth. The Thesmo­ <lb/>
            phoriazusae is everywhere gay, light-hearted, and playful: the poet <lb/>
            wrote it in his most frolicsome mood.</p>
          <p>In this respect the Lysistrata faithfully reflects the feeling prevalent <lb/>
            in Athens at the close of the year B. C. 412. The Sicilian catastrophe <lb/>
            which had taken place in the autumn of the preceding year not merely <lb/>
            annihilated the Athenian fleets; it had also demonstrated, or seemed to <lb/>
            demonstrate, the superiority of the Syracusan seamen to those of Athens. <lb/>
            And all through the year B. c. 412 allies were falling away, hostile <lb/>
            forces gathering in ever increasing numbers, and even the triumphant <lb/>
            Syracusan triremes were speeding over the sea, to be present at the <lb/>
            downfall of Athens. In the petty naval engagements which had occurred <lb/>
            the Athenian ships had met with varying fortunes, and had shown no <lb/>
            sign of maintaining their former maritime superiority. And at the time <lb/>
            when the Lysistrata was composed the prospect was in every way more <lb/>
            gloomy than it had ever been before, and than it ever became again <lb/>
            until the final disaster of Aegospotami. But at the close of the year <lb/>
            B. C. 411 (when, in my opinion, the Thesmophoriazusae was composed) <lb/>
            men's minds were lighter and more buoyant, and hopes were once more <lb/>
            entertained that Athens might yet emerge in safety from the war. The <lb/>
            commencement of this happier period is traced by Thueydides 1 to the <lb/>
            downfall of the revolutionary Council of 400, and the restoration of <note type="footnote"> to us without a Greek Argument, and (with the exception of the Ecclesiazusae) <lb/>
            the only one which has no didascalia. </note> <figure type="illustration">

              the old constitutional Council of 500. And then too the ever-successful <lb/>
              genius of Alcibiades was again enlisted in his country's service; whilst <lb/>
              in the battle of Cynossema (about Sept. 411) her renovated fleet of <lb/>
              seventy-six triremes entirely defeated a more numerous Peloponnesian <lb/>
              fleet (supposed to have consisted of eighty-six triremes), which included <lb/>
              the dreaded Sicilian squadron under the leadership of Hermocrates. <lb/>
              When the news of this unhoped-for good fortune reached Athens, <lb/>
              Thucydides tells us (and they are almost the last words he ever wrote) <lb/>
              the Athenians were greatly invigorated, and concluded that by strenuous <lb/>
              efforts they might yet be able to get the better of their difficulties. <lb/>
              And this victory was followed, a month later, by a still more splendid <lb/>
              one off Abydos, when, after the battle had raged from morn to eve <lb/>
              without any decisive result, Alcibiades with eighteen triremes arrived in <lb/>
              the nick of time to turn the scale so completely in favour of the <lb/>
              Athenians that they captured no less than thirty of the Peloponnesian <lb/>
              triremes, and but for the intervention of Pharnabazus would in all <lb/>
              probability have destroyed the entire fleet 2. To the sanguine and <lb/>
              cheerful spirit which now succeeded their despondency, the bright <lb/>
              and playful tone of the Thesmophoriazusae seems to me exactly to <lb/>
              correspond.</p>
          <p>2. In the Parabasis the Chorus are instituting a comparison between <lb/>
            the relative merits of men and of women. They take the name of <lb/>
            a man and the name of a woman, and, placing them side by side, show <lb/>
            that in each case the woman is the superior of the two. And the first <lb/>
            instance they give is <foreign xml:lang="grc">Ναυσιμάχης μέν γ' ἢττων ὲστὶν χαρμ</foreign>ȋ<foreign xml:lang="grc">νος</foreign>• <foreign xml:lang="grc">δη̑λα δὲ <lb/>

              Syme; and it is important, for our present purpose, to ascertain, as <lb/>
              nearly as we can, when that engagement took place. The story is told <lb/>
              by Thucydides, Book VIII, chaps. 39-43.</p>
          <p>It was about the winter solstice 1, Dec. 21, B. c. 412, that the Spartans <lb/>
            sent out a detachment of twenty-seven triremes to join their main fleet <lb/>
            at Miletus. The main fleet of the Athenians was stationed at Samos, <lb/>
            a little to the north-west of Miletus. The detachment started from <lb/>
            Cape Malea at the south-eastern extremity of Laconia, and proceeded <lb/>
            in a straight course to Melos. There it fell in with ten Athenian ships, <lb/>
            three of which it destroyed, having captured them without their crews. <lb/>
            The other seven took to flight. This incident disarranged all the plans <lb/>
            of the Peloponnesian commanders. They had on board several very <lb/>
            important officials for whose safety they were bound to take all possible <lb/>
            precautions; and they rightly anticipated that the fugitives would make <lb/>
            for Samos, and report to the Athenian fleet the approach of the Pelo­ <lb/>
            ponnesian reinforcements. Consequently, instead of continuing their <lb/>
            journey to the north-east, they turned southward, fetched a wide circuit <lb/>
            by Crete, and arrived, after a prolonged voyage, at Caunus, on the south <lb/>
            coast of Caria, a little beyond the island of Rhodes. Thence they sent <lb/>
            messengers to the Peloponnesian fleet asking it to come down and convoy <lb/>
            them back to Miletus.</p>
          <p>Mean while, what they had anticipated had occurred. Their approach <lb/>
            had been reported by the fugitives from Melos to the Athenian fleet, <lb/>
            and Charminus had been sent down with twenty triremes from Samos <lb/>
            to intercept the detachment. Charminus, having ascertained that it had <lb/>
            taken shelter at Caunus, kept cruising about the islands of Syme, <lb/>
            Chalce, and Rhodes on the one side, and as far as the Lycian coast <lb/>
            on the other, ready to attack it when it again put to sea.</p>
          <p>But now, in answer to the appeal from Caunus, the entire Pelopon­ <lb/>
            nesian fleet, under Astyochus, was moving southward from Miletus. <lb/>
            They stopped at Cos, sacked the town and ravaged the country; and <note type="footnote"> 1 '<foreign xml:lang="grc">Εν τῳ̄ αὐτῳ̑ χειμω̑νι ... περὶ ἡλίου τροπάς</foreign>.—Thuc. viii. 39. See the note on <lb/>
            Ecclesiazusae, 416. </note> <note type="footnote"> c 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="XXXVI"/>
            then passed on to Cnidus. It was night when they reached Cnidus, <lb/>
            and hearing that Charminus was at the neighbouring island of Syme,. <lb/>
            Astyochus, without disembarking at Cnidus, pressed on the same night <lb/>
            to Syme. The night was wet and cloudy, and he arrived at Syme <lb/>
            without Charminus having any suspicion of his proximity. The <lb/>
            Athenians, being on the look-out for ships approaching from Caunus, <lb/>
            would naturally be stationed on the south side of the island, while <lb/>
            Astyochus, arriving from Cnidus, would approach the island from the <lb/>
            north. In the dark and stormy night he found it impossible to keep <lb/>
            his numerous ships in hand, and a few of them drifted round the <lb/>
            eastward coast of the island, and when the day broke became visible <lb/>
            to Charminus. Thinking them to be part of the detachment for <lb/>
            which lie was lying in wait, he at once attacked them, sinking three <lb/>
            ships, and damaging others; when suddenly he found himself in the <lb/>
            midst of the whole Peloponnesian fleet, and was glad to escape with <lb/>
            the loss of six triremes; first, to a friendly island, and then to Hali­ <lb/>
            carnassus.</p>
          <p>What period of time was covered by these operations we cannot now <lb/>
            even conjecture. But since they did not commence until Dec. 21, <lb/>
            B.C. 412 or thereabouts, it seems unlikely that the news of the defeat <lb/>
            of Charminus could have reached Athens before the dramatic contests <lb/>
            at the commencement of B. c. 411 had actually taken place; and quite <lb/>
            certain that it could not have done so before the competing Plays had <lb/>
            been accepted by the Archon, and were in a forward state of preparation <lb/>
            for the stage. Though, even if the story could by any possibility have <lb/>
            arrived in time for Aristophanes to embody it in his Play, it is in­ <lb/>
            conceivable that he should have made a jest of it while the wound was <lb/>
            still fresh. At that moment, as we have already seen, the fortunes of <lb/>
            Athens were at their lowest ebb, and every piece of good or ill tidings <lb/>
            would send a thrill through the entire community. The loss of three <lb/>
            triremes at Melos and six at Syme would have been a sore discourage­ <lb/>
            ment to the Athenians; and the poet would have been as little inclined <lb/>
            to make, as the audience to listen to, a joke on so unwelcome a disaster. <lb/>
             <pb n="XXXVII"/>
            A year later 1, when fortune had again begun to smile upon the Athenian <lb/>
            navy. it was natural to make light of their previous discouragements.</p>
          <p>3. A few lines later in the Parabasis, Aristophanes reflects on the <lb/>
            conduct of last year's Councillors in surrendering to others the rights <lb/>
            and duties of their senatorial office : <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BELL_07_fig331.jpg"/></figure> <lb/>
              Is any one of our last year's Councillors—a man who surrendered his <lb/>
              councillorship to another—superior to (Eubule) the Lady of good counsel? <lb/>
              Paulmier de Grentemesnil, a man of extraordinary erudition and scholarly <lb/>
              acumen for the times in which he lived (1587-1670), saw at once that <lb/>
              this could only refer to the memorable incident described by Thucydides <lb/>
              in the eighth Book of his History (chaps. 69 and 70) when the Four <lb/>
              Hundred oligarchic revolutionaries suddenly entered the Council-house, <lb/>
              and ordered the 500 constitutional Councillors to take their pay and <lb/>
              begone. About a century before, when a Spartan king 2, assisting one <lb/>
              Athenian faction against the other, had in like manner attempted -to <lb/>
              dissolve the Council of 500, he was met with so stout and determined <lb/>
              a resistance on the part of that body that his political schemes were <lb/>
              entirely frustrated, and he himself compelled to flee from Athens. <lb/>
              A similar resistance was naturally anticipated now, and every prepara­ <lb/>
              tion had been made to overcome it. But the preparations were needless. <lb/>
              The Four Hundred had not even to disclose the daggers which they <lb/>
              carried concealed on their persons; nor were the services of the 120 <lb/>
              Hellenic youths, who were accustomed to carry out their behests, on this <lb/>
              occasion required. Not a blow was struck, not a voice was raised, in <lb/>
              defence of the 500, or of their constitutional rights and duties. The <lb/>
              Councillors quietly pocketed their salary (the salary for their entire year <note type="footnote"> 1 Thiersch's objection that Charminus was dead at the commencement of <lb/>
              B. C. 410 would be unimportant, if true; but it rests on a misunderstanding of <lb/>
              Thuc. viii. 73, where the words '<foreign xml:lang="grc">γπέρβολον ἀποκτείνουσι μετὰ χαρμίνου</foreign> mean they <lb/>
              slew Hyperbolus with the aid of Charminus, " and not, as Thiersch supposed, " they <lb/>
              slew both Hyperbolus and Charminus." </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Hdt. v. 72. </note> <lb/>

              of office, and not merely so much of it as had already been earned) and <lb/>
              evacuated the Council-house without a remonstrance. This tame surrender <lb/>
              by the democratic Council of all its powers and privileges was not only <lb/>
              a very striking event, it was also an event of the greatest importance, <lb/>
              removing every obstacle in Athens to the success of the oligarchical <lb/>
              revolution. It took place, as we now know from the Polity of Athens, <lb/>
              chapter 32, about the end of May, B.C. 411, during the archonship of <lb/>
              Callias, a date exactly suiting the note of time in the Thesmophoriazusae <lb/>
              if the Play was exhibited at the commencement of B.C. 410, but of <lb/>
              course quite incompatible with the earlier date.</p>
          <p>Those who contend that the Play was acted in the year B.C. 411 find <lb/>
            an insuperable difficulty in the allusion before us. Paulmier himself <lb/>
            suggests that Thucydides narrates the dissolution of the 500 out of its <lb/>
            chronological order, and that it really occurred in the early part of <lb/>
            B.C. 412, but this is plainly inadmissible. C. O. Müller (Greek Lit. <lb/>
            xxviii. § 9) thinks that the Chorus are referring to the appointment of <lb/>
            the <foreign xml:lang="grc">πρόβουλοι</foreign> in B.C. 412, but this appointment involved no surrender <lb/>
            of the Councillorship. Others frankly admit that they cannot imagine <lb/>
            what the Chorus can mean.</p>
          <p>4. The civic arrangements in the two Plays, the Lysistrata and the <lb/>
            Thesmophoriazusae, exhibit a difference exactly corresponding to the two <lb/>
            dates, the winter of 412, 411; and the winter of 411, 410. At the <lb/>
            former period the <foreign xml:lang="grc">πρόβουλοι</foreign>, who preceded the Four Hundred, were in <lb/>
            office; and in the Lysistrata it is they who intervene to keep order, and <lb/>
            employ for that purpose the Scythian archers. At the later period the <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">πρόβουλοι</foreign> and the Four Hundred had alike passed away, and the consti­ <lb/>
            tutional Council of 500 had been restored to, and was in quiet enjoyment <lb/>
            of, its normal privileges; and accordingly in the Thesmophoriazusae <lb/>
            order is kept and the Scythian archers employed in the normal manner <lb/>
            by the council acting through its prytanes, just as in the Acharnians and <lb/>
            the Knights.</p>
          <p>5. In the data which we have next to consider the reader must care­ <lb/>
            fully bear in mind-what even the most eminent chronologers seem <lb/>
             <pb n="XXXIX"/>
            occasionally to forget-that the Athenians, in employing such numerals <lb/>
            as <foreign xml:lang="grc">τρίτος, τέταρτος</foreign>, and the like, include as well the day, time, or thing <lb/>
            from which the calculation starts, as the day, time, or thing with which <lb/>
            it concludes. Thus, if we start with Monday, Tuesday is <foreign xml:lang="grc">ή ὑστεραία</foreign>, and <lb/>
            Wednesday I <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἡ τρίτη</foreign>, the third, and not (as we should say) the second, day <lb/>
            from Monday. It would be difficult to give a better example than is <lb/>
            found at the commencement of the Euthydemus of Plato. There three <lb/>
            persons were sitting in the following order: Socrates, Cleinias, Euthy­ <lb/>
            demus. We should call Euthydemus the second from Socrates, but Plato <lb/>
            calls him the third. Crito is asking who Euthydemus is; and to make <lb/>
            it clear whom he means, he says to Socrates, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὃν μὲν ἐγὼ λέγω, ἐκ δεξιᾶς <lb/>
            τρίτος ἀπὸ σοῦ καθῆστο· ἐν μέσῳ δ</foreign>’ <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὑμῶν</foreign> TO ’<foreign xml:lang="grc">Αξιόχου μειράκιον</foreign> (Cleinias) <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἦν</foreign>. There was but one between Euthydemus and Socrates, yet Euthy­ <lb/>
            demus was <foreign xml:lang="grc">τρίτος ἀπὸ Σωκράτους</foreign>. It is hardly necessary to add that, as <lb/>
            a rule, the years mentioned by the Scholiasts are those of the Athenian <lb/>
            archons, extending (about) from Midsummer to Midsummer. Putting <lb/>
            these two rules together, we may observe that if one event happened in <lb/>
            May 411, and another in September 410, although we should consider <lb/>
            the second event as happening in the year after the first, an Athenian <lb/>
            would reckon it as happening in the third year from the first. It will <lb/>
            make the matter clearer if I here set down the list of Athenian Archons <lb/>
            during the 91st, 92nd, and 93rd Olympiads : <figure type="illustration">

              Now, in Thesm. 841 Aristophanes mentions Lamachus in a very compli­ <lb/>
              mentary manner. And the Scholiast says, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπαινεῖ τὸν Λάμαχον νῦν· ἤδη <lb/>
              γὰρ ἐτεθνήκει ἐν Σικελίᾳ τετάρτῳ ἔτει πρότερον</foreign>. If then the Thesmo­ <lb/>
              phoriaznsae was exhibited in the archonship of Theopompus (B.C. 410), <lb/>
              he must, for the reasons we have just been considering, have placed the <lb/>
              death of Lamachus in the archonship of Peisander. And this is the true <lb/>
              date. Thucydides indeed, who divides the year into two periods, the <lb/>
              summer and the winter (irrespective of archonships), merely says that he <lb/>
              died in the summer (of B.C. 414) which would include the last quarter of <lb/>
              the archonship of Chabrias, as well as the first quarter of the archonship of <lb/>
              Peisander; but fortunately Diodorus is more precise, and expressly assigns <lb/>
              it to the year of Peisander's archonship (Book xiv, chaps. 7 and 8).</p>
          <p>6. Again, the Scholiast on Thesm. 190 says, <foreign xml:lang="grc">γέρων γὰρ τότε Εὐριπίδης <lb/>
            ἦν· ἕκτῳ</foreign> yovv <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἔτει ὕστερον τελευτᾷ</foreign>. Taking then the archonship of <lb/>
            Theopompus (B. c. 410) as our starting-point, we have to pass over the <lb/>
            four succeeding Archons—Glaucippus, Diodes, Euctemon, and Antigenes, <lb/>
            and the next Archon will be the sixth from Theopompus. Accordingly, <lb/>
            the next Archon, we shall find, is Callias <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὁ μετὰ</foreign> ’<foreign xml:lang="grc">Αντιγένη</foreign>; in whose year <lb/>
            of office, as we know, the death of Euripides occurred.</p>
          <p>Strangely enough Mr. Fynes Clinton in his Fasti Hellenici (anno 411) <lb/>
            relies on these very references to the death of Lamachus and the death <lb/>
            of Euripides, as showing that the Play was acted in the archonship of <lb/>
            Callias; whereas they both plainly show that it was acted in the archon­ <lb/>
             <pb n="XLI"/>
            ship of Theopompus. He sees, indeed, that there is something wrong <lb/>
            about the reference to the death of Euripides, and observes, "If the <lb/>
            Scholiast placed the death of Euripides in the year of Antigenes, the <lb/>
            sixth year would be the exact description. Euripides however died in <lb/>
            the year of Callias B.C. 406, between whom and the present Callias are <lb/>
            five archons; which sufficiently agrees with the date of this comedy at <lb/>
            the Dionysia of B.C. 411." This is a singular way of making the <lb/>
            Scholiast prove the reverse of what he says.</p>
          <p>Here then are six notes of time all unmistakeably pointing to the <lb/>
            archonship of Theopompus as the date of the production of the Thesmo­ <lb/>
            phoriazusae. There is but one argument in favour of the earlier date <lb/>
            B.C. 411, and although that is undoubtedly a strong one, it seems to me <lb/>
            altogether insufficient to turn the balance against the cumulative weight <lb/>
            of all these arguments in favour of B.C. 410.</p>
          <p>In line 1060 of the Play we are told that Echo in the preceding year, <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">πέρυσιν</foreign>, contended on the Attic stage in conjunction with Euripides; <lb/>
            a statement which the Scholiast, no doubt rightly, explains by saying <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπεὶ πέρυσιν ἐδιδάχθη ἡ</foreign> ’<foreign xml:lang="grc">Ανδρομέδα</foreign>. In line 850 Mnesilochus speaks of <lb/>
            the Helen as a "new play of Euripides, <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὴν καινὴν Ἑλένην</foreign>, and the <lb/>
            Scholiast on line 1012 tells us that the Andromeda was exhibited on <lb/>
            the same occasion as the Helen, <foreign xml:lang="grc">συνδεδίδακται τῃ̑ Ἑλένῃ</foreign>.</p>
          <p>Now the Scholiast on Frogs 53 informs us that the Andromeda was <lb/>
            produced in the eighth year before the Frogs. The latter Play was <lb/>
            acted, as we know, in the Archonship of Callias (the Callias who <lb/>
            succeeded Antigenes). And if we look at the list of Archons given <lb/>
            above, bearing in mind the rules already laid down, we shall find that <lb/>
            the eighth Archonship before that of Callias was the archonship of <lb/>
            Cleocritus. This would place the exhibition of the Andromeda at the <lb/>
            commencement of the year B.C. 412; and therefore the Thesmo­ <lb/>
            phoriazusae, as well as the Lysistrata1 would have to be assigned to <note type="footnote"> 1 The statement of the Scholiast on Lysistrata 963 (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ποία ψυχὴ κ.τ.λ</foreign>.), that th <lb/>

            the year B.C. 411, in direct conflict with the statements in the Scholia <lb/>
            about the death of Lamachus and the death of Euripides, and with all <lb/>
            the indications of time to be found in the Comedy itself.</p>
          <p>However, in the matter of dates the Scholiasts are of little authority. <lb/>
            Either by their own mistakes, or by the carelessness of transcribers, they <lb/>
            are so frequently wrong, that their chronological statements cannot stand <lb/>
            against any real historical evidence. To take one instance out of many. <lb/>
            On line 32 of the present Play the Scholiast says that Agathon exhibited <lb/>
            his first Tragedy1 only three years before the date of the Thesmo­ <lb/>
            phoriazusae. Nobody attaches any weight to this statement. It is <lb/>
            known that Agathon gained the prize in the Tragic competition of <lb/>
            B.C. 416, when Euphemus was archon. Some therefore would alter the <lb/>
            word " 3 " in the Scholium to " 6 " or " 5 ”;an alteration which can only <lb/>
            be justified on the assumption that the Scholiast was sure to be always <lb/>
            right. Doubtless he wrote " 3," and was wrong. So in the Scholium on <lb/>
            the Frogs 2, which gives rise to all the mischief, Dobree would alter “ 8 ” <lb/>
            into "7." I have no doubt that the Scholiast wrote “8,” and was wrong.</p>
          <p>On the whole, therefore, there seems ample reason for affirming that <lb/>
            the Thesmophoriazusae was produced at the commencement of the year <lb/>
            B.C. 410, when Theopompus was archon.</p>
          <p>I am not aware of any poetical translation of the Thesmophoriazusae <lb/>
            in the English language3.</p>
          <p>At some subsequent period Aristophanes wrote another comedy under <lb/>
            the same name. It was commonly called <foreign xml:lang="grc">αἱ δεύετεραι</foreign> (or <foreign xml:lang="grc">αἱ ἕτεραι</foreign>) <figure type="illustration">

              and though the name took no root, it tends to show that the action of <lb/>
              the second Play was laid at a later stage of the festival than the action <lb/>
              of the First. And there seems every reason to believe that in the second <lb/>
              Play the <foreign xml:lang="grc">Νηστεία</foreign>, during which the scenes of the present Comedy are <lb/>
              supposed to have taken place, was represented as already past, and the <lb/>
              <foreign xml:lang="grc">Καλλιγένεια</foreign>, the fourth and last day of the Festival, was already <lb/>
              dawning. We know that Calligeneia herself appeared as the Prologist 2 <lb/>
              of the second Play; and that Aristophanes represented her as the nurse3 of <lb/>
              Demeter. Her appearance would indicate that the whole-day Fast was <lb/>
              over, and the prologue by the nurse of Demeter may well have been, to <lb/>
              some extent, a parody on the Euripidean prologue by the nurse of Medea. <lb/>
              The women appear to have been faint and exhausted after their long <lb/>
              fast, and one speaker4 is anxiously inquiring of another whether any fish <lb/>
              or flesh has been provided to sustain the weary worshippers.</p>
          <p>So far we seem to be on tolerably safe ground: but to the further <lb/>
            question whether the action in the Second Play proceeded on the same <lb/>
            lines as the action in the First, or whether the plot was altogether <lb/>
            different, the fragments do not enable us to give any confident answer. <lb/>

              strangely supposes to be a portion of the address of Calligeneia to the <lb/>
              female chorus, is, on the face of it, obviously addressed to a man, and <lb/>
              is just the advice which might be given to one who, disguised as <lb/>
              a woman, was about to mingle in an assembly of women. And a sub­ <lb/>
              sequent fragment' shows that the precept either was not followed, or <lb/>
              had not the anticipated result. The list of articles pertaining to <lb/>
              a woman's toilet, which forms the longest of all the fragments2, could <lb/>
              scarcely be more appropriate to any scene than to one in which a man <lb/>
              was being dressed up as a woman. Two other lines3, also preserved by <lb/>
              Pollux, would seem to refer, not to the putting on, but to the taking off, <lb/>
              of the woman's clothes. The statement by the same author that " in <lb/>
              the Thesmophoriazusae the name <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὄκλασμα</foreign> was given to the ' Persian <lb/>
              dance 4’” might lead us to suppose that Elaphium's dance was repeated <lb/>
              in the second Play: unless indeed (which seems possible) Pollux is <lb/>
              making an erroneous reference to the present Play, and ought to have <lb/>
              said that " in the Thesmophoriazusae the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὄκλασμα</foreign> was given the name of <lb/>
              the ' Persian dance.’”</p>
          <p>There is no ground for supposing that Euripides, or Agathon, or any <lb/>

              like a reference to the language of Agathon's servant that the Muses are <lb/>
              here and are making their odes, In my Master’s abodes. And in another <lb/>
              passage1 both Agathon and his antitheses are mentioned, but in a way <lb/>
              from which no inference can be drawn.</p>
          <p>It is impossible to put the matter higher than to say that the passages <lb/>
            to which the reader's attention has been directed are quite consistent with <lb/>
            the idea that the second Comedy was framed on somewhat similar lines <lb/>
            to the first; we cannot add that they would be inconsistent with an <lb/>
            altogether different plot. Their evidence therefore amounts to little or <lb/>
            nothing. And the other fragments (about twenty in number) afford no <lb/>
            clue to the nature of the drama from which they were taken.</p>
          <p>Other writers have been able to arrive at a more definite conclusion. <lb/>
            From the name which Demetrius of Troezen gave to the Play (as men­ <lb/>
            tioned above), Dindorf and Bergk are both satisfied that the Second <lb/>
            Comedy was in reality. a continuation of the First ; " nunquam enim," <lb/>
            says the former (Aristophanes, ii. 503), “de inscriptione fabulae in hunc <lb/>
            modum mutandâ cogitare potuisset Demetrius, nisi Thesmophoriazusas <lb/>
            editione alter'a non tarn repetitam quam continuatam esse vidisset." Bergk <lb/>
            (Meineke’s Fragm. Corn. Graec. ii. 1074) is still more explicit. " Demetrii <lb/>
            . auctoritas," he says, " etsi non invaluit, tamen indicio est, actionem in <lb/>
            superstite fabulâ inchoatam, in hac alterâ comoedia perfectam consumma­ <lb/>
            tamque esse, ita ut eontinuo quasi vinculo utrumque drama fuerit con­ <lb/>
            junetum.” This seems to me a very improbable conjecture.</p>
          <p>Yet it is not more improbable than the theory propounded by Bernard <lb/>
            Thiersch in the little essay -he Thesmophoriazusis secundis prefixed to his <lb/>
            edition of the present Play. Thiersch infers from the name <foreign xml:lang="grc">Θεσμο­ <lb/>
            φοριάσασαι</foreign> that the Thesmophoria had come to an end; and he thinks <lb/>
            that Calligeneia, in the prologue, came forward to complain of the mean <lb/>
            and niggardly manner in which the Athenian matrons had kept the <lb/>
            festival: And he concludes (the italics are his own) Aristophanem in <lb/>
            Thesmophoriazusis secundis Athenienses castigasse, quod sancta maiorum <lb/>
            pietate exuti deorum festa splendide celebrare et decorare negligerent. <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Καὶ</foreign> Kar' ’<foreign xml:lang="grc">Αγάθων</foreign>’ <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀντίθετον ἐξευρημένον</foreign>.—Fragm. 7. </note></p><pb n="XLVI"/>
            
          <p>One of Fritzsche’s Aristophanic tracts was entitled " De Aristophanis <lb/>
            Thesmophoriazusis secundis Commentatio.” It was first published at <lb/>
            Rostock in 1831, and was republished at the end of his edition of the <lb/>
            present Play. He argues that the action of the later Comedy was laid <lb/>
            on the <foreign xml:lang="grc">Καλλιγένεια</foreign>, the last day of the festival, and in this I entirely <lb/>
            agree with him ; and arrives at a conclusion exactly opposite to that pro­ <lb/>
            pounded by Thiersch; " Illud igitur certum, summam rei et quasi <lb/>
            eardinem totius fabulae in eo verti, ut luxus Atticarum mulierum, quae <lb/>
            the potissimum Calligeniae pretiosam vestem sumsisse videntur ae mirifice <lb/>

            in the original.</p>
          <p>I cannot myself see sufficient in the Fragments either to support or to <lb/>
            overthrow any of these theories.</p>

            the east, as in the west, of Europe is the <lb/>
            prænuntia veris (Ovid, Fasti ii. 853, cf. <lb/>
            Horace, Epistles I. vii. 13), the herald <lb/>
            and harbinger of Spring. Its advent <lb/>
            in Hellas was greeted with the cry <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὥρα <lb/>

            doors of the wealthy, demanding a <lb/>
            largess in the name of the newly ar­ <lb/>
            rived swallow. The pretty little carol, <lb/>
            or song of the swallow, with which <lb/>
            they announced their visit and pre­ <lb/>
            ferred their request, is preserved by <lb/>

            driving round and round and pounding. <lb/>
            Hesychius gives <foreign xml:lang="grc">πλανω̑</foreign> as the meaning <lb/>
            of <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀλοω̑</foreign>, and both <foreign xml:lang="grc">πλανω̑ν</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">τύπτων</foreign>as <lb/>
            the meanings of <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀλοω̑ν</foreign>. The former is <lb/>
            of course the signification which it bears <lb/>
            here. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἕωθεν</foreign> (vulgo <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἔξωθεν</foreign>) <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐν κύκλω̨ <lb/>
            περιάγων</foreign>, says the Scholiast, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὡς οἱ ἐν ται̑ς <lb/>
            ἅλωσι</foreign>. And so Suidas. The disgust of <lb/>
            Mnesilochus is aptly expressed, as well <lb/>
            by the use of this strong metaphor as <lb/>
            by his application of the term <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἅνθρωπος</foreign>, <lb/>
            the fellow, to his illustrious companion. <lb/>
            Euripides was obliged to pay his visit <lb/>
            at this early hour because the women's <lb/>
            assembly itself was to be held at day­ <lb/>
            break, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἕωθεν</foreign>, infra 376, and see Eccl. 20 <lb/>
            and the note there.</p>
          <p>3. <foreign xml:lang="grc">σπλη̑να</foreign>] The ancients attributed to <lb/>
            the action of the spleen (lien) the <lb/>
            internal heavings and palpitations oc­ <lb/>
            casioned by violent exercise or ex­ <lb/>
            citement. Thus in Plautus, Casina, <lb/>
            II. vi. 62, Olympic says <lb/>
            Perii ! cor LIENOSUM, opinor, habeo; iamdudum salit; <lb/>
            De labore pectus tundit.</p>
          <p>And in Mercator, 1. i. 13 (to which I observe Bothe also refers) Acanthio, panting <lb/>
            and out of breath, says <lb/>
            genua hunc cursorem deserunt. <lb/>
            Perii' seditionem facit LIEN; occupat praecordia.</p>
          <p>5. <foreign xml:lang="grc">άλλ' ούκ άκούειν κ. τ. λ</foreign>. ] Euripides <lb/>

              Ka\ opav, L7Tc TOV (IT)Tanoveivprjff opav. <lb/>
              Fritzsche indeed, considering them a <lb/>
              continuation of Euripides's speech, <lb/>
              would render that speech as follows : <lb/>
              "Imo aliud est horum alterutrum, aut <lb/>
              audire aut videre ; aliud neutrum, neque <lb/>
              audire neque videre." "I said that <lb/>
              you were not to hear and see ; which <lb/>
              is something quite different from say­ <lb/>
              ing that you were neither to hear nor <lb/>
              to see." But this, though harmonizing <lb/>
              excellently with the dialogue up to <lb/>
              this point, is quite inconsistent with <lb/>
              the explanation which Euripides now <lb/>
              proceeds to unfold. "What you see," <lb/>
              he says in effect, "you must not hear : <lb/>
              and what you hear you must not see : <lb/>
              the objects of these two senses (sight <lb/>
              and hearing) must be kept distinct, <lb/>
              even as the organs by which they act <lb/>
              are in the nature of things essentially <lb/>
              distinct." The words <foreign xml:lang="grc">εὖἴσθ' ὅτι</foreign> here, <lb/>
              as in Peace 373, constitute an emphatic <lb/>
              answer in the affirmative to the pre­ <lb/>
              ceding question.</p>
          <p>13. <foreign xml:lang="grc">τότε</foreign>] Then, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὅτε διεκρίθη</foreign>], An anony­ <lb/>
            mous critic would read <foreign xml:lang="grc">ποτὲ</foreign>, but of <lb/>

            speaker's mind has travelled, but which <lb/>
            has not been actually mentioned. So in <lb/>
            the fourteenth of Lucian's Sea Dialogues, <lb/>
            where the Nereids are told that Andro­ <lb/>
            meda has been rescued from the set­ <lb/>
            monster which they had sent against <lb/>

            by Aristophanes as the chief Euripidean <lb/>
            deity (see Frogs 892 and the note <lb/>
            there), is throughout this passage re­ <lb/>
            garded as the great active and intelli­ <lb/>
            gent Principle, evolving out of her own <lb/>
            substance the various forms of the <lb/>
            animal creation. When Ether was first <lb/>
            parting and dividing herself, and giving <lb/>
            birth within herself to living and moving <lb/>
            bodies. <foreign xml:lang="grc">διεχωρίζετο</foreign>, which is universally <lb/>
            taken in a passive sense, and translated <lb/>
            secerni coepit, seems to mean divided <lb/>
            herself; for who but Ether, in this <lb/>
            philosophy, could divide Ether ? And <lb/>

            where that ingenious young lady, who <lb/>
            has hidden her illegitimate children in <lb/>
            the cow-house, is endeavouring to per­ <lb/>
            suade her father, by an argument <lb/>
            drawn from the original homogeneous­ <lb/>
            ness of all matter, that it is as natural <lb/>
            for cows to give birth to boys, as to <lb/>
            calves.</p><figure type="illustration">

          <p>It was from the same philosophic <lb/>

            that of the ear with a funnel, are <lb/>
            found in the Republic of Plato. In <lb/>
            vi. 19 (508 B) he calls the human eye<figure type="illustration">

              <foreign xml:lang="grc">γάνων</foreign>. And in iii. 18 (411 A) he ob­ <lb/>
              serves, "He who allows the strains of <lb/>
              plaintive and touching music to sink <lb/>
              down into his soul, through his ears, <lb/>

              able which before was rigid and use­ <lb/>
              less ; but if he lend himself too long to <lb/>
              those soft and tender melodies, they <lb/>
              will at last melt and dissolve his soul, <lb/>
              and he will become, what Homer <lb/>
              calls, but a nerveless warrior." I sus­ <lb/>
              pect that in this opening dialogue there <lb/>
              is a far more extensive parodying of <lb/>
              the words of Euripides than we are now <lb/>
              in a position to detect.</p>
          <p>21. <foreign xml:lang="grc">αἱ σοφαὶ ξυνουσίαι</foreign>] The Scholiast <lb/>
            cites a line, <foreign xml:lang="grc">σοφοὶ τύραννοι τω̑ν σοφω̑ν <lb/>
            ξυνουσία̨</foreign>, about the authorship of which <lb/>
            there was much discussion amongst an­ <lb/>
            cient writers. It seems to have made <lb/>
            its first appearance in the " Locrian <lb/>
            Aias" of Sophocles, and to have been <lb/>
            borrowed from thence by Euripides, to <lb/>
            whom it was consequently ascribed by <lb/>
            Plato, Antisthenes, and Stobaeus, and, <lb/>
            according to the Scholiast here, by <lb/>
            Aristophanes himself in the " Heroes." <lb/>
            Such was apparently the conclusion at <lb/>
            which Aulus Gellius (xiii. 18) arrived ; <lb/>
            and he gives other instances of lines <lb/>
            borrowed by Euripides from preceding <lb/>
            poets. And see the note on Frogs <lb/>
            1182. The authorities on the subject <lb/>
            will be found in Wagner's Fragments <lb/>
            of the " Locrian Aias." With the form <lb/>
            in which it here appears, Person com­ <lb/>
            pares a line of Eupolis preserved by <lb/>
            the Scholiast (and, in part, by Eusta­ <lb/>

            24. <foreign xml:lang="grc">προσμάθοιμι</foreign>] The MSS. have <foreign xml:lang="grc">προσ­ <lb/>
            μάθοι μὴ</foreign>, and it is not altogether easy <lb/>
            to determine whether this should be <lb/>
            altered into <foreign xml:lang="grc">προσμάθοιμι</foreign> or into <foreign xml:lang="grc">προσμάθω <lb/>
            μή</foreign>. Each alteration makes perfectly <lb/>
            good Greek, and is supported by emi­ <lb/>
            nent scholars : and in each there would <lb/>
            of course be the same gird at Euripides <lb/>
            as the great <foreign xml:lang="grc">χωλοποιός</foreign>; Ach. 411, <lb/>
            Peace 147, Frogs 846. But though in <lb/>
            the translation, using Bekker's edition, <lb/>
            I followed Bekker's reading <foreign xml:lang="grc">προσμύθω <lb/>
            μὴ</foreign>, yet I quite concur with most of the <lb/>
            recent editors in thinking that the <lb/>
            genuine reading is <foreign xml:lang="grc">προσμάθοιμι</foreign>, and that <lb/>
            the words <foreign xml:lang="grc">χωλο̇ς εἶναι τὼ σκέλη</foreign> are added <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">παρὰ προσδοκίαν</foreign>, as a mere piece of im­ <lb/>
            pertinence on the part of Mnesilochus. <lb/>
            And the Scholiast's explanation <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἵναμὴ <lb/>

            be simple nonsense, intended to repre­ <lb/>
            sent the effect produced on the old <lb/>
            man's mind by the philosophic subtlety <lb/>
            of his companion's talk. The same sort <lb/>
            of mild imbecility is evident in line 19 <lb/>
            Then it is all along of the funnel that <lb/>
            I am neither to hear nor to see! ; and <lb/>
            indeed in the <foreign xml:lang="grc">οἶμαί γε</foreign> of the present <lb/>
            line, which indicates a want of con­ <lb/>
            fidence in his own eyesight, after Euri­ <lb/>
            pides's abstruse explanation of the <lb/>
            origin and functions of the eye. Com­ <lb/>

            first listening to the luminous wisdom <lb/>
            of Socrates ; Clouds 236. There is <lb/>
            however great ingenuity in the view <lb/>
            advanced by Fritzsche. who supposes <lb/>
            that the remarks of Mnesilochus in this <lb/>
            and the following line are mere reca­ <lb/>
            pitulations whereby he is endeavouring <lb/>
            to impress upon his memory the several <lb/>
            points which, as he supposes, Euripides <lb/>
            requires him to observe, <foreign xml:lang="grc">πρόσεχε τὸν <lb/>
            νου̑ν</foreign>, 25 supra. Euripides first bids him <lb/>
            observe the wicket; then he tells him <lb/>
            to be silent. Mnesilochus runs over in <lb/>
            his mind these two points : (1) I am to <lb/>
            be silent ; (2) the wicket. Then Euri­ <lb/>
            pides adds a third point; he is to listen. <lb/>
            " Italic augetur Mnesilocho omnia re­ <lb/>
            cordandi commemorandique labor : vel <lb/>
            sic tamen bene rationem tenet, neque <lb/>

            I am to listen ; (2) <foreign xml:lang="grc">καὶ σιωπω̑</foreign> and to be <lb/>
            silent; (3) <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸθύριον</foreign>, the wicket. The <lb/>
            Scholiast has a different explanation <figure type="illustration">

              . This <lb/>

              <foreign xml:lang="grc">γων</foreign>] These epithets are selected for the <lb/>
              purpose of ridiculing the delicate and <lb/>
              effeminate appearance of Agathon, who <lb/>
              is described infra 191 as <figure type="illustration">

              Whether there was any other Athenian <lb/>
              of the name, to whom the epithets <lb/>
              would apply, is very doubtful. The <lb/>
              Scholiast says, <foreign xml:lang="grc">οἱ περὶ 'Αρίσταρχον καὶ</foreign> <figure type="illustration">

            very exact, he qualifies the strength of <lb/>
            his original denial by adding '' At least, <lb/>
            if I did ever see him, I did not know <lb/>
            who he was." Of, Clouds 1252, Eccl. <lb/>
            350, Plato, Theaetetus, chap. 2. So in <lb/>
            the Latin dramatists. "Nunquam ante <lb/>
            hunc them meis oculis eam, quod nossem, <lb/>
            videram," Terence, Hecyra V. iv. 23. <lb/>
            " (A) Non me novisti ? (B) quod quidem <lb/>
            nunc veniat in mentem mihi," Plautus, <lb/>
            Epidicus V. i. 32. The vice imputed to <lb/>
            Agathon in the next line is again sug­ <lb/>
            gested infra 50, 200-207 and elsewhere. <lb/>
            Plato (Protagoras, chap. 7) implies that <lb/>
            he was the <foreign xml:lang="grc">παιδικὰ</foreign> of Pausanias ; whilst <lb/>
            Aelian (V. H. ii. 21, xiii. 4) speaks of <lb/>
            Euripides as being also his lover. And <lb/>
            Plato's own epigram on Agathon is not <lb/>
            altogether pleasant reading.</p>
          <p>37. <foreign xml:lang="grc">πυ̑ρ καὶ μυρρίνας</foreign>] The <foreign xml:lang="grc">θύριον</foreign> now <lb/>
            opens, and Agathon's servant comes <lb/>
            out. He brings with him a pan of live <lb/>
            coals, and some myrtle branches, and <lb/>
            is therefore obviously about to offer up <lb/>
            a solemn prayer or sacrifice. In the <lb/>
            Wasps (860) fire, myrtles, and incense <lb/>
            are mentioned as the concomitants of <lb/>
            prayer: in the Frogs (871) fire and <lb/>
            incense: and here, fire and myrtles. <lb/>

            worship. Pollux i. segm. 27, 28. And <lb/>
            suppliants carried myrtle in their hands <lb/>
            when they approached the altar of the <lb/>
            gods. Thus, when Alcestis was praying <lb/>
            to the gods for her husband and children, <lb/>
            we are told <figure type="illustration">

            commences his recitative, which, though <lb/>

            reproduced, in a manner which we <lb/>

            peculiarities of his master's style. He <lb/>

              odes. Of these a specimen will be given <lb/>
              presently ; infra 101-129. The language <lb/>
              is calculated, if not designed, to recall <lb/>
              Alcman's well-known description of <lb/>
              a sleeping world, of which (as I do not <lb/>
              remember having seen it in English) <lb/>
              I venture to append not only the <lb/>
              original, but also a free translation.</p><figure type="illustration">

          <p>Now sleep the mountain summits ; cleft and rill <lb/>
            Sleep, and are still ; <lb/>
            Sleep the wild creatures, all the countless breeds <lb/>

            The bees are slumbering ; in the noiseless deep <lb/>
            The fishes sleep; <lb/>
            And long-winged birds their drowsy pinions close <lb/>

          <p>The statement here that an inspired <lb/>
            band of Muses is composing the odes <lb/>
            means of course exactly the same thing <lb/>

            (Iliad viii. 552, the breathless hush of the <lb/>
            air.—Way) is found, slightly altered, <lb/>
            in Birds 778. Lucian's <foreign xml:lang="grc">σι̑γα μὲν αἰθὴρ <lb/>
            νήνεμος ἔστω</foreign>(Tragopodagra 129) is doubt­ <lb/>
            less a mere reminiscence of the present <lb/>
            passage. Compare the expression <foreign xml:lang="grc">νηνε­ <lb/>

            the Symposium of Plato (chap. xix), <lb/>
            a peroration which elicited from Socrates <lb/>

              Some writers indeed, both ancient and <lb/>
              modern, take the <foreign xml:lang="grc">δρυόχους</foreign> themselves <lb/>
              to be the ribs of the vessel. Torr's <lb/>
              " Ancient Ships," p. 39 note. The <lb/>
              question is too long to be discussed in <lb/>
              a footnote, but I am satisfied that the <lb/>
              explanation of Eustathius is the true <lb/>
              one, and that the <foreign xml:lang="grc">δρύοχοι</foreign> were a frame­ <lb/>
              work external to the ship. And this is to <lb/>
              some extent confirmed by the present <lb/>
              passage. Agathon merely sets or erects, <lb/>
              <foreign xml:lang="grc">τίθησι</foreign>, the <foreign xml:lang="grc">δρυόχους</foreign>; he bends and <lb/>
              shapes, <foreign xml:lang="grc">κάμπτει</foreign>, the timber for the keel <lb/>
              and ribs. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἁψὶς</foreign> signifies anything cir­ <lb/>
              cular or curved, and is here applied to <lb/>

              the purpose of assisting the retort of <lb/>
              Mnesilochus. In a note on Horace A. P. <lb/>
              441 (et male tornatos incudi reddere <lb/>
              versus), Bentley translates these lines <lb/>
              as follows : flectit autem novas veresuum <lb/>
              curvaturas; nunc tornat, nunc conglu­ <lb/>
              tinat; nunc sententias ponit, nunc anto­ <lb/>
              nomasias; nunc incerat, nunc rotundat, <lb/>
              nunc conflat. <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BELL_07_fig375.jpg"/></figure> <lb/>
              thius too, on Odyssey vii. 87, connects <lb/>
              the word with <foreign xml:lang="grc">τρίχες</foreign>. And if this is <lb/>
              the true derivation, the word is, as it <lb/>
              were, the converse of our common <lb/>
              metaphor, the penthouse of the brow. <lb/>
              Mnesilochus borrows from the servant <lb/>
              the words <foreign xml:lang="grc">γογγύλλει, χοανεύει</foreign>, and <foreign xml:lang="grc">θριγ­ <lb/>
              κοι̑ς</foreign>, and gives them a different and <lb/>
              perverted signification. With him <lb/>
              <foreign xml:lang="grc">θριγκου̑</foreign> is equivalent to <foreign xml:lang="grc">πρωκτου</foreign>. The <lb/>
              words <foreign xml:lang="grc">συγγογγυλίσας καὶ συστρέψας</foreign> would <lb/>
              recall to the audience a line (975) of <lb/>
              the Lysistrata, acted in the preceding <lb/>
              year; and though he is embarrassed <lb/>
              by having to employ words not cognate <lb/>
              to his subject, "tamen apparet," says <lb/>
              Bergler, "ad quid paratum se dicat <lb/>
              Mnesilochus : est autem id, quod eum <lb/>
              Euripides dicebat antehac etiam com­ <lb/>
              misisse in Agathonem supra 35."</p>
          <p>63. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἦ που</foreign>] Perhaps the most accurate <lb/>
            rendering of these words is I guess that; <lb/>
            cf. Frogs 803, Plutus 832. The ex­ <lb/>
            pression is a favourite one with Euri­ <lb/>
            pides, and occurs nowhere so frequently <lb/>
            as in his " recent Helen." See the notes <lb/>

              it is found no less than four times, <lb/>
              viz. 575, 600, 791, 1465. It occurs <lb/>
              twice in the Phoenissae, the Supplices, <lb/>
              and the Troades, but in no other Play <lb/>
              have I observed it more than once.</p>

            summoned, as in Lysistrata 1107, Plutus <lb/>
            965, and elsewhere. At the close of <lb/>
            this speech this servant re-enters the <lb/>
            house of Agathon ; and Euripides is <lb/>
            again alone with Mnesilochus.</p>

            I have a speech all ready.</p>
          <p>79. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἕδρα</foreign>] a sitting. This vacation, so <lb/>
            to call it, would naturally be confined <lb/>
            to the <foreign xml:lang="grc">Νηστεία</foreign> or day of fasting, and <lb/>
            therefore there would be no reason to <lb/>
            doubt the statement of Xenophon (Hell. <lb/>
            V. ii. 29) that the Theban Council was <lb/>
            sitting, whilst the women in the Cad­ <lb/>

            phoria were celebrated at the same <lb/>
            time (which is not the fact) and under <lb/>
            the same conditions (which is not <lb/>
            probable) as the Athenian festival.</p>

            from <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπιβεβουλεύκασι</foreign> just above. Mnesi­ <lb/>
            lochus, knowing that his companion <lb/>
            is the prince of tricksters (infra 94) <lb/>
            with ten thousand shifts and artifices <lb/>
            at his command (infra 927), does not <lb/>
            doubt that he is provided with a scheme <lb/>
            for evading the present difficulty ; and <lb/>
            consequently his question is not "Have <lb/>
            you any scheme" but " What is your <lb/>
            scheme " for doing so ?</p>
          <p>94. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἡμέτερος ὁ πυραμου̑ς</foreign>] Ours is <lb/>
            the champion's cake. Like Dionysus <lb/>
            in Frogs 1214, he is for the moment <lb/>
            identifying himself with the art, <lb/>
            and the cause, of Euripides. The <lb/>
            phrase is repeated from Knights 277. <lb/>
            A <foreign xml:lang="grc">πυραμου̑ς</foreign> was a cake of which the <lb/>
            principal ingredients were parched <lb/>
            wheat and boiled honey, and which is <lb/>
            specially known as the prize awarded to <lb/>
            the man who in an all-night drinking­ <lb/>
            bout, with all his companions asleep <lb/>
            around him, kept awake till sunrise, <lb/>
            like Socrates in the Symposium of Plato, <lb/>
            or the doctor of tremendous paunch " <lb/>
            in Thomson's Seasons. A comic poet <lb/>
            of the name of Callippus is known to us <lb/>
            only by two lines which Athenaeus <lb/>
            (xv. chap. 7) preserves from his <foreign xml:lang="grc">Παν­ <lb/>
            νυχὶς</foreign> or "All-night Revel."</p>
          <p>Who keeps awake shall take the cake (<foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸν πυραμοΰντα λήψεται</foreign>) <lb/>
            And kiss whichever girl he pleases.</p>
          <p>And that a kiss was a recognized prize, Athenaeus goes on to say, is shown by <lb/>
            these lines of Eubulus.</p>
          <p>O Ladies, dance the whole night through, <lb/>
            And keep with mirth and joyance due <lb/>
            The tenth-day of this child of mine. <lb/>
            And I'm prepared, with bounty free, <lb/>

            of Agathon's servant, supra 36, but <lb/>
            the master and servant do not make <lb/>
            their exit in the same fashion. Here <lb/>
            by the operation of the machine called <lb/>
            the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐκκύκλημα</foreign>, the front wall of Agathon's <lb/>
            house slowly revolves outward as on <lb/>
            a hinge, bringing with it a part of the <lb/>
            interior, and discovering Agathon in <lb/>
            his chamber, preparing to sing the <lb/>
            lyrics which, as we have already been <lb/>
            informed, he has just been engaged in <lb/>
            composing. Both the chamber and its <lb/>
            occupant are arrayed in the softest and <lb/>
            most luxurious style, and Mnesilochus <lb/>
            affects to mistake the effeminate poet <lb/>
            for the courtesan Cyrene, who is men­ <lb/>
            tioned again in Frogs 1328. Brunck <lb/>
            thinks that Agathon here, like Euripides <lb/>
            in the Acharnians, is in the upper story, <lb/>
            where the women's apartments would <lb/>
            be : but considering the ease with which <lb/>
            he hands articles to the actors on the <lb/>
            stage, this seems to me very unlikely. <lb/>
            As a prelude to his songs, he gives out <lb/>
            a little fantastical warble, which in the <lb/>
            stage direction is called <foreign xml:lang="grc">μινυρισμός</foreign> <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BELL_07_fig380.jpg"/></figure> <lb/>
              <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὁδαί</foreign>.—Scholiast. The expression is in­ <lb/>
              tended to signify both the finikin and <lb/>
              the intricate character of the notes, <lb/>
              by comparing them to the tiny and <lb/>
              innumerable galleries in an ant-hill. <lb/>
              Pherecrates in the well-known passage <lb/>
              preserved by Plutarch (De Musica, <lb/>
              chap. xxx) describes as <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐκτραπέλους μυρμη­ <lb/>
              κίας</foreign> the musical novelties introduced <lb/>
              by the celebrated Timotheus of Miletus ; <lb/>
              and Meineke, in his note on that <lb/>
              fragment, refers to Aeliam (H. A. vi. 43), <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BELL_07_fig381.jpg"/></figure> <lb/>

              which the ancients attached to the <lb/>
              galleries in an ant-hill.</p>
          <p>101-129. Agathon sings the lyrical <lb/>
            dialogue which he has just composed. <lb/>
            It purports to be a dialogue between <lb/>
            a Leader and a band of female wor­ <lb/>
            shippers : but both parts are sung <lb/>
            by Agathon himself, and to insert <lb/>
            " Agathon's Chorus" amongst the Dra­ <lb/>
            matis Personae, as is universally done <lb/>
            by modern editors, from Brunck and <lb/>
            Bekker downwards, is really the height <lb/>
            of absurdity. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὁ 'Αγάθων</foreign>, says the <lb/>
            Scholiast, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὑποκριτικα μέλη τέως ποιει̑</foreign>, <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BELL_07_fig383.jpg"/></figure> <lb/>
              (He means that we are listening not <lb/>
              to a dramatic exhibition, but to a poet <lb/>
              composing verses.) <foreign xml:lang="grc">διὸ καὶ χορικὰ λέγει <lb/>
              αὐτὸς πρὸς αυτὸν, ὡς χορικὰ δέ</foreign>. And <lb/>
              indeed Aristophanes himself makes this <lb/>
              perfectly clear. The servant describes <lb/>
              Agathon alone as coming forth to mould <lb/>
              his strophes in the sun's warm rays, <lb/>
              supra 66-69 ; he alone is seen in the <lb/>
              eccyclema, supra 96 ; he alone <foreign xml:lang="grc">μελω̜δει̑ν <lb/>
              παρασκευάζεται</foreign>, supra 99 ; and when the <lb/>
              conversation is over, he alone is wheeled <lb/>
              in again, infra 265. Still, the lyrics <lb/>
              are in the form of a dialogue, and it <lb/>
              being necessary for the convenience <lb/>
              of the reader that the parts should <lb/>
              be distinguished, I have inserted (in <lb/>
              brackets) the appellations of <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὑποκριτὴς</foreign> <lb/>
              and <foreign xml:lang="grc">χορός</foreign>. It is not likely that the <lb/>
              dialogue is actually borrowed from <lb/>
              Agathon's works, but it is undoubtedly <lb/>
              intended to convey an accurate idea of <lb/>
              his style, which consisted of a series <lb/>
              of pretty conceits, destitute alike of <lb/>
              the heroic dignity of Aeschylus and <lb/>
              of the argumentative subtlety of Euri­ <lb/>
              pides. The language has been much <lb/>
              confused by transcribers, and it is <lb/>
              impossible now to recover the original <lb/>
              metrical system, which seems to have <lb/>
              been mostly choriambic and trochaic. <lb/>
              A favourite line seems to have been one <lb/>
              compounded of a paeon and a choriamb, <lb/>

              and infra 125, to signify the choral <lb/>
              song, we may surmise that this was <lb/>
              a special usage of the word by Agathon. <lb/>
              Kuster would also change <foreign xml:lang="grc">πατρίδι</foreign> into <lb/>
              <foreign xml:lang="grc">πατρία̜</foreign>, which would be probable enough <lb/>
              if it were reading the language of <lb/>
              Aristophanes, and not, in fact or in <lb/>
              imitation, the language of Agathon.</p>
          <p>104-106. <foreign xml:lang="grc">τίνι ... σεβίσαι</foreign>] To which <lb/>
            (that is, in honour of which) of the <lb/>
            deities is this revel ? Tell me now. My <lb/>
            mind is easily swayed to worship the <lb/>
            deities, <foreign xml:lang="grc">τοὐμὸν</foreign> is equivalent to <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐγὼ</foreign>, <lb/>
            and <foreign xml:lang="grc">εὐπίστως ἔχει</foreign> to <foreign xml:lang="grc">εὔπιστός εἰμι</foreign>. The <lb/>
            speakers formed the Chorus of the <lb/>
            Tragedy; but whom they represented <lb/>
            it is impossible to say. Bothe's con­ <lb/>
            jecture from lines 109, 110, that they <lb/>
            were Trojan virgins, rests on a very <lb/>
            insecure foundation : whilst nothing <lb/>
            can be more improbable than Fritzsche's <lb/>
            notion that they were the <foreign xml:lang="grc">θίασος Μουσω̑ν</foreign> <lb/>
            mentioned supra 41. Although they <lb/>
            are carrying the torches sacred to the <lb/>
            Thesmophorian goddesses, they do not <lb/>
            know whom they are to worship, and <lb/>
            are quite willing to worship any deity ; <lb/>
            and they welcome with enthusiasm the <lb/>
            information that Apollo and Artemis, <lb/>
            with their mother Leto, and the Harp <lb/>
            wherewith Apollo wakes the heavenly <lb/>
            dance, are to be the objects of their <lb/>
            immediate devotion.</p>

            Simoeis ; <foreign xml:lang="grc">ο̑ςτὴν "Ιλιον ἐτείχισεν</foreign>, as the <lb/>
            Scholiast rightly explains it. The ex­ <lb/>

            denote the Trojan land by Euripides, <lb/>
            Hec. 641. <foreign xml:lang="grc">γύαλον</foreign> too is frequently used <lb/>
            by the same poet in the sense of a <lb/>
            "hollow glade"; and is strangely <lb/>
            similar to our west-country gully or <lb/>
            goyal (see Mr. Blackmore's "Lorna <lb/>
            Doone," chap. iii) and our north- <lb/>
            country ghyll (see Wordsworth's "Idle <lb/>
            Shepherd Boys "). <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὄλβιζε</foreign> is Bentley's <lb/>
            correction of the MS. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὄπλιζε</foreign>, and is <lb/>
            unquestionably right. Just below, the <lb/>
            Chorus undertake <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὀλβίζειν " Αρτεμιν</foreign> ; and <lb/>
            the present injunction is literally <lb/>
            obeyed infra 129, <foreign xml:lang="grc">χαι̑ρ', ὄλβιε παι̑ Λατου̑ς</foreign>. <lb/>
            It seems probable that the word <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὄλβιος</foreign> <lb/>
            was a favourite one with Agathon.</p>
          <p>111-113. <foreign xml:lang="grc">χαι̑ρε ...προφέρων</foreign>] We greet <lb/>

            take <foreign xml:lang="grc">γέρας προφέρων</foreign> to mean, not award­ <lb/>
            ing, but carrying off the prize. Fritzsche, <lb/>

            the Tusculan Disputations to which Dr. <lb/>

            veighing against the dissolute poetry of <lb/>
            the Greeks. " Who knows not," says <lb/>

            Alcaeus ? Nam Anacreontis quidem tota <lb/>

            with great effect in a difference of <lb/>
            opinion which existed between the <lb/>
            grammarians Aristophanes and Didy­ <lb/>
            mus about the reading <foreign xml:lang="grc">᾽Αλκαῖος</foreign>. "In <lb/>
            some copies," says he, " the name is <lb/>
            written <foreign xml:lang="grc">᾽Αχαιὸς</foreign>, and the older copies <lb/>
            had it so. And Aristophanes it was <lb/>
            who changed it to <foreign xml:lang="grc">᾽Αλκαῖος</foreign>. For they <lb/>
            are talking of old authors, but Achaeus <lb/>
            was of later date." (He was eleven <lb/>
            years younger than (Sophocles.) "And <lb/>
            the argument of Didymus that they <lb/>

            his writings, owing to their dialect, <lb/>
            were not familiar to the public, is sheer <lb/>

              that the name Alcaeus may stand ; only <lb/>
              they are not referring to the lyric <lb/>
              Poet (repeating the old argument about <lb/>

            my own part, I cannot bring myself to <lb/>
            doubt that Aristophanes wrote <foreign xml:lang="grc">διεκι­ <lb/>
            νοῦντ᾽</foreign>, or rather <foreign xml:lang="grc">διεκινοῦνθ᾽</foreign> and that the <lb/>
            error should be sought in the adverb, <lb/>
            and not in the verb. It seems to me <lb/>
            that <foreign xml:lang="grc">᾽Ιωνικῶς</foreign> sprang from a misreading <lb/>
            of <foreign xml:lang="grc">θ᾽ ὧδέ πως</foreign>, and being very pat to the <lb/>
            meaning, though in no way necessary <lb/>
            (the idea being already implied in <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐμι­ <lb/>
            τροφόρουν</foreign>), has ever since maintained <lb/>
            its usurped position without exciting <lb/>
            suspicion. The words <foreign xml:lang="grc">διεκινοῦνθ᾽ ὧδέ <lb/>
            πως</foreign> correspond very closely to the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὡδὶ <lb/>
            διαβὰς, διακινηθεὶς τῷ σώματι</foreign> of Wasps <lb/>
            688 ; and compare Peace 35 <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὼ χεῖρέ <lb/>

            Bdelycleon in the Wasps, is giving a <lb/>
            specimen of the motus Ionicos (Horace, <lb/>
            Ode III. vi. 21). Nothing is more com­ <lb/>
            mon in Aristophanes than for a speaker <lb/>
            thus to illustrate his words. To the <lb/>

            Mnesilochus avails himself of the prin­ <lb/>
            ciple which Agathon lays down, viz. <lb/>
            that there must needs be some resem­ <lb/>
            blance between a Poet and his poetry, <lb/>
            to criticize three sorry Tragedians who <lb/>
            were always obnoxious to Aristophanes. <lb/>
            We have met with all three before. <lb/>
            Philocles, the nephew of Aeschylus, is <lb/>
            mentioned in Wasps 462 (where see <lb/>
            the note) as the waspish composer of <lb/>
            waspish tragedies. And in the closing <lb/>
            scene of the same play, Xenocles, the <lb/>
            most dwarfish of the sons of Carcinus, <lb/>
            is introduced upon the stage, to dance <lb/>
            the extravagant new dances of the <lb/>
            period in opposition to the old-fash­ <lb/>
            ioned Tragic dances of Thespis and <lb/>
            Phryniehus. In Frogs 86 the mere <lb/>
            mention of his name elicits from Diony­ <lb/>
            sus the ejaculation <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐξόλοιτο νὴ Αία</foreign>. And <lb/>
            see infra 440. Yet Philoeles carried off <lb/>
            the prize from Sophocles when the <lb/>
            latter exhibited his Oedipus Tyrannus ; <lb/>
            and Xenocles from Euripides when the <lb/>
            latter competed with his Troades. The <lb/>
            epithet <foreign xml:lang="grc">ψυχρὸς</foreign>, cold (that is dull, with­ <lb/>
            out a vivifying spark of life or genius), <lb/>
            belonged as of right to Theognis, who <lb/>
            from his excessive <foreign xml:lang="grc">ψυχρότης</foreign> had ac­ <lb/>
            quired the nickname of <foreign xml:lang="grc">Χιὼν</foreign>, Snow : see <lb/>
            the Scholiast on Ach. 11. In Ach. 140 <lb/>
            it is noticed as a curious coincidence <lb/>
            that whilst the Athenian ambassadors <lb/>
            were detained in Thrace by frost and <lb/>
            snow, the Athenian stage was occupied <lb/>
            by the tragedies of Theognis. There <lb/>
            was a Theognis among the Thirty <pb n="23"/>

              Tyrants ; and the Scholiast on Ach. 11, <lb/>
              who is copied by Suidas, asserts that <lb/>
              the Poet and the Tyrant were one and <lb/>
              the same person. The <foreign xml:lang="grc">ψυχρότης</foreign> of <lb/>
              Theognis is immortalized by the jest <lb/>
              of Aristophanes ; the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ψυχρότης</foreign> of Di­ <lb/>
              philus, a later dramatist, is immor­ <lb/>
              talized by a jest of the witty and <lb/>
              dissolute Gnathaena :— <lb/>
              Quoth Diphilus " Upon my word, <lb/>
              Gnathaena’s wine is cold as snow.” <lb/>
              “Why yes,” Gnathaena says, “ we poured <lb/>
              Your dramas in, to make it so." <lb/>
              Machon apud Athen. xiii. cap. 43.</p>
          <p>Or rather “we pour” ; we are in the <lb/>
            habit of doing so: it is a recipe we have.</p>

            pret it of Agathon's womanly practice <lb/>
            and inquires what method he follows. <lb/>
            But by this time the patience of Euri­ <lb/>
            pides is exhausted : he thinks that <lb/>
            Mnesilochus has already monopolized <lb/>
            the conversation too long ; and accord­ <lb/>
            ingly bids him stop that yapping,” <lb/>
            and allow him to unfold the errand of <lb/>
            life or death which has brought him to <lb/>

            <foreign xml:lang="grc">φέρειν τεχνάσμασιν</foreign> must here be taken <lb/>
            to mean " to endeavour to escape <lb/>

            with artifices," as Euripides is now <lb/>
            doing.</p>

          <p>205. <foreign xml:lang="grc">κλέπτειν</foreign>] Euripides will be de­ <lb/>

            woman’s part, and to steal away, by <lb/>
            attracting to himself, the love which <lb/>

            The idea of this depilation scene seems <lb/>
            to have been borrowed from a Play of <lb/>

            are two names of the same Play. And <lb/>
            Bergk conjectures that the Chorus con­ <lb/>
            sisted of Idaean Dactyls, who, it is <lb/>
            likely enough, smoothed their bodies <lb/>
            and singed off their superfluous hair, <lb/>
            as the effeminate ministers of the Phry­ <lb/>

          <p>249. ’<foreign xml:lang="grc">Αγάθων κ.τ.λ</foreign>.] The person of <lb/>
            Mnesilochus, being now smoothed and <lb/>
            denuded of hair, has next to be attired <lb/>
            in female clothing. They know that <lb/>
            Agathon can supply them with this, <lb/>
            since he himself, as we have already <lb/>
            seen, is partly equipped as a woman. <lb/>
            The costume of men, and the costume <lb/>
            of women, were in many respects widely <lb/>
            different, but the ground-work of both <lb/>
            was the same. Each consisted of two <lb/>
            main articles of apparel, (1) a <foreign xml:lang="grc">χιτὼν</foreign>, <lb/>
            tunic, or body-robe, which was put on <lb/>
            (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐνδύου</foreign>, infra 253), and covering the <lb/>
            shoulders, reached, in the case of <lb/>
            women, to the feet; and (2) an <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἱμάτιον</foreign>, <lb/>
            or outer mantle, loosely thrown over one <lb/>
            shoulder, and drawn underneath the <lb/>
            other. The <foreign xml:lang="grc">χιτὼν</foreign> was an <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἔνδυμα</foreign>, the <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἱμάτιον</foreign> was a <foreign xml:lang="grc">περίβλημα</foreign>. Here the body- <lb/>
            robe is called <foreign xml:lang="grc">κροκωτὸς</foreign>, and the outer <lb/>
            mantle <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἔγκυκλον</foreign>, very common names <lb/>
            in women's costume ; the former from <lb/>
            its yellow colour, the latter, probably, <lb/>
            from its rounded shape. See the notes <lb/>
            on Eccl. 318, 333, and 536. The <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">στρόφιον</foreign> was the sash or girdle which <lb/>
            tied in the <foreign xml:lang="grc">κροκωτὸς</foreign> underneath the <lb/>
            paps. Agathon has also to furnish <lb/>
            a net and hair-band for the head, and <lb/>
            a pair of women's slippers for the feet, <lb/>
            and the toilet is complete. It must be <lb/>
            remembered that he is at this moment <lb/>
            attired in a <foreign xml:lang="grc">κροκωτὸς</foreign>, a <foreign xml:lang="grc">στρόφιον</foreign>, a <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">κεκρύφαλος</foreign>, and women's slippers, supra <lb/>
            138-42. The arrangement of the <lb/>
            speeches during the toilet scene is very <lb/>
            uncertain, but it seems that Agathon <lb/>
            points out the various articles; Euri­ <lb/>
            pides takes them and dresses Mnesilo­ <lb/>
            chus, whilst the latter, after the painful <lb/>
            experiences of the shaving and singeing <lb/>
            operations, cannot conceal his delight <lb/>
            at finding himself arrayed in these soft <lb/>
            and comfortable garments.</p>
          <p>250. <foreign xml:lang="grc">τουτῳί</foreign>] For the use of Mnesilo­ <lb/>

            in the general sense of " a garment," <lb/>
            and not in the special sense mentioned <lb/>

            cap and snood. This was the head-dress <lb/>
            of Andromache, which Homer describes <lb/>
            as <foreign xml:lang="grc">κεκρύφαλόν τ'ἠδὲ πλεκτὴν ἀναδέσμην</foreign> <lb/>
            II. xxii. 469. The <foreign xml:lang="grc">κεκρύφαλος</foreign> was a cap <lb/>
            for confining the hair, and was doubtless <lb/>
            made in divers shapes and of divers <lb/>
            materials. Sometimes it was a plain <lb/>
            kerchief (<foreign xml:lang="grc">κεκρύφαλον' σουδάριον</foreign>.—Pho­ <lb/>
            tius), such as the Arnaut women still <lb/>
            wear upon their heads.—Dodwell, i. 141. <lb/>
            Sometimes it was a net, such as is <lb/>
            shown on Pompeian frescoes, " a net­ <lb/>
            work which confined, and more or less <lb/>
            concealed the hair." — Gladstone's <lb/>
            Homeric Synchronism, p. 50. Its func­ <lb/>
            tions are briefly described in an Epigram <lb/>
            which appears in a double form in the <lb/>
            Anthology (Antipater Sidonius 21 ; <lb/>
            Archias 5). In that epigram five sisters <lb/>
            are bringing gifts to the Heavenly <lb/>
            Aphrodite, and one of them, Philaenis <lb/>
            by name, offers a <foreign xml:lang="grc">κεκρύφαλος</foreign>. In the <lb/>
            first version it is said, <figure type="illustration">

              And in the second, <figure type="illustration">

              <foreign xml:lang="grc">μίτρα</foreign> means simply a band. As a part <lb/>
              of the headgear it was probably a ribbon <lb/>
              tying the <foreign xml:lang="grc">κεκρύφαλος</foreign>, and curbing the <lb/>
              too luxuriant tresses. Catullus, describing <lb/>
              the reckless grief of the deserted Ariadne, <lb/>
              as she watched the receding ship which <lb/>
              was carrying from her the faithless <lb/>
              Theseus, says that she looked like <lb/>
              a frenzied Maenad, non flavo retinens <lb/>

              The use of the <foreign xml:lang="grc">μίτρα</foreign> as a hair-band <lb/>
              seems to have commenced amongst the <lb/>
              Asiatics (Hdt. i. 195, vii. 62, 90 ; cf. <lb/>
              Eur. Hec. 924, Bacchae 833), amongst <lb/>
              whom it was common to men and <pb n="30"/>

              <graphic url="ENG_BELL_07_fig406.jpg"/></figure> <lb/>
              women ; but amongst the Hellenes in <lb/>
              Europe its use by a man was accounted <lb/>
              an act of the grossest effeminacy. See <lb/>
              supra 163. " I should be ashamed, <lb/>
              Zeus," says Hera, speaking of Dionysus, <lb/>
              " to have a son so effeminate and <lb/>
              drunken, whose hair is bound up with <lb/>
              a mitra," <foreign xml:lang="grc">μίτρᾳ ἀναδεδεμένος τὴν κόμην</foreign>, <lb/>
              Lucian xviiith. Dialogue of the Gods.</p>
          <p>258. <foreign xml:lang="grc">κεφαλὴ περίθετος</foreign>] a hood or coif; <lb/>
            literally a put-on head ; a strange name <lb/>
            for a woman's head-dress, but one which <lb/>
            is recognized, as Kuster observes, by <lb/>
            both Pollux (ii. segm. 35) and Eustathius <lb/>
            (at II. xxii. 470) ; the latter writer <lb/>
            calling it <foreign xml:lang="grc">κόσμος γυναικεῖος</foreign> "an article <lb/>
            of womanly adornment," and expressing <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BELL_07_fig407.jpg"/></figure> <lb/>
              <foreign xml:lang="grc">τῆς ἀναδέμης</foreign>. Here it is plain that <lb/>
              Agathon offers it, and Euripides receives <lb/>
              it, as a substitute for both <foreign xml:lang="grc">κεκρύφαλος</foreign> <lb/>
              and <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀναδέσμη</foreign>. It was doubtless a hood, <lb/>
              fitting close to, and so assuming the <lb/>
              shape of, its wearer's head, whence it <lb/>
              itself obtained the name of <foreign xml:lang="grc">κεφαλή</foreign>. <lb/>
              And, being something like the nightcaps <lb/>
              which English ladies used to wear, it <lb/>
              was quite capable of doing duty for <lb/>
              both <foreign xml:lang="grc">κεκρύφαλος</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">μίτρα</foreign>. And this is <lb/>
              the meaning, as Hermann and Enger <lb/>
              perceived, of the Scholium, <foreign xml:lang="grc">πάντα ἒχουσα <lb/>

            whereon it was lying. The form <foreign xml:lang="grc">κλινὶς</foreign> <lb/>
            is employed to illustrate the effeminacy <lb/>
            of Agathon, since it was specially appro­ <lb/>
            priated to the luxurious carriage-seat <lb/>
            which a newly-married bride occupied <lb/>
            between the bridegroom and the grooms­ <lb/>

            than Agathon, doubts if he can get his <lb/>
            own feet into them ; and when he finds <lb/>
            that he can, he says to Agathon, " Why <lb/>
            then you like to wear loose shoes." <pb n="31"/>

              again. Apparently he has not left his <lb/>

              His house is now closed up, and we <lb/>

            also " make liquid treble of that bassoon, <lb/>
            his throat" ; and doubtless he utters <lb/>
            the word <foreign xml:lang="grc">πειράσομαι</foreign> in a "monstrous <lb/>
            little voice," to imitate the tone of <lb/>
            a woman.</p>
          <p>272. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὂμνυμι τοίνυν</foreign>] This line is quoted <lb/>
            from the Melanippe sapiens (see the <lb/>
            note on line 14 above), except that <lb/>
            Aristophanes substitutes <foreign xml:lang="grc">τοίνυν</foreign> for the <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">δ' ἰερὸν</foreign> of the original. See Frogs 100 <lb/>
            and the note there. Mnesilochus does <lb/>
            not see the sense of swearing by a <lb/>
            dwelling-place, and thinks that Euri­ <lb/>
            pides might as well swear by the <lb/>
            lodgings in which Hippocrates and his <lb/>
            swinish brood (of whom we have heard <lb/>
            in Clouds 1001) are herding together. <lb/>
            Euripides, to satisfy him, proceeds to <lb/>
            swear by all the gods in a lump. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἂρδη</foreign>&gt; <lb/>
            is a metaphor from the act of dragging <lb/>
            up something by the very roots, so as to <lb/>
            leave nothing behind ; and <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἂρδην πάντες</foreign>, <lb/>
            therefore, both here and in Phoenissae, <lb/>
            1146 (to which Dr. Blaydes refers), <lb/>
            means all without exception or reserva­ <lb/>
            tion. With this wholesale swearing <lb/>
            Bergler compares Medea, 746-52, where <lb/>
            the heroine calls upon Aegeus to swear <lb/>
            by " the Earth, the Sun, <foreign xml:lang="grc">εῶν τε ... ἂπαν <lb/>
            γένος</foreign>." The terms of the oath are now <lb/>
            satisfactory; but Mnesilochus, mindful <lb/>
            of the famous line in the Hippolytus, <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἠ γλῶσσ' ὀμὠμοκ' ἠ δὲ φρὴν ἀνώμοτος</foreign> (as <lb/>
            to which see Frogs 1471 and the note <lb/>
            there), wishes to be sure that in this <lb/>
            case the oath goes deeper than the <lb/>

            science. The words <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐδ' ὢρκωσ' ἐγὼ</foreign> <lb/>
            mean nor did I so put the oath. It was <lb/>
            not to your tongue only that I ad­ <lb/>
            ministered it.</p><pb n="32"/>

          <p>277. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἒκσπευδε ταχέως</foreign>] The <foreign xml:lang="grc">παρεπιγραφὴ</foreign> <lb/>
            or stage-direction which immediately <lb/>
            precedes these words indicates an entire <lb/>
            change of scene ; the Thesmophorium, <lb/>
            or temple of Demeter and Persephone, <lb/>
            being thrust out upon the stage, while <lb/>
            the Chorus are crowding into the <lb/>
            orchestra with lighted torches and loud <lb/>
            religious cries, but without any formal <lb/>
            entrance-song. The change was effected <lb/>
            by means of the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐξώστρα</foreign>, machinery <lb/>
            considered by some grammarians, but <lb/>
            wrongly, to be identical with the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐκκὐ­ <lb/>
            κλημα</foreign>. Indeed, even here, the Scholiast <lb/>
            says <foreign xml:lang="grc">παρεπιγραφή ἐκκυκλεῖται ἐπὶ</foreign> TO <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἒξω <lb/>
            τὸ εσμοφόριον</foreign>. The <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐκκύκλημα</foreign> had a <lb/>
            circular movement on a pivot (<foreign xml:lang="grc">περιστρέ­ <lb/>
            φεται</foreign>.—Scholiast Ach. 408 ; Suidas), <lb/>
            the front wall of the house opening <lb/>
            like a door, and disclosing, and bringing <lb/>
            out with itself, the interior chambers. <lb/>
            There was no <foreign xml:lang="grc">περιστροφὴ</foreign> with the <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐξώστρα</foreign>, nor any disclosure of what was <lb/>
            taking place within ; it simply pushed <lb/>
            something straight out upon the stage. <lb/>
            Nor was it so temporary an expedient <lb/>
            as the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐκκύκλημα</foreign>, which merely disclosed <lb/>
            the interior, without otherwise inter­ <lb/>
            rupting the scene. The <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐξώστρα</foreign> created <lb/>
            a new scene, which might continue, and <lb/>
            in the present case apparently did con­ <lb/>
            tinue, to the very end of the Play; <lb/>
            whilst in the Peace it continued from <lb/>
            173 to 729, the commencement of the <lb/>
            Para basis. The temple, so brought <lb/>
            forward, has on it a <foreign xml:lang="grc">σημεῖον</foreign>, probably <lb/>
            a pole or standard of some sort, to <lb/>
            signify that an <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐκκλησία</foreign> is about to <lb/>
            commence, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὂτε ἒμελλε γίνεσθαι ἐκκλησία</foreign>, <lb/>
            says the Scholiast, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ημεῖον ἐτίθετο. οὒτως <lb/>
            οὖν, καὶ τῶν γυναικῶν μελλουσῶν ἐκκλησιά­ <lb/>
            ζειν, σημεῖον τίθεται</foreign>. See Wasps 690 and <lb/>
            the note there. Though Mnesilochus <lb/>
            does not really leave the stage, yet, as <lb/>
            the scene suddenly changes from Aga­ <lb/>
            thon's house to the temple, he must be <lb/>
            imagined to pass from the one to the <lb/>
            other, and hence the exhortation <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἒκ­ <lb/>
            σπευδε</foreign>. Euripides now makes off, and <lb/>
            Mnesilochus, gathering his woman's <lb/>
            dress about him, begins to speak in <lb/>
            a fussy way, and with a woman's voice <lb/>
            (<foreign xml:lang="grc">μιμεῖται τὴν φωνὴν γυναικός</foreign>.—Scholiast) <lb/>
            to an imaginary servant-girl.</p>
          <p>281. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὂσον τὸ χρῆμ</foreign>.'] These words are <lb/>
            usually accompanied by a genitive, TO <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">χρῆμα τῶν νυκτῶν</foreign> (or <foreign xml:lang="grc">τῶν κόπων</foreign>, or <foreign xml:lang="grc">παρνό­ <lb/>
            πων</foreign>, or otherwise) <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὂσον</foreign>.But here and <lb/>
            in Peace 1192 they stand alone, and in <lb/>
            each passage mean What a crowd of <pb n="33"/>

              <graphic url="ENG_BELL_07_fig411.jpg"/></figure> <lb/>
              people. He uses the compound <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀνέρ­ <lb/>
              χεται</foreign>, because the worshippers had to <lb/>
              ascend to the Thesmophorium. which <lb/>
              stood on elevated ground. See 585 <lb/>
              infra and the note there. They have <lb/>
              flaming torches in their hands, and the <lb/>
              fiery vapour (<foreign xml:lang="grc">λιγνις</foreign>, a word used thrice <lb/>
              only in these Comedies, once in each of <lb/>
              three successive Plays, the Birds, the <lb/>
              Lysistrata, and the Thesmophoriazusae) <lb/>
              keeps rising from these torches and <lb/>
              flaring and flickering over their heads.</p>
          <p>285. <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸ πόανον</foreign>] The <foreign xml:lang="grc">πόπνον</foreign> was <lb/>
            a small wheaten cake, round and flat, <lb/>
            much used in sacrifices. <foreign xml:lang="grc">πόπανα πλα­ <lb/>
            κούντια ἀπὸ ἂρτου</foreign>.—Hesychius. <foreign xml:lang="grc">πλακούν­ <lb/>
            τια πλατέα καὶ λεπτὰ, καὶ περιερῆ</foreign>.— <lb/>
            Photius, Scholiast on Lucian's Cataplus <lb/>
            2, and (with <foreign xml:lang="grc">πέμματα</foreign> for <foreign xml:lang="grc">πλακούντια</foreign>) <lb/>
            Timaeus, where see Ruhnken's note.</p>
          <p>288. <foreign xml:lang="grc">θύειν ἒχουσαν</foreign>] These words are <lb/>
            probably to be taken together, to keep <lb/>
            on sacrificing; a meaning more com­ <lb/>
            monly associated with the singular <lb/>
            masculine, Clouds 509; Birds 341 ; Lys. <lb/>
            945 ; Frogs 202, 512, 524 ; Eccl. 853, <lb/>
            1151. This seems a more probable con­ <lb/>
            struction than to connect <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἒχουσαν</foreign> with <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ρολλὰ</foreign> in the preceding line. The infini­ <lb/>
            tives are governed by <foreign xml:lang="grc">δότε</foreign> understood.</p>
          <p>289. <foreign xml:lang="grc">Χορίον</foreign>] He prays for his boy <lb/>
            and girl, just as Alcestis on her death- <lb/>
            bed is represented as praying for hers. <lb/>
            Only the children for whom Mnesi­ <lb/>
            lochus prays are merely the offspring <lb/>
            of his own imagination. He gives them <lb/>
            names to signify their sex. The girl is <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">Χοιρίον</foreign> from <foreign xml:lang="grc">χοῖρος</foreign> in the sense of the <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">γυναικεῖον αἰδοῖον</foreign> ; and the boy <foreign xml:lang="grc">Ποσθάληκος</foreign> <lb/>
            (like <foreign xml:lang="grc">πόσθων</foreign> in Peace 1300) from <foreign xml:lang="grc">πόσθη</foreign> <lb/>
            (Clouds 1014) or <foreign xml:lang="grc">πόσθιον</foreign> (supra 254, <lb/>
            infra 515). On the girl's name the <lb/>
            Scholiast remarks, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὠς τῆς θυγατρὸς αὐτοῖ <lb/>
            κατ ἐπίκλησιν οὒτω καλουμένης, οἶον Βοἶδιον, <lb/>
            ἦ Χρυσιον, ἦ Μυρτίον</foreign> (all pet names, the <lb/>
            last being the equivalent of <foreign xml:lang="grc">Χοιρίον</foreign>). For <lb/>
            her, he prays that she may become the <lb/>
            wife of a wealthy husband, not over­ <lb/>
            burdened with brains, and so easily <lb/>
            outwitted ; <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀναισθήτου καὶ μωροῦ</foreign>, says <lb/>
            the Scholiast, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἲνα κρατῇ αὐτοῦ</foreign>.In <lb/>
            the long passage cited by Athenaeus <lb/>
            (vi. chap. 30, 236 f) from the <foreign xml:lang="grc">Κόλακες</foreign> of <lb/>
            Eupolis (to which Bergler also refers) <lb/>
            the chorus of Flatterers say, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπειδὰν­ <lb/>
            κατίδω τιν' ἂνδρα</foreign> I <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἠλίθιον, πλουτοῦντα δ', <lb/>
            εὐθὺς περὶ τοῦτον εἰμί</foreign>. For the son, he <lb/>
            prays that he may develop into a wise <lb/>
            and understanding man, <foreign xml:lang="grc">νοῦν</foreign> exopTa <foreign xml:lang="grc">καὶ <lb/>

          <p>292. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὲν καλῷ κ.τ.λ</foreign>.] a good place for <lb/>
            hearing the speeches. The prayer is over <lb/>
            and he is again the fussy Athenian <lb/>
            matron.</p>
          <p>294. <foreign xml:lang="grc">δούλοις</foreign>] Doubtless none but free­ <lb/>
            born women (<foreign xml:lang="grc">εὺγενεῐς γυναῐκες</foreign>, infra 330, <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὃσαι πάρεσμεν ὰσταὶ</foreign>, infra 541) could <lb/>
            take part in the actual deliberations, <lb/>
            but it seems that servants were allowed <lb/>
            to accompany their mistresses into the <lb/>
            precinets. See infra 537, and the next <lb/>
            note. Mnesilochus, however, is speaking <lb/>
            to an imaginary Thratta, and gets rid <lb/>
            of her by this excuse.</p>
          <p>295. KHPYKAINA] Now the women's <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὲκκλησία</foreign> begins. The prayers and invo­ <lb/>
            cations which follow, consisting of two <lb/>
            exhortations by the Crieress, and two <lb/>
            responsive hymns by the Chorus, are <lb/>
            modelled on the preliminaries of an <lb/>
            Athenian <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὲκκλησία</foreign>, but are varied by <lb/>
            allusions to the Thesmophorian worship, <lb/>
            and still more by alterations conse­ <lb/>
            quent on the sex of the ecclesiasts. <lb/>
            Throughout the ensuing scenes there <lb/>
            are never more than three speakers on <lb/>
            the stage at once (1) Mnesilochus, <lb/>
            the Crieress, and the First Woman ; <lb/>
            (2) Mnesilochus and the two Women ; <lb/>
            (3) Mnesilochus and the First Woman ; <lb/>
            (4) Mnesilochus, the First Woman, and <lb/>
            Cleisthenes; (5) Mnesilochus and the <lb/>
            First Woman ; (6) Mnesilochus and <lb/>
            the First and Third Women ; and (7) <lb/>
            Mnesilochus and the Third Woman. <lb/>
            But there were many mute personages, <lb/>
            the <foreign xml:lang="grc">δουλάρια</foreign> of 537, the nurse of 609, <lb/>
            the <foreign xml:lang="grc">τάσδε</foreign> of 726, and the Mania of 728 <lb/>
            and 754. And of course the Chorus in <lb/>
            the orchestra form part of the body of <lb/>
            worshippers. This bidding-prayer is in <lb/>
            prose, but in the MSS. and in all the <lb/>
            older editions it is arranged in lines of <lb/>
            unequal length ; an arrangement re­ <lb/>
            tained by both Fritzsche and Enger, and <lb/>
            one which renders the proclamation so <lb/>
            much more distinct and impressive, <lb/>
            that I have not hesitated to follow their <lb/>
            example. The Scholiast says—<foreign xml:lang="grc">πεζῇ εὺ</foreign>­ <figure type="illustration">

              seqq. and 1661) <foreign xml:lang="grc">εὶσάγωσιν</foreign>. But this is <lb/>
              not an invariable rule.</p>

              parture from the ordinary formula <lb/>
              consists in the substitution of an en­ <lb/>
              tirely new group of divinities, for the <lb/>
              assembly to invoke. These are the two <lb/>
              Thesmophorian Goddesses, and Lhe <lb/>
              Powers whose worship was connected <lb/>
              with theirs. See Müller's Eumenides, <lb/>
              § 86, and Greek Literature, chap. ii. <lb/>
              Even the Graces took part in escorting <lb/>
              Persephone from the world below. See <lb/>
              the note on Frogs 453. On <foreign xml:lang="grc">Πλούτῳ</foreign> the <lb/>
              Scholiast remarks, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὼς ὰνδρὶ τῆς Περσε­ <lb/>
              φόνης</foreign>, whether as reading <foreign xml:lang="grc">Πλούτωνι</foreign>, or <lb/>
              as considering <foreign xml:lang="grc">Πλοῡτος</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">Πλούτων</foreign> to <lb/>
              be interchangeable names. The con­ <lb/>
              nexion between <foreign xml:lang="grc">Πλούτων</foreign> and the twain <lb/>
              Goddesses, and their connexion again, <lb/>
              as the givers of harvest, with <foreign xml:lang="grc">Πλοῡτος</foreign>, <lb/>
              aided by the similarity of the names <lb/>
              <foreign xml:lang="grc">Πλούτων</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">Πλοῡτος</foreign>, seem to have <lb/>
              brought about a sort of amalgamation <lb/>
              between these two Gods. Here <foreign xml:lang="grc">Πλοῡτος</foreign> <lb/>
              is used for <foreign xml:lang="grc">Πλούτων</foreign>, whilst in Plutus <lb/>
              727 (where see Spanheim's note) <foreign xml:lang="grc">Πλούτων</foreign> <lb/>
              is, conversely, used for <foreign xml:lang="grc">Πλοῡτος</foreign>. In Plato's <lb/>
              Cratylus, chap. xix (403 A), Socrates <lb/>
              says that <foreign xml:lang="grc">Πλούτων</foreign> obtained his name <lb/>
              <foreign xml:lang="grc">κατὰ τὴν τοῡ πλούτου δόσιν, ὃτι ὲκ τῆς γῆς <lb/>
              κάτωθεν ὰνίεται ό πλοῡτος</foreign>. And Plutus <lb/>
              himself gives much the same explana­ <lb/>
              tion of Pluto's name in Lucian's Timon <lb/>
              21. As to Calligeneia, a name applied <lb/>
              originally to Persephone herself, and <lb/>
              afterwards to one of her handmaidens, <lb/>
              see the remarks in the Introduction. <lb/>
              She is described by the Scholiast here</p><figure type="illustration">

            nursing mother, the rearer of youth. <lb/>
            There was, Pausanias informs us (At­ <lb/>
            tica xxii. 3, a passage to which Kuster <lb/>
            indirectly refers), a temple <foreign xml:lang="grc">Γῆς Κουρο­ <lb/>
            τρόΦου καὶ Δήμητρος Χλόης</foreign> close to the <lb/>
            Acropolis of Athens: doubtless the <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὶερὸν τῆς Γῆς</foreign> which Thucydides (ii. 15) <lb/>
            mentions as close to the Acropolis, and <lb/>
            the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὶερὸν τῆς χλόης</foreign> (Lys. 835), beside <lb/>
            which Cinesias is first espied by Lysi­ <lb/>
            strata and the female garrison of the <lb/>

          <p>312. <foreign xml:lang="grc">δεχόμεθα</foreign>] This is the choral re­ <lb/>
            sponse to the bidding-prayer ; and it is <lb/>
            noteworthy that the singers invoke not <lb/>
            the group of divinities mentioned by <lb/>
            the Crieress, but an entirely different <lb/>
            group, which in all probability consists <lb/>
            of the Gods really invoked at the <lb/>
            opening of the Athenian <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὲκκλησία</foreign>. They <lb/>
            are Zens the supreme God ; Athene and <lb/>
            Poseidon, the rival claimants for the <lb/>
            possession of Athens ; Apollo and Arte­ <lb/>
            mis ; and the Nymphs of the Sea and <lb/>
            the Mountain. Observe too how gold <lb/>
            is everywhere considered the attribute <lb/>

            which Pindar celebrates with such <lb/>

            of an Athenian Assembly, and to which <lb/>
            the Orators are constantly referring. <lb/>

              'Apa is read aloud. Unfortunately, its <lb/>
              exact terms are nowhere preserved, but <lb/>
              enough may be gathered from the <lb/>
              speeches to satisfy us that we have here <lb/>
              a faithful parody or imitation of it. <lb/>
              The statement of Andocides (De Myst. <lb/>
              95) that the 'Apa was a <foreign xml:lang="grc">νόμος Σόλωνος</foreign>, <lb/>
              though inaccurate, is not quite so <lb/>
              "perfectly reckless and unmeaning" <lb/>
              as Mr. Grote (chap. lxii) pronounced <lb/>
              it. For we now know (from Aristotle's <lb/>
              Polity of Athens, chap. 16 ad fin.) <lb/>
              that in its origin it was so. And cf. <lb/>
              Demosthenes de F. L. 78 (p. 363). Solon's <lb/>
              law ran, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὲάντινες τυραννεῑν ὲπανιστῶνται <lb/>
              ὲπὶ τυραννίδι, ἢ τὴν τυραννίδα τιςσυγκαθιστῇ, <lb/>
              ἂτιμον εἶναι καὶ αὺτὸν καὶ γένος</foreign>. This <lb/>
              would naturally be much strengthened <lb/>
              after the expulsion of the Peisistratidae, <lb/>
              and the Scholiast on 339 is doubtless <lb/>
              right in saying <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὲκτῆς κατάρας τῆς ὲπὶ τοῑς <lb/>

              This part of the '<foreign xml:lang="grc">Αρὰ</foreign> was afterwards <lb/>
              largely expanded by the Psephism of <lb/>
              Demophantus, passed, Lycurgus (against <lb/>
              Leocratcs §§ 127-131) tells us, after the <lb/>
              overthrow of the Thirty, the actual words <lb/>
              of which are given us by Andocides. <lb/>
              Every Athenian was to swear that he <lb/>
              would, if possible, slay with his own <lb/>

            parate clauses or articles, like those in <lb/>
            our Commination Service. The pre­ <lb/>
            sent clause was inserted by Aristeides <lb/>
            shortly after the termination of the <lb/>

            legal formula expressive of an intent to <lb/>
            damage. Isocrates in three different <lb/>
            orations (Panegyricus 149, De Pace 87, <lb/>
            Panathenaicus 237) contrasts a deed <lb/>

            Schömann (De Corn. i. 8) is no doubt <lb/>
            right in deriving this line from the <lb/>
            curse which, it appears from Demo­ <lb/>
            sthenes de F. L. 78-80 (p. 363), was <lb/>

            In the next line the copula <foreign xml:lang="grc">καὶ</foreign> connects <lb/>
            the two verbs <foreign xml:lang="grc">δίδωσι</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">δέχεται</foreign> in such <lb/>

              bribes to desert her lover for a wealthier <lb/>
              paramour." The '<foreign xml:lang="grc">Αρὰ</foreign>, as Schömann <lb/>
              points out, included those who took <lb/>
              bribes <foreign xml:lang="grc">κατὰ τῆς πόλεως</foreign>, Deinarchus ubi <lb/>
              supra. And probably the words <foreign xml:lang="grc">προδι­ <lb/>

            Comedies Aristophanes enjoys a little <lb/>

            Athenian women. The present denun­ <lb/>
            ciation is launched against any vintner <lb/>
            (male or female) who gives them short <lb/>
            measure in their winecups. A <foreign xml:lang="grc">κοτύλη</foreign> <lb/>
            was about half-a-pint; a <foreign xml:lang="grc">χοῦς</foreign> was <lb/>
            nearly six pints ; <foreign xml:lang="grc">νόμισμα</foreign> is " the stan­ <lb/>
            dard measure " and may well have been <lb/>

            the offence of clipping the current <lb/>
            coin. <foreign xml:lang="grc">διαλυμαίνσθαι</foreign> is " to tamper with, <lb/>
            to cut short, to injure." Bergler has <lb/>
            already referred to Plutus 435, where <lb/>

            decessors, the line was originally in the <lb/>
            glyconic metre, and I have inserted <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">εὐμενὲς</foreign> in brackets, rather to show a <lb/>
            possible, than as thinking it the true, <lb/>

            Aristophanes treats it here as a pitcher <lb/>

            not indeed from the Aeolus, as Fritzsche <lb/>
            suggests, since there the brother was <lb/>
            the corrupter, and not (as here) the sus­ <lb/>
            picious guardian, of his sister's inno­ <lb/>

            to give birth to a child, which is really <lb/>
            somebody else's child, secretly smuggled <lb/>
            into her bed. See the note on 340 <lb/>
            supra. She is really making the very <lb/>
            charges, which create such indigna­ <lb/>
            tion when Mnesilochus makes them, <lb/>

            cited by Stobaeus (Ixxi. 1) from the <lb/>
            Phoenix of Euripides. He was not the <lb/>
            only poet who gave utterance to this <lb/>

          <p>414. <foreign xml:lang="grc">διὰ τοῦτον</foreign>] through him; by <lb/>
            reason of his teaching. Bergler thinks, <lb/>
            with great probability, that the speaker <lb/>
            is alluding to the Danae of Euripides, <lb/>
            where the heroine was certainly repre­ <lb/>
            sented as guarded by bolts and bars <lb/>
            and seals ; and as to the watch-dogs, <lb/>
            Fritzsche refers to the commencement <lb/>
            of Horace's Ode (iii. 16) " Inclusam <lb/>
            Danaen turris aenea Robustaeque fores <lb/>
            et rigilum canum Tristes excubiae mu­ <lb/>
            nierant satis Nocturnis ab adulteris," <lb/>
            where the precautions described are <lb/>
            very possibly borrowed from the Attic <lb/>
            tragedy.</p>
          <p>416. <foreign xml:lang="grc">Μολοττικούς</foreign>] Aristotle (de Ani­ <lb/>
            mal. Hist. ix. 1) mentions two well- <lb/>
            known breeds of Molossian dogs: (1) <lb/>
            hounds for sporting, which however, <lb/>
            he says, were not in any special manner <lb/>
            distinguished from other sporting dogs, <lb/>
            and (2) the large, powerful, and coura­ <lb/>
            geous sheep-dogs, which are the " Mo­ <lb/>
            lossian dogs" of literature. Veloces <lb/>

          <p>417. <foreign xml:lang="grc">μορμολυκεῖα</foreign>] The word here <lb/>
            signifies real terrors, but it generally <lb/>

          <p>421. <foreign xml:lang="grc">κλειδία</foreign>] Pliny (N. H. vii. 57) <lb/>
            attributes the invention of the key to <lb/>
            Theodorus of Samos, apparently a COIl­ <lb/>
            temporary of Solon ; though there is <lb/>
            much doubt as to his date, and also <lb/>
            whether there were not more artists <lb/>
            than one bearing that name. The <lb/>
            earliest keys were very simple, the part <lb/>
            which turned the lock being merely <lb/>
            a flat piece of wood without any <lb/>
            division : <foreign xml:lang="grc">μονοβάλανα</foreign>, the Scholiast calls <lb/>
            them. But soon locks were framed <lb/>
            with complicated wards, and keys with <lb/>
            complicated steps as they are now <lb/>
            technically called; teeth, as the ancients <lb/>
            called them ; <foreign xml:lang="grc">γομφίους, οὓς ἡμει̑ς ὀδόντας</foreign>, <lb/>
            says the Scholiast; "seu reserat fixo <lb/>
            dente puella fores," Tibullus, I. ii. 18. <lb/>
            See Frogs 572. The Laconian keys en­ <lb/>
            joyed a great celebrity, and are fre­ <lb/>
            quently mentioned by ancient writers : <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">περιβόητοί εἰσιν αί Λακωνικαὶ κλει̑ες</foreign>, the <lb/>
            Scholiast tells us. And he cites a line <lb/>
            from Menander's <foreign xml:lang="grc">Μισούμενος</foreign> ("The man <lb/>
            who was hated") <foreign xml:lang="grc">Λακωνικὴ κλείς ἐστιν <lb/>
            ὡς ἔοικε μοι περιοιστέα</foreign>. And Brunck <lb/>
            refers to Plautus, Mostellaria, II. i. 57, <lb/>
            where Tranio says (in trochaics), " cla­ <lb/>
            vem mihi harunce aedium LaconicamI <lb/>
            Jam jube efferri intus ; hasce ego aedes <lb/>
            occludam foris." It is interesting to <lb/>
            observe that according to Plutarch <lb/>
            (Romulus, chap. 22) <foreign xml:lang="grc">κλειδω̑ν ὑποβολὴ</foreign> was <pb n="48"/>

              one of the three causes for which <lb/>
              Romulus allowed a husband to divorce <lb/>
              his wife. The old-fashioned locks were <lb/>
              easily picked, but with these intricate <lb/>
              steps and wards it became quite another <lb/>
              matter.</p>
          <p>422. <foreign xml:lang="grc">κρυπτά</foreign>] Fritzsche, referring to <lb/>
            Iliad xiv. 168, and Eustathius's com­ <lb/>
            mentary thereon, thinks that the key <lb/>
            itself was inclosed in a case of wood, <lb/>
            or some other material; but more <lb/>
            probably the word here means merely <lb/>
            secret, private.</p>
          <p>424. <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐκ ἦν ἀλλ</foreign>'] we had only to pick, <lb/>
            we had nothing to do but to pick. <lb/>
            I have substituted <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐκ</foreign>. for <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὖν</foreign>, which <lb/>
            did not seem to make sense.</p>
          <p>425. <foreign xml:lang="grc">δακτύλιον</foreign>] a signet-ring, in imita­ <lb/>
            tion of their husbands': <foreign xml:lang="grc">σφραγίδιον παρα­ <lb/>
            πλήσιον ᾧ ἐσφραάγιζεν ὁ ἀνήρ</foreign>.—Scholiast. <lb/>
            Athenian husbands were accustomed <lb/>
            not only to lock the storehouse door, <lb/>
            but for greater security to affix their <lb/>
            seal as well. Till now, Athenian wives <lb/>
            could laugh at these precautions. They <lb/>
            could easily open the lock, whilst they <lb/>
            could buy a seal-ring for three obols, <lb/>
            and replace the husband's broken seal <lb/>
            by an exactly similar impression. But <lb/>
            now, thanks to the teaching of Euri­ <lb/>
            pides, the husband used a complicated <lb/>
            lock and key, which defied all the <lb/>
            efforts of the wife ; and instead of the <lb/>
            old plain seal, he now wore a " worm- <lb/>
            eaten seal" which it was quite im­ <lb/>
            possible to imitate. It was thought of <lb/>
            such importance that a signet-ring <lb/>
            should not be imitated, that according <lb/>
            to Diog. Laert. (Solon 57) Solon re­ <lb/>
            quired the engraver to destroy the die <lb/>
            of every ring he sold. The ancients <lb/>
            used not sealing-wax, but a tenacious <lb/>
            clay, <foreign xml:lang="grc">γη̑ σημαντρίδα</foreign>, Hdt. ii. 38. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ῤύπους</foreign>, <lb/>
            Lysistrata 1198.</p>
          <p>427. <foreign xml:lang="grc">θριπήδεστ</foreign>'] worm-eaten. The <lb/>
            word is not employed metaphorically, <lb/>
            as might be supposed, of an intricate <lb/>
            design for a seal. There is abundance <lb/>
            of authority to show that the ancients <lb/>
            did, in reality, use pieces of worm- <lb/>
            eaten wood for their seals. Kuster <lb/>
            refers to Eustathius on Odyssey i. 150 <lb/>
            and Tzetzes on Lycophron's Cassandra <lb/>
            508, in both of which passages the fact <lb/>
            is plainly stated. See also Hesychius <lb/>

            sarily the same person as the <foreign xml:lang="grc">γραμματεὺς <lb/>
            τη̑ς βουλη̑ς</foreign> mentioned supra 374. The <lb/>
            mover of a resolution either brought <lb/>
            it ready written, or drew it up with the <lb/>
            assistance of the <foreign xml:lang="grc">γραμματεὺς</foreign> in the <lb/>
            Assembly itself. See Schömann, Do <lb/>
            Comitiis i. 11. And see the last <lb/>
            words of the oration, attributed to <lb/>
            Demosthenes, de Foedere Alexandrino. <lb/>
            In the latter alternative the mover was <lb/>

            but the Oxford Lexicographers appear <lb/>
            to be mistaken in saying that this sense <lb/>
            is confined to the Middle, since the <lb/>
            Psephism of Demophantus (as to which <lb/>
            see the note on 331 supra) commences <lb/>

            like the Chorus in Wasps 631, and <lb/>
            other Choruses elsewhere, indulge in <lb/>
            a little song of triumph on the skill <lb/>
            and eloquence of their advocate. Each <lb/>
            of the three speeches here delivered <lb/>
            is followed by a short lyric : the first <lb/>
            and third being antistrophical to each <lb/>
            other ; whilst the second, which is con­ <lb/>
            siderably the shortest of the three, is, <lb/>
            as Enger observes, a sort of <foreign xml:lang="grc">μεσῳδός</foreign>. In <lb/>
            the strophe and antistrophe the opening <lb/>
            line is spondaic, and all the rest tro­ <lb/>

            remarks of the First speaker. She is <lb/>
            not an eloquent orator like her prede­ <lb/>
            cessor ; nor does she even allude to the <lb/>
            Poet's attacks upon womankind. Her <lb/>
            grievance is like that of Demetrius the <lb/>
            silversmith in the Acts of the Apostles. <lb/>
            A poor hard-working widow, she had <lb/>
            earned a scanty livelihood for herself <lb/>
            and her children by plaiting myrtle- <lb/>
            chaplets for the worship of the Gods, <lb/>
            but Euripides, by persuading the people <lb/>

            I have inserted <foreign xml:lang="grc">μὲν</foreign>, which is omitted in <lb/>
            the MSS., probably because the following <lb/>
            word commences with <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἕτ</foreign>-. It is, how­ <lb/>
            ever, necessary to the metre, and is <lb/>
            found in the same position in both the <lb/>
            other speeches (supra 383, infra 466), <lb/>
            and indeed in very many speeches in <lb/>
            Thucydides and Xenophon. Other <lb/>

              possibly the enlightened and beneficent <lb/>
              rule of Evagoras was already beginning <lb/>
              to attract Athenians thither ; or there <lb/>
              may have been some military operations <lb/>
              there, in which the Athenians took <lb/>
              part, subsequent to the expedition of <lb/>
              Cimon about forty years before the date <lb/>
              of this Play.</p>
          <p>448. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐν ται̑ μυρρίναις</foreign> In the myrthe­ <lb/>
            market. See the note on Wasps 789. <lb/>
            She plaited her coronals in the myrtle- <lb/>
            market, because it was of myrtle that <lb/>
            she made them, <foreign xml:lang="grc">διὰ μυρρινω̑ν στεφάνους <lb/>
            ποιου̑σα</foreign>.—Scholiast. The myrtle crown <lb/>
            was prominent in divine worship, and <lb/>
            especially in the worship of Demeter <lb/>
            and Persephone. See the note on <lb/>
            Frogs 323. And indeed there was but <lb/>
            one shrine, whether in Greece or in <lb/>
            Rome, to which the myrtle was a <lb/>
            stranger. That exception was the shrine <lb/>
            of the Bona Dea, an exception so re­ <lb/>
            markable that Plutarch in the twentieth <lb/>
            of his Roman Problems" thought it <lb/>
            necessary to inquire into its origin ; <foreign xml:lang="grc">διὰ</foreign> <figure type="illustration">

              <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐκ εἰσφέρουσιν</foreign>; His own solution is <lb/>
              that the myrtle, being sacred to Aphro­ <lb/>
              dite, was unacceptable to the pure and <lb/>
              virgin goddess.</p>
          <p>449. <foreign xml:lang="grc">τέως</foreign>] Up to this time (that is, till <lb/>
            Euripides came, cf. Frogs 989) I main­ <lb/>
            tained myself (Knights 1258) though in <lb/>
            a very poor way. In the preceding line <lb/>
            it was <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἔβοσκον</foreign>, I maintained my children ; <lb/>
            here it is <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐβοσκόμην</foreign>, I maintained myself <lb/>
            and children. Teas, as Timaeus says in <lb/>
            his Platonic Lexicon, means <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἕως τινὸς</foreign>, <lb/>
            up to a certain date. See the scene in <lb/>
            the Phaedo, when Socrates drinks the <lb/>
            hemlock ; <foreign xml:lang="grc">τέως μὲν</foreign>, says the narrator, <lb/>
            " up to that time we had managed to <lb/>
            restrain our tears ; but when we saw <lb/>
            him drinking, our tears, in spite of <lb/>
            ourselves, fell down like rain."</p>

            which I have undertaken to supply, the <lb/>

            ἡ με ι̃ς ἐκδτικοὺς λέγομεν</foreign>. — Scholiast. <lb/>
            Athenaeus (xv. 26), quoting the present <lb/>
            line, says, <foreign xml:lang="grc">συνθηματι στέφασι ἠργο­ <lb/>

          <p>459. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἕτερον αὖ κ.τ.λ</foreign>.] The Chorus are <lb/>
            not in a critical mood, and they attribute <lb/>
            to the plain statement of the Second <lb/>
            Woman even more subtle-mindedness <lb/>
            and elegance than they had attributed <lb/>
            to the elaborate oration of the First. <lb/>
            With the parenthetical words <foreign xml:lang="grc">φρένας <lb/>
            ἔχουσα καὶ νόημα</foreign> cf. 291 supra.</p>
          <p>466-519. So soon as the Chorus have <lb/>
            concluded their eulogy, Mnesilochus rises <lb/>
            to address the assembly. His first words <lb/>
            may remind the reader of the politic <lb/>
            manner in which Xenophon commences <lb/>
            his speech to the irritated soldiery at <lb/>
            Byzantium ; <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὅτι μὲν ὀργίζεσθε, ὦ ἄνδρες <lb/>
            στρατιω̑ται, καὶ νομίζετε δεινὰ πάσχειν <lb/>
            ἐξαπατώμενοι,οὐ θαυμάζω</foreign>. Like Xenophon <lb/>
            too, he proceeds to argue that their <lb/>
            irritation, though not surprising, is <lb/>
            nevertheless unreasonable. For, says <lb/>
            Mnesilochus, though Euripides does <lb/>
            indeed write some unpleasant things <lb/>
            about us, yet, between ourselves, we <lb/>
            know that we deserve them all, and <lb/>
            more ; we are ever so much blacker <lb/>
            than he paints us. As the courtesan in <lb/>
            Truculentus (ii. 5) observes, <lb/>
            Cumque cam rem in cordo agito, nimio minus perhibemur <lb/>
            Malae, quam sumus ingenio.</p><pb n="53"/>

          <p>And then, with broad Plautine humour, <lb/>
            he sketches a number of scandalous <lb/>
            incidents of which Euripides had never <lb/>
            dreamed. It is a very clever and witty <lb/>
            speech, and Fritzsche can hardly find <lb/>
            words to express his admiration of it. <lb/>
            To him it is "plena facetiarum et <lb/>
            PAENE DIVIN A," and he adds, "ultima <lb/>
            narratione a v. 502 nihil melius aut in <lb/>
            suo genere praestantius ne optari quidem <lb/>
            posse."</p>
          <p>469. <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὕτως ὀναίμην τῶν τέκνων</foreign>] So may <lb/>
            I have joy of my children. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπίτηδες</foreign>, says <lb/>
            the Scholiast, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ό κηδεστὴς ὑπὲρ τὰς ἄλλας <lb/>

            In adjurations of this kind, a genitive <lb/>
            such as <foreign xml:lang="grc">τῶν τέκνων</foreign> is frequently added <lb/>
            to the simple <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὕτως ὀναίμην. ᾽Ικετεύω</foreign>, <lb/>

            common one, and I will only observe <lb/>
            that it is found, exactly as here, in the <lb/>

              in the last section of the Laches, is <lb/>
              referring to this passage, and that we <lb/>

              <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐδεὶς γὰρ ἔκφορος λόγου</foreign> (not <foreign xml:lang="grc">λόγος</foreign>).</p>

            observes, stands for <foreign xml:lang="grc">διὰ τί</foreign>. There is <lb/>
            a line in the Acharnians (<foreign xml:lang="grc">τί ταῦτα τοὺς <lb/>
            Λάκωνας αἰτιώμεθα</foreign> ; Ach. 514) so very <lb/>
            similar to this, that some have supposed <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ταῦτα</foreign> here, as there, to be governed by <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">αἰτιώμεθα</foreign>. But here <foreign xml:lang="grc">ταῦτα</foreign> seems rather <lb/>
            to be connected with <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἔχουσαι</foreign> in the <lb/>
            sense of <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὕτως ἔχουσαι</foreign>, Why being thus <lb/>
            situated (or, in other words, this being so) <lb/>
            do we blame Euripides?</p>
          <p>480. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἑπτέτιν</foreign>] For another instance of <lb/>
            a child corrupted at this early age, <lb/>
            Fritzsche refers to the story told by <lb/>
            Tzetzes (at Lycophron's Cassandra 103) <lb/>
            about Theseus and Helen. To which <lb/>
            I may add Petronius, chap. 25.</p>
          <p>482. <foreign xml:lang="grc">καταβαίνω</foreign>] It is plain that in the <lb/>
            time of Aristophanes, as in the time of <lb/>
            Homer, the <foreign xml:lang="grc">θάλαμος</foreign> or bed-chamber of <lb/>
            the master and mistress of the house, <lb/>
            was in the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὑπερῴον</foreign> or upper story. The <lb/>

          <p>500. olov y <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὑπ᾽ αὐγάς</foreign>] Many years ago <lb/>
            it occurred to me that this was the <lb/>
            easiest way of amending the unmetrical <lb/>
            reading of the MSS. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὑπ᾽ αὐγὰς οἷον</foreign>. I did <lb/>
            not think it the right way, nor do <lb/>
            I now think so ; but as Bachmann has <lb/>
            since proposed, and Velsen adopted, the <lb/>
            amendment, I give it in the text as the <lb/>
            nearest to the MS. reading, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὑπ᾽ αὐγὰς</foreign> <lb/>
            is a very familiar phrase, and many <lb/>
            examples of its use are collected by <lb/>
            Kuster and Fritzsche here and by Ruhn­ <lb/>
            ken and Hemsterhuys in their note <lb/>
            on the Lexicon of Timaeus, s.v. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὑπ᾽ <lb/>
            αὑγάς</foreign>. However the very familiarity <lb/>
            of the phrase may have led to its super­ <lb/>
            seding here what I suspect to have been <lb/>
            the true reading, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὑπαυγὲς</foreign>, the conjec­ <lb/>
            ture of Bentley. But this is a mere <lb/>
            question of language : the meaning of <lb/>
            the passage is clear. The wife stretches <lb/>
            out her new mantle for her husband to <lb/>
            admire, holding it up that the sun's <lb/>
            rays may fall upon it, whilst under- <lb/>
            Heath its screen her lover slinks secretly <lb/>
            away.</p>
          <p>502. <foreign xml:lang="grc">έτέρυν</foreign> 8' <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐγῳδ᾽</foreign>] He winds up his <lb/>
            speech with a story of the methods <lb/>
            employed by a wife for palming off <lb/>
            a supposititious child upon her too <lb/>
            credulous husband. The practice has <lb/>
            already been twice mentioned, supra <lb/>
            340, 407, and treated as something <lb/>
            more common than blameworthy, but <lb/>
            the shameless manner in which Mnesi­ <lb/>
            lochus unfolds the minutest details of <lb/>
            the transaction arouses, we shall find, <lb/>
            the most profound indignation amongst <lb/>
            his audience.</p>
          <p>504. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὠκυτόκι᾽</foreign>] These were helps, mostly <lb/>
            in the nature of amulets, employed by <lb/>
            women in travail to procure a speedy <lb/>
            and safe delivery. Theophrastus (H.P. <lb/>
            ix. 9. 3) recommends the root of the <lb/>
            cyclamen as an effective amulet for <lb/>
            this purpose. Fritzsche quotes Phry­ <lb/>

            a piece of a honeycomb was placed in <lb/>
            its mouth, which it could suck, and <lb/>
            which would prevent it crying. Inci­ <lb/>
            dents of the present kind were frequent <lb/>
            in the New Comedy, and were repro­ <lb/>
            duced by the Roman comedians. See <lb/>

              o <foreign xml:lang="grc">καλοῦμεν ἔλυτρον</foreign> (Scholiast), the mem­ <lb/>
              brane, or lining, of the womb. It is <lb/>
              difficult to determine whether these <lb/>
              words. form part of the wife's speech, <lb/>
              or are the comment of Mnesilochus <lb/>
              upon it; but on the whole I think that <lb/>
              the former is the true interpretation. <lb/>
              We have already been told that it was <lb/>
              the midwife's signal which called forth <lb/>
              the wife's exclamation: and to attri­ <lb/>
              bute it now to the babe's movement <lb/>
              would be to give another and a con­ <lb/>
              tradictory reason for its occurrence. The <lb/>
              substitution of <foreign xml:lang="grc">χύτρας</foreign> for <foreign xml:lang="grc">μήτρας</foreign> is <lb/>
              purely comic, and is no real objection <lb/>
              to putting the words into the woman's <lb/>
              month.</p>

              lina in the Winter's Tale ii. 3. <foreign xml:lang="grc">κύτ­ <lb/>
              ταρος</foreign> has many significations ; the cell <lb/>
              of a honeycomb, the cup of an acorn, <lb/>
              the early pine-cone (<foreign xml:lang="grc">τὰ τη̑ς πίτυος προαν­ <lb/>

              liasts here and on Wasps 1111, Peace <lb/>
              199. The epithet <foreign xml:lang="grc">ϭτρεβλὸν</foreign>, twisted, seems <lb/>
              to show that in this passage it signifies <lb/>
              a pine-cone.</p>
          <p>517. <foreign xml:lang="grc">νὴ τὴν Ἄρτεμιν</foreign>] Mnesilochus does <lb/>
            not forget, either here or in 569 infra, <lb/>
            to use the women's oath Lys. 435, <lb/>
            922, 949, infra 742, Eccl. 90, 136. He <lb/>
            now concludes his speech with a quota­ <lb/>
            tion (the Scholiast tells us) from the <lb/>

               </p>
          <p>520-530. This little indignant out­ <lb/>
            burst is, as we have already seen, the <lb/>
            antistrophe to the triumphant eulogy <lb/>
            with which the Chorus greeted the <lb/>
            peroration of the First Woman's speech.</p>
          <p>528. <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὴν παροιμίαν</foreign>] The proverb was <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὑπὸ παντὶ λίθῳ ϭκορπίος</foreign>, but the Chorus <lb/>
            change <foreign xml:lang="grc">ϭκορπίος</foreign> into <foreign xml:lang="grc">ῥήτωρ</foreign>, to suit the <lb/>
            occasion. Both in Athcnaeus (xv. 50, <lb/>
            Seol. 18) and in the Anthology (Scol. <lb/>
            15) we find the following scolium by <lb/>
            Praxilla of Sicyon :</p><figure type="illustration">
            <graphic url="ENG_BELL_07_fig460.jpg"/></figure>
          <p>The metre is that of the <foreign xml:lang="grc">Ἀδμήτου λόγον</foreign> <lb/>
            scolium cited in Wasps 1238, which <lb/>
            also is ascribed to Praxilla, a famous <lb/>
            scoliuin-writer, and very partial to this <lb/>
            particular metre. And Fritzsche is <lb/>
            altogether mistaken in supposing that <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὑπὸ</foreign> in the first line does not suit the <lb/>
            metre; the two syllables (technically <lb/>
            called the base) which precede the <lb/>
            choriambs may be of any quantity : <lb/>
            and many examples in which both are <lb/>
            short will be found in Gaisford's learned <pb n="59"/>

              notes to Hephaestion, chap. x. Nor <lb/>
              can I agree with Fritzsche that the <lb/>
              “ancient proverb," which is frequently <lb/>
              cited by old writers, was derived from <lb/>
              the scolium ; it was doubtless the sco­ <lb/>
              lium which was derived from the pro­ <lb/>
              verb. The proverb is one of those <lb/>
              illustrated by Erasmus, and he himself <lb/>
              employs it in one of his letters to <lb/>
              describe the alarm into which the <lb/>
              educated classes of England had been <lb/>
              thrown by the violent measures of <lb/>
              King Henry VIII. After noticing the <lb/>
              execution of Fisher and the imprison­ <lb/>
              ment of More, he proceeds “Caeteri <lb/>
              amid, qui me subinde literis et muneri­ <lb/>
              bus dignabantur, metu nec scribunt nee <lb/>
              mittunt quicquam, neque quicquam a <lb/>
              quoquam recipiunt, quasi sub omni <lb/>
              lapide dormial scorpius.” Epistle 1286, <lb/>
              Erasmi Opera, Vol. iii, p. 1509.</p>
          <p>529. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὑπὸ λίθῳ</foreign>] The notion of G. <lb/>

            stand <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸ βη̑μα τη̑ς πυκνὸς</foreign>, as in Peace <lb/>
            680 and elsewhere, though accepted by <lb/>
            Fritzsche and Enger, seems to me mani­ <lb/>
            festly wrong. The <foreign xml:lang="grc">ῥήτωρ</foreign> could not be <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὑπὸ τω̜̑ λίθῳ</foreign>, though the audience might <lb/>

          <p>532. <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐδὲν κάκιον</foreign>] They are apparently <lb/>
            quoting from the Melanippe Desmotis <lb/>

            the exception <foreign xml:lang="grc">πλὴν ἄρ᾿ εἰ γυναι̑κες</foreign> is <lb/>
            tacked on by Aristophanes himself. The <lb/>

            introduced <foreign xml:lang="grc">παρὰ προϭδοκίαν</foreign>. The Chorus <lb/>
            are casting about for some object whose <lb/>

            the first branch of the sentence, she is <lb/>

            They are mostly of very simple con­ <lb/>
            struction, not unlike our horse-scraper, <lb/>
            or the segment of a hoop from a barrel. <lb/>
            The <foreign xml:lang="grc">ϭτλεγγἰς</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">λήκυθος</foreign>, being the <lb/>
            regular concomitants of a bath, are <lb/>
            frequently mentioned together: <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐδ᾿ <lb/>

            collection) ; Plato Charmides, chap. ix. <lb/>
            (161 E); Aelian V. H. xii.29 &amp;c. These two <lb/>
            articles, when a well-to-do citizen went <lb/>
            to the baths, were carried for his use <lb/>
            by an attendant, who thence derived <lb/>
            the somewhat abnormal name of <foreign xml:lang="grc">ϭτλεγ</foreign>­ <figure type="illustration">

              adapted for scooping down grain, es­ <lb/>
              pecially grain stored away where it <lb/>
              could not be reached by the hand. And <lb/>
              that the women were addicted to little <lb/>
              pilferings of corn is more than once <lb/>
              alleged in this very Play, supra 420, <pb n="62"/>

              infra 813. And see Eccl. 15, 16 and <lb/>
              the note there. The meaning of the <lb/>
              passage, therefore, is quite clear and <lb/>
              satisfactory. Unfortunately, Kuster took <lb/>
              it into his head to propose that the <lb/>
              word we should have expected to follow <lb/>
              <foreign xml:lang="grc">ϭιφωνίζομεν</foreign>, viz. <foreign xml:lang="grc">οἶνον</foreign>, should be substi­ <lb/>
              tuted for the surprise-word <foreign xml:lang="grc">ϭι̑τον</foreign> ; and <lb/>
              this suggestion has been followed by <lb/>
              every subsequent editor. "Haec con­ <lb/>
              jectura," Fritzsche truly says, "claro <lb/>
              plausu excepta est a Reiskio, Berglero, <lb/>
              Brunckio, Bothio, Dindorfio, aliisque <lb/>
              passim" ; and he himself adds his <lb/>
              tribute of applause. But having ac­ <lb/>
              cepted and applauded it, the next thing <lb/>
              is to make sense of it. And this they <lb/>
              practically admit to be impossible. <lb/>
              Reiske thinks that <foreign xml:lang="grc">ϭτλεγγίδας</foreign> must be <lb/>
              a corruption of some other word sig­ <lb/>
              nifying a straw, "probo enim Kusteri <lb/>
              <foreign xml:lang="grc">οἶνον</foreign>" he adds, recognizing the cause <lb/>
              of the difficulty. Brunck thinks that <lb/>
              <foreign xml:lang="grc">στλεγγὶς</foreign> is not used in its ordinary <lb/>
              sense, or else that the strigil must have <lb/>
              had a tubular handle, through which <lb/>
              the wine was sucked. Fritzsche, having <lb/>
              seen the specimens in the Berlin <lb/>
              Museum, knew that this would not do, <lb/>
              and therefore suggests that the women <lb/>
              drew the wine through a tube into the <lb/>
              strigil ; which could hardly, as Enger <lb/>
              appears to see, be adduced as a proof <lb/>
              of their good sense. All this difficulty <lb/>
              is admitted to be occasioned by Kuster's <lb/>
              alteration, yet nobody has returned to <lb/>
              the MS. reading, which gives rise to no <lb/>
              difficulty at all.</p>
          <p>558. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐξ Ἀπατουρίων</foreign>] The Apaturia, <lb/>
            the great festival of the phratries, was <lb/>
            celebrated in the same month, if not <lb/>
            at the very same time, as the Thesmo­ <lb/>
            phoria. The first day was called the <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">Δόρπεια</foreign>, the Banqueting Day, because <lb/>
            in the evening of that day the members <lb/>
            of each phratria met together at a <lb/>
            great civic banquet ; <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπειδὴ φράτορες <lb/>

            at Ach. 146 ; Suidas. Doubtless some <lb/>
            Athenian women had been recently <lb/>
            detected in the act of purloining meat <lb/>
            from these banquets, for the purpose <lb/>
            (Mnesilochus insinuates) of giving it <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ται̑ς μαϭτροποι̑ς</foreign>, to their go-betweens.</p>

            Euripides does constantly mention the <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">πέλεκυς</foreign> as the weapon with which Cly­ <lb/>
            taemnestra slew her lord. Hec. 1279, <lb/>
            Troades 361, Electra 160, 279, 1160. <lb/>
            But Mnesilochus is talking not of what <lb/>
            Euripides has described, but of what he <pb n="63"/>
            <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BELL_07_fig467.jpg"/></figure> <lb/>
              has not described, <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐκ εἴρηκέ πω</foreign>, and un­ <lb/>
              doubtedly all these accusations refer to <lb/>
              some recent and well-known incidents <lb/>
              of Athenian life. And another Scholiast <lb/>
              rightly says <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐκ ἀπὸ ἱϭτορίας</foreign>, meaning <lb/>
              that there is no allusion to the old <lb/>
              Clytaemnestra story. And so in the <lb/>
              next example (a wife driving her hus­ <lb/>
              band mad with poisonous drugs) <lb/>
              (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀπὸ ἱϭτορίας παλαια̑ εἴληφεν, ἀλλ᾽ ὡς ἐν <lb/>
              τῇ Ἀττικῇ τούτου γενομένου</foreign>. And again <lb/>
              as to the Acharnian parricide, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὡς καὶ <lb/>
              τούτου πάλιν γενομένου</foreign>. The Acharnian <lb/>
              woman had murdered her father, and <lb/>
              buried his body under the bath. In <lb/>
              the Wife of Bath's prologue 6347-54, <lb/>
              Chaucer gives a list of female crimes <lb/>
              very similar to that of Mnesilochus <lb/>
              here.</p>
          <p>564. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὡς ϭύ</foreign>] After enumerating the <lb/>
            various crimes committed by Athenian <lb/>
            women, he suddenly turns upon his <lb/>
            antagonist herself, and charges her with <lb/>
            exchanging her baby-girl with her maid­ <lb/>
            servant's baby-boy. This personal attack <lb/>
            is too much for the other's patience ; <lb/>
            and a personal brawl ensues which <lb/>
            might well have broken up the assembly <lb/>
            altogether, but for the unexpected <lb/>
            diversion occasioned by the appearance <lb/>
            of Cleisthenes.</p>
          <p>567. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐκποκιῶ</foreign>] I'll pull your wool out : <lb/>
            I'll comb your coxcomb for you.</p>
          <p>568. <foreign xml:lang="grc">καὶ μὴν ἰδού</foreign>] With these words <lb/>
            she throws herself into a fighting atti­ <lb/>
            tude. Mnesilochus, nothing loth, follows <lb/>
            her example. Thereupon she flings her <lb/>
            upper garment to a friend, in prepara­ <lb/>
            tion for the combat. Compare the <lb/>
            well-known words of Hippouax, <foreign xml:lang="grc">λάβετέ <lb/>
            μου θοἰμάτιον, κόψω Βουπάλου τὸν ὀφθαλ­ <lb/>
            μόν</foreign> : and see the note on Wasps 408.</p>
          <p>569. <foreign xml:lang="grc">πρόϭθες μόνον</foreign>] Only lay a hand on <lb/>
            me. In the following line he insinuates <lb/>
            that, notwithstanding it is the <foreign xml:lang="grc">Νηϭτεία</foreign>, <lb/>
            the woman has been indulging in a feast <lb/>
            of sesamé-cake, a favourite dainty with <lb/>
            Athenian women, and the recognized <lb/>
            wedding-cake at Athens. See Peace 869, <lb/>
            and the note on Peace 862.</p>
          <p>571. <foreign xml:lang="grc">γυνή τις</foreign>] A feminine figure is <lb/>
            seen approaching, which the Chorus <lb/>
            naturally suppose to be a woman, but <lb/>
            which turns out to be the notorious <lb/>
            Cleisthenes, to whom Mnesilochus, when <lb/>
            his face had been shaven into the <lb/>
            similitude of a woman's, has already <lb/>
            compared himself (supra 235), and who <lb/>
            in almost every Comedy of Aristophanes, <lb/>
            from the Acharnians to the Frogs, is <lb/>
            satirized for the degrading effeminacy of <lb/>
            his manners and habits. So thoroughly <pb n="64"/>
            <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BELL_07_fig468.jpg"/></figure> <lb/>
              is he identified with the womankind, <lb/>
              that the Chorus express no indignation <lb/>
              at his appearance amongst them ; though <lb/>
              indeed his first speech contains a sort of <lb/>
              apologetic excuse for his intrusion.</p>

            his face is as devoid of hair as a woman's, <lb/>
            cf. infra 583 He is woman-mad, <foreign xml:lang="grc">γυναικο­ <lb/>

            declares himself to be bird-mad, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὀρνιθο­ <lb/>
            μανῶ</foreign>. He is their <foreign xml:lang="grc">πρόξενος</foreign>, because, if <lb/>
            any question arises about them among <lb/>
            the men, he makes it his business to <lb/>

              <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἡ "Ανοδος</foreign>, the Ascent. The Scholiast <lb/>
              says, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀναπέμψαι κυρίως, διὸ καὶ Ανοδος ἡ <lb/>
              πρώτη λέγεται, παρ' ἐνίοις καὶ Κάθοδος διὰ <lb/>

              623, 1045. The words Trap' <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐνίοις καὶ <lb/>
              Κάθοδος</foreign> embody, of course, the ordinary <lb/>
              confusion between the first and second <lb/>
              days of the Festival. <foreign xml:lang="grc">῎Ανοδος</foreign> means the <lb/>
              Ascent of the women to the temple ; <lb/>
              <foreign xml:lang="grc">Κάθοδος</foreign>, the Descent of Persephone to <lb/>
              the world below. See the Introduction. <lb/>
              The feelings of Mnesilochus during the <lb/>
              ensuing dialogue may be more easily <lb/>
              imagined than described. The next <lb/>
              question of the Chorus, as Fritzsche <lb/>
              remarks, "spirat tragoediam.”</p>
          <p>593. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἠλίθιος</foreign>] Mnesilochus speaks with <lb/>
            a keen recollection of the tortures he <lb/>
            endured during the process which Clei­ <lb/>
            sthenes is describing.</p>
          <p>603. <foreign xml:lang="grc">πρώτη σύ</foreign>] It is probable that he <lb/>
            is addressing the First Woman ; and <lb/>
            the <foreign xml:lang="grc">παιδίον</foreign>, the dummy child which her <lb/>
            nurse is carrying, is doubtless, as <lb/>
            Fritzsche suggests, the wine-flask dressed <lb/>
            up in baby clothes which at line 690 <lb/>
            Mnesilochus snatches from its (supposed) <lb/>
            mother's arms. See the note on 383 <lb/>
            supra.</p>
          <p>605. <foreign xml:lang="grc">Κλεωνύμουγυνή</foreign>] If this is the <lb/>
            Cleonymus so often mentioned in the <lb/>
            earlier Plays, this is his last appearance <note type="footnote"> F </note> <pb n="66"/>

              in the Comedies of Aristophanes. In <lb/>
              the Acharnians and Knights lie is <lb/>
              satirized merely for his gross bulk and <lb/>
              enormous voracity ; but thenceforward <lb/>
              he is known as the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ῥίψασπις</foreign>, the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀσπιδ­ <lb/>
              αποβλής</foreign>. We may be sure that this act <lb/>
              of " discretion " occurred at the battle <lb/>
              of Delium, where there was a great <lb/>
              casting-away of Athenian shields. <lb/>
              Fritzsche thinks it an intentional stroke <lb/>
              of humour that the wife of <foreign xml:lang="grc">Κλεωνύμη</foreign> <lb/>
              (Clouds 680) should be the first suspected <lb/>
              of being a man.</p>

          <p>616. <foreign xml:lang="grc">στραγγουριῶ</foreign>] He excuses his delay <lb/>
            by alleging that he is afflicted with <lb/>
            strangury, that is, to adopt Forcellini's <lb/>
            definition, " urinae stillicidium, cum <lb/>

            not only their merchant vessels, but <lb/>
            also, on occasion, their triremes, with <lb/>
            great rapidity, from one sea to the <lb/>
            other. The ships were hauled on trolleys <lb/>
            (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ὁλκοὺς</foreign>, Thuc. iii. 15) along a beaten <lb/>
            track, which was from this custom <lb/>

            The term <foreign xml:lang="grc">πυκνότερον</foreign> forbids us to restrict <lb/>
            the speaker's meaning to the compara­ <lb/>
            tively infrequent transit of ships of <lb/>
            war, though several instances of this <lb/>
            transit are recorded by historians ; and <lb/>
            though the present allusion is probably <lb/>
            due to the circumstance that, less than <lb/>
            two years previously, the Corinthians <lb/>
            had, in fact, unobserved by the Athenians, <lb/>
            transported in this manner a consider­ <lb/>
            able part of their navy from the gulf of <lb/>
            Corinth to the Saronic gulf. Their <lb/>
            navy had been operating in the former <lb/>
            gulf against the Athenian squadron <lb/>
            stationed at Naupactus ; but at the <lb/>
            commencement of the summer season <lb/>
            of B.C. 412, Thucydides tells us, the <lb/>
            Spartans, planning an expedition to <lb/>
            Chios, arranged that the Corinthians <figure type="illustration">

              <lb/>
              <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸν 'Ισθμὸν</foreign>, should dispatch them at <lb/>
              once to Chios. Accordingly the Corinth­ <lb/>
              ians conveyed twenty-one ships across <lb/>
              the isthmus without the Athenians <pb n="69"/>

              knowing anything of the matter. But <lb/>
              shortly afterwards the Athenians at­ <lb/>
              tended the Isthmian games, which were <lb/>
              celebrated not far from the <foreign xml:lang="grc">Διολκὸς</foreign>, and <lb/>
              so discovered what was going on. Thuc. <lb/>

          <p>654. <foreign xml:lang="grc">το</foreign>ȋ<foreign xml:lang="grc">ς πρυτάνεσιν</foreign>] It was the duty <lb/>
            of the Prytanes to keep order at the <lb/>
            meetings of the Ecclesia and the Council, <lb/>
            employing for this purpose the Scythian <lb/>
            archers who formed the police-force at <lb/>
            Athens. See Ach. 54-7, Knights 665, <lb/>
            Plato, Protagoras, chap. x. (319 c), and <lb/>
            the notes on Eccl. 87 and 143. In the <lb/>
            present case Mnesilochus had been occa­ <lb/>
            sioning a disturbance in the Women's <lb/>
            Ecclesia, convened by the order of their <lb/>
            Council (supra 373-6) ; and in punishing <lb/>
            the offender, the Prytanes are acting as <lb/>
            the officers of the Council, infra 943. <lb/>
            This means, no doubt, the Council of <lb/>
            the Five Hundred, which, insensibly, <lb/>
            takes the place of the <foreign xml:lang="grc">βουλὴ τῶν γυναικῶν</foreign>.</p>
          <p>655. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἡμᾶς τοίνυν</foreign>] One Man has been <lb/>
            discovered in the sacred precincts, and <lb/>
            the Chorus now propose to make a <lb/>
            minute and thorough search, for the <lb/>
            purpose of ascertaining whether any <lb/>
            others of that hostile sex are lurking <lb/>
            about where no men should be. In the <lb/>
            ensuing Choral song they profess to be <lb/>
            moving in and out through the place <lb/>
            where the Assembly has just been held, <lb/>
            peeping and peering in every direction ; <lb/>
            and they wind up by saying that they <lb/>
            have searched in every quarter, and <lb/>
            have satisfied themselves that no other <lb/>
            Man is there. But all this is a mere <lb/>
            make-believe ; they never really leave <lb/>
            the orchestra at all. Just as in the <lb/>
            Frogs, the Mystic Chorus, without <lb/>
            stirring from their station, represent <lb/>
            by their gestures and evolutions the <lb/>
            successive stages of the Eleusinian pro­ <lb/>
            cession ; so here the Chorus of Women, <lb/>
            by their gestures and evolutions in the <lb/>
            orchestra, represent the various steps of <lb/>
            the vigilant and exhaustive investigation <lb/>
            which they profess to be carrying out <lb/>
            elsewhere. The words <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὰς λαμπάδας <lb/>
            ἁψαμένας</foreign> point to another, though a <lb/>
            very slight, resemblance between the <pb n="70"/>

              two Choruses. Both enter with lighted <lb/>
              torches; both extinguish them, and <lb/>
              afterwards relight them. See supra 280, <lb/>
              and the notes on Frogs 323, 454, and <lb/>
              1524.</p>

            dance more freely.</p>
          <p>658. <foreign xml:lang="grc">πύκνα</foreign>] They speak of the place <lb/>
            where the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐκκλησία</foreign>rav <foreign xml:lang="grc">γυναιλω̑ν</foreign> has just <lb/>
            been held in terms more strictly appro­ <lb/>
            priate to the meeting-place of the real <lb/>
            Athenian <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐκκλησίσ</foreign>. By <foreign xml:lang="grc">διόδους</foreign> they <lb/>
            mean the passages or aisles which <lb/>
            traversed the real Pnyx, to enable the <lb/>
            citizens to reach their seats, or to go up <lb/>
            to the bema without any disorder. <lb/>
            There were tents in the Agora ; indeed <lb/>
            at one time the Scythian archers dwelt <lb/>
            in tents in the midst of the Agora.— <lb/>
            Scholiast on Ach. 54. But there is <lb/>
            doubtless also an allusion here to the <lb/>
            tents erected in the precincts of the <lb/>
            Thesmophorium. See supra 624.</p>
          <p>6G2. <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὴν πρώτη</foreign>] First of all. This <lb/>
            adverbial expression, though not so <lb/>
            common as the analogous <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὴν ταχιστην</foreign> <lb/>
            (Wasps 990), is yet very frequently found. <lb/>
            See Hdt. i. 153 and iii. 134 ; Xen. Mem. <lb/>
            iii. 6. 10 ; Demosthenes, Third Olynthiac <lb/>
            § 2 ; Lucian's Piscator § 39. It is a <lb/>
            special favourite with Heliodorus, who <lb/>
            constantly employs it in his Aethiopics : <lb/>
            i. 10. 26 ; iii. 13. 18; v. 22. 27 ; vii. 18.27. <lb/>
            The meaning is not quite identical in all <lb/>
            the passages cited ; and it would be im­ <lb/>
            possible to supply always the same sub­ <lb/>
            stantive <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὢραν, ὀδὸν</foreign>, or the like. In addi­ <lb/>
            tion to'the simple accusative <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὴν πρώτην</foreign>, <lb/>
            we find also <foreign xml:lang="grc">παρὰ τὴν πρώτην, κατὰ τὴν <lb/>
            πρὠτην</foreign>, and <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀπὀ πη̑ς πρώτης</foreign> used in a <lb/>
            similar sense. <foreign xml:lang="grc">χρη̑ν</foreign> in this line is Bent­ <lb/>
            ley's correction of the MS. <foreign xml:lang="grc">χρή</foreign>- If we <lb/>
            adopt Porson's <foreign xml:lang="grc">χρή σ</foreign>', we must, I pre­ <lb/>
            sume, consider the Coryphaeus to be <lb/>
            directing some one member of the <lb/>
            Chorus to lead the way in the circling <lb/>
            dance. In this case, of course, <foreign xml:lang="grc">την <lb/>
            πρώτην</foreign> would lose its quasi-adverbial <lb/>
            signification.</p>
          <p>663. <foreign xml:lang="grc">μάτενε πάντ</foreign>'[<foreign xml:lang="grc">ε'ρρωμένως</foreign>]] The <lb/>
            MSS. have <foreign xml:lang="grc">μάτευε ταχὺπάντ</foreign>' but the line <lb/>
            should be a trochaic tetrameter cata­ <pb n="71"/>
            <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BELL_07_fig478.jpg"/></figure> <lb/>
              lectic; and I have omitted <foreign xml:lang="grc">ταχὺ</foreign> and <lb/>
              inserted <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐρρωμέως</foreign>, not as being the <lb/>
              word written by Aristophanes, but as <lb/>
              carrying on the metrical swing.</p>
          <p>667-686. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἢν γαρ ... ἀποτίνεται</foreign>] This <lb/>
            system, as Hermann first pointed out, is <lb/>
            undoubtedly intended to correspond to <lb/>
            that contained in lines 707-725 infra <lb/>
            (rt <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἂ</foreign>v <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὖν... τύχη</foreign>), although one is a <lb/>
            pure Choral song, and the other a dia­ <lb/>
            logue between the Chorus and Mnesi­ <lb/>
            lochus. But each system has become so <lb/>
            muddled that it is impossible now, espe­ <lb/>
            cially in the later lines, to bring them <lb/>
            into complete harmony. And I am not <lb/>
            sure that critics have not, in some cases, <lb/>
            altered the true reading in one system <lb/>
            for the purpose of making it correspond <lb/>
            to the corrupt reading in the other. In <lb/>
            the first line, however, it is clear that <lb/>
            the error is in the strophe, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἢν γὰρ μὴ <lb/>
            λάθῃ</foreign> which gives a good sense (if a man <lb/>
            shall be detected in this sacrilegious act), <lb/>
            but does not suit the metre. For the line, <lb/>
            both here and in 707 infra, is plainly an <lb/>
            anapaestic dimeter ; the long syllable of <lb/>
            the concluding anapaest being, in each <lb/>
            case, resolved into two short syllables, so <lb/>
            forming a proceleusmatic foot, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀνσια</foreign> <lb/>
            here, -<foreign xml:lang="grc">τά τις ὂτε</foreign> there. Fritzsche first <lb/>
            changed <foreign xml:lang="grc">μὴ</foreign>) into ne, as the joint conjec­ <lb/>
            ture of himself, Bergk, and an unnamed <lb/>
            scholar ; and this alteration has been <lb/>
            generally followed. Nobody has vouch­ <lb/>
            safed to explain this reading, which does <lb/>
            not seem altogether satisfactory, and <lb/>
            certainly stands in need of some expla­ <lb/>
            nation. I take it to mean If we shall dis­ <lb/>
            cover any man icho, unperceived by me, <lb/>
            has perpetrated this sacrilegious act ; <lb/>
            though it may also mean If we fail to <lb/>
            detect him, yet the Gods icill not leave him <lb/>
            unpunished. The first meaning is more <lb/>
            suitable to the context; the second gives <lb/>
            the natural signification to <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἢν λάθῃ</foreign>. <lb/>
            Each of these little lyrical systems is <lb/>
            preceded by a few trochaic tetrameters.</p>
          <p>671. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀθέων τε τρόπων</foreign>.]That some words <lb/>
            have dropped out here is shown both by <lb/>
            the sense, and by the metre. The in­ <lb/>

            "godless doings," but of the punish­ <lb/>

            this point the antistrophical traces are <lb/>
            very dimly perceivable. It seems certain <lb/>
            that the strophe has been more depraved <lb/>
            than the antistrophe. The verbiage <lb/>
            which follows bears no resemblance to <lb/>
            the usual style of Aristophanes, whose <lb/>
            language and metres, like the thoughts <lb/>
            they embody, are always very crisp and <lb/>
            clear. " He shall show to all mankind <lb/>
            that they should reverence the Gods, and <lb/>
            following after what is holy, and study­ <lb/>
            ing what is lawful, should do the thing <lb/>
            that is right." <figure type="illustration">

            <foreign xml:lang="grc">παραχρη̑μα</foreign> is emphatic. The punishment <lb/>

              nutive of <foreign xml:lang="grc">μηρίων</foreign> But, of course, it must <lb/>
              not be supposed that there were really <lb/>
              any pieces cut from the victim's <lb/>
              thighs" or any sacrificial knife (not­ <lb/>
              withstanding the words <foreign xml:lang="grc">μαχαίρᾳ. τῃδε</foreign>) on <lb/>
              the altar of the Twain Goddesses. Mnesi­ <lb/>
              lochus speaks in a high tragic vein, and <lb/>
              is probably adopting the very words, if <lb/>
              not of the Telephus, of some other <lb/>
              tragic play. Indeed, throughout the <lb/>
              scene the language is the language of <lb/>
              tragedy. The incident, though analo­ <lb/>
              gous to that in the Acharnians (326 <lb/>
              seqq.), differs widely in its details.</p><pb n="74"/>
              <figure type="illustration">

          <p>697. <foreign xml:lang="grc">τροπι̑ον</foreign>] We are still on tragic <lb/>
            ground, and the language employed is <lb/>
            not exactly appropriate to the matter <lb/>
            in hand. The expressions <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἰστάναι βοὴν</foreign>, <lb/>
            to raise a war-cry, and <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἰστάαιτροι̑ον</foreign> to <lb/>
            erect a trophy, are very familiar, and here <lb/>
            constitute a call to arms, to defeat the <lb/>
            aggressive manœuvre of Mnesilochus. <lb/>
            Some, indeed, take <foreign xml:lang="grc">τροπαι̑ον</foreign> as an ad­ <lb/>
            jective, connected with <foreign xml:lang="grc">βοὴν</foreign>, a war-cry <lb/>
            which may turn our enemy to flight. But <lb/>
            this can hardly be the true meaning. <lb/>
            And, in fact, Mnesilochus has already <lb/>
            taken flight, and the object of the woman <lb/>
            (supra 689) is to stay him.</p>
          <p>704. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐξαράξει</foreign>] The MSS. and early <lb/>
            editions read <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐξάρξω</foreign>, without sense or <lb/>
            metre. Bentley suggested either <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐξα­ <lb/>
            ράξω</foreign> or <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐξαράξει</foreign>; and one or other of <lb/>
            these conjectures is adopted by Brunck <lb/>
            and all subsequent editors. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐξαράξει</foreign> <lb/>
            seems to me indubitably right. The olov <lb/>
            with which the line commences must <lb/>
            necessarily carry on the idea of the <lb/>
            double olov of the preceding line, olov <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">δέδρακενἒργον</foreign>; olov <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐξαράξει</foreign> k.T. A. Those <lb/>
            who read <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐξαράξω</foreign>translate it, with <lb/>
            Reiske, 0 quam pulchre vobis nimiam <lb/>
            restrain audaciam excutiam, which en­ <lb/>
            tirely ignores the sense in which <foreign xml:lang="grc">οἶον</foreign> <lb/>

            name of the second day of the Anthe­ <lb/>
            steria, and this is one of the many <lb/>
            passages which seem to show (contrary <lb/>
            to Boeckh's contention) that the Anthe­ <lb/>
            steria and the Lenaea were two names <lb/>
            for one and the same festival. For the <lb/>
            age of the wine would surely be measured <lb/>
            from the date of the Lenaea when the <lb/>
            wine was made ; just as Theocritus <lb/>
            (xiv. 16) speaks of wine <foreign xml:lang="grc">τετόρων ἐτέων <lb/>

              to the preceding question. Ita fere est; <lb/>
              you are not far wrong. It is three or <lb/>
              four years old (she does not distinguish <lb/>
              between these two figures) plus the time <lb/>
              which has elapsed since the last Dionysia, <lb/>

              The Thesmophoria were celebrated some <lb/>
              eight months after the Anthesteria. This <lb/>
              seems to have been a very fine bottle for <lb/>
              its years ; not like the diminutive flask <lb/>
              of wine which an admirer gave to <lb/>
              Phryne. Tt's ten years old, lie said ; It's <lb/>
              mighty little for its age, said Phryne. <lb/>
              Athenaeus xiii. 49. The same repartee <lb/>
              is attributed (Ath. xiii. 47) to Gnathaena <lb/>
              who, like other noted wits, obtained <lb/>
              credit not only for her own smart say­ <lb/>
              ings, but for many others of a similar <lb/>
              character. And a kindred witticism is <lb/>
              recorded of Cicero (Macrobius, Sat. ii. 3) <lb/>
              who, when his host was pressing upon him <lb/>
              some very moderate wine as Falernian <lb/>
              forty years old, observed, It bears its <lb/>
              years remarkably well (beneacetatem fert): <lb/>
              meaning that no one would suspect it <lb/>
              of being so old.</p>
          <p>748. <foreign xml:lang="grc">μὰ τὸν Ἀπόλλω τουτογί</foreign>] Not it, by <lb/>
            Apollo. The reading of the MSS. and <lb/>
            editions is <foreign xml:lang="grc">μὰ τὸν Ἀπόλλω τουτονὸ</foreign>, which <lb/>
            the Latin translators, Andrea Diva and <lb/>
            Kuster, took in a similar sense, whilst <lb/>
            Bothe explained <foreign xml:lang="grc">τουτονὶ</foreign> by <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸν ἀσκόν</foreign>. <lb/>
            But Brunck, in revising Kuster's trans­ <lb/>
            lation, saw that the words must mean <lb/>
            No, by Apollo here, and Fritzsche, after <lb/>
            suggesting <foreign xml:lang="grc">τουτογὶ</foreign>, was content to be­ <lb/>
            lieve that Mnesilochus is addressing the <lb/>
            statue of Apollo <foreign xml:lang="grc">Ἀγυιεὺς</foreign>, of which Pollux <lb/>
            (iv. segm. 123) says, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπὶ τῆς σκηνῆς καὶ <lb/>
            Ἀγυιεὺς ἔκειτο βωμὸς πρὸ τῶν θυρῶν</foreign>. But <lb/>
            the language of Pollux, <foreign xml:lang="grc">πρὸ τῶν θυρῶν</foreign>, <lb/>
            shows that he is speaking only of scenes <lb/>
            which represented the exterior of a <lb/>
            house, and in such cases the <foreign xml:lang="grc">προθύρου <lb/>
            προπύλαιος</foreign> would naturally be stationed <lb/>
            before the door. Such was the case, as <lb/>
            we know, in the Wasps (see the note on <lb/>
            Wasps 875) ; and such was also the case <lb/>
            in the line of Menander which Fritzsche <lb/>
            cites from Suidas (s. vv. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ναὶ μὰ</foreign> TO) <foreign xml:lang="grc">μαρτύ­ <lb/>

            as the last words plainly show. And <lb/>
            here too, so long as the scene repre­ <lb/>
            sented the outside of Agathon's house, <lb/>
            there would doubtless be an <foreign xml:lang="grc">Ἀγυιεὺς</foreign> at <lb/>
            the door. But now that the scene has <lb/>
            changed, and we are within the precincts <lb/>
            of the Thesmophorium, there could be <lb/>
            no <foreign xml:lang="grc">Ἀγυιεὺς</foreign> for Mnesilochus to adjure. <pb n="79"/>

              And though the old translators gave <lb/>
              <foreign xml:lang="grc">τουτονὶ</foreign> a meaning which it could not <lb/>
              bear, I think that they were guided by <lb/>
              a sound Aristophanic instinct, and that <lb/>
              their meaning must be obtained by <lb/>
              reading <foreign xml:lang="grc">μὰ τὸν Ἀπόλλω τουτογί</foreign>. There <lb/>
              is a similar confusion between <foreign xml:lang="grc">τουτονί</foreign> <lb/>
              and <foreign xml:lang="grc">τουτογὶ</foreign> infra 880.</p>

            <foreign xml:lang="grc">πεϱισπᾶται ἡ δευτέρα συλλαβὴ</foreign>, there seems <lb/>
            no doubt that both forms, <foreign xml:lang="grc">σφάγιον</foreign> and <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">σφαγεῖον</foreign>, were, as Fritzsche contends, <lb/>
            employed to denote the sacrificial bowl. <lb/>
            Pollux, as he observes, uses the two <lb/>
            forms indiscriminately, Book x. segmm. <lb/>
            65 and 97, and Hesychius spells the <lb/>
            word <foreign xml:lang="grc">σφάγιον</foreign> ; whilst Fritzsche's own <lb/>
            emendation of Iph. in Taur. 335, <foreign xml:lang="grc">πρὸς <lb/>
            χέρνιβας καὶ σφάγιον ἐξέπεμπέ σοι</foreign>, seems <lb/>
            at least as probable as Musgrave's <foreign xml:lang="grc">πρὸς <lb/>
            χέρνιβάς τε καὶ σφαγεί᾽ ἔπεμπέ σοι</foreign>. On <lb/>
            the other hand <foreign xml:lang="grc">σφαγεῖον</foreign> is probably the <lb/>
            more common form. But here neither <lb/>
            the <foreign xml:lang="grc">μοι</foreign> nor the <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸ</foreign> can be spared.</p>
          <p>756. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὕπεχ᾽ αὐτό</foreign>] Mnesilochus, prepar­ <lb/>
            ing to drain the contents of the wine- <lb/>
            skin, still speaks of it as a victim which <lb/>
            he is about to sacrifice. Compare Lysi­ <lb/>
            strata 202. The Woman therefore calls <lb/>
            for the sacrificial bowl, which was held <lb/>
            underneath by the priest to catch the <lb/>
            blood of the victim, her object being to <lb/>
            get for herself a few drops of the precious <lb/>
            liquid contained in the wine-skin. He <lb/>
            does not object to her performing this <lb/>
            part of the priest's duty, especially as <lb/>
            he intends that every drop of the wine <lb/>
            shall go down his own throat, and none <lb/>
            shall fall into the bowl beneath. To the <lb/>
            Woman's disgust therefore she receives <lb/>
            for her perquisite as priestess, not a <lb/>
            drop of wine, but merely the empty <lb/>
            wine-skin, the entire contents of which <lb/>
            Mnesilochus has drained.</p>

            she herself informs us, infra 898, is <lb/>
            Critylla : and she remains on the stage <lb/>
            till all the actors go out before the great <lb/>

          <p>763. <foreign xml:lang="grc">λαβοῦσα Κλεισθένην</foreign>] Cleisthenes <lb/>
            has already gone, supra 654, to tell the <lb/>
            Prytanes what has occurred. Mica will <lb/>
            now go herself to invoke their aid, over­ <lb/>
            taking Cleisthenes, and bringing him <lb/>
            with her, as the recognized Women's <lb/>
            Advocate. Having thus adroitly shifted <lb/>
            to Critylla's shoulders the duty of keep­ <lb/>
            ing guard on Mnesilochus, she at once <lb/>
            leaves the stage, and Mnesilochus com­ <lb/>
            mences a soliloquy on his own alarming <lb/>
            situation. Observe that in 767 it is <lb/>
            Euripides who has involved him in this <lb/>
            scrape : in 651 supra, it was he himself ; <lb/>
            but of course both statements are true.</p>
          <p>770. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐκ τοῦ Παλαμήδους</foreign>] the Palamede <lb/>
            of Euripides is said to have been ex­ <lb/>
            hibited in the early spring of B. c. 415, <lb/>
            together with the Alexander, the still <lb/>
            extant Troades, and a satyric drama <lb/>
            called the Sisyphus.—Aelian V. H. ii. 8. <lb/>
            Palamede was put to death by the <lb/>
            Achaeans in Troyland, on a false charge <lb/>
            of treachery; and his brother Oeax, <lb/>
            wishing to send intelligence of his fate <lb/>
            to their father Nauplius in Euboea, hit <lb/>
            upon the device of writing it upon oar- <lb/>
            blades, and launching the oar-blades <lb/>
            into the Aegean sea. Mnesilochus do­ <pb n="81"/>

              venture to Euripides in a similar way, <lb/>
              but the difficulty is that he has got no <lb/>
              oar-blades. However, he soon thinks of <lb/>
              a substitute. Massinger, in the Great <lb/>

              write his sad story with a diamond ring <lb/>

          <p>776. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὦ χεῖρες ἐμαί</foreign>] It is impossible to <lb/>
            say how much of this little anapaestic <lb/>
            system is borrowed, or parodied, from <lb/>
            Euripides, and how much of it is purely <lb/>
            Aristophanic. We cannot suppose that, <lb/>
            in the Tragedy, Oeax was represented on <lb/>
            the stage in the act of launching his <lb/>
            oar-blades on the waves. The deed must <lb/>
            have been narrated in the speech of <lb/>
            some Messenger, or described in some <lb/>
            choral song. Fritzsche gives to Euripides <lb/>
            lines 778-780 (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἄγε δὴ</foreign>—<foreign xml:lang="grc">μόχθων</foreign>), and 783 <lb/>

            Doricisms <foreign xml:lang="grc">κείνᾳ ταύτᾳ</foreign> in the last line <lb/>
            Poison compares Eurip. Hec. 163 <foreign xml:lang="grc">ποίαν, <lb/>
            ἢ ταύταν ἢ κείναν, στείχω</foreign> ; Probably the <lb/>
            first three words, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὦ χεῖρες ἐμαὶ</foreign>, are also <lb/>
            Euripidean, and are to be considered as <lb/>
            standing apart, so that Aristophanes felt <lb/>
            himself justified in commencing the <lb/>
            next line with a vowel. On the other <lb/>
            hand, Euripides could have had nothing <lb/>
            to do with the play on words which, as <lb/>
            Fritzsche observes, runs through the <lb/>

              <foreign xml:lang="grc">χώρει</foreign> would not mean veni ; and Enger <lb/>

              cutting his message on the wood. Move <lb/>
              on, move on, he says, as he carefully <lb/>
              guides the instrument over the surface ; <lb/>
              but presently it makes too deep or too <lb/>
              prolonged a cut, and he can only exclaim <lb/>
              <foreign xml:lang="grc">ποίαν αὔλακα</foreign> (subaud. <foreign xml:lang="grc">χωρε</foreign>î) ; There's a <lb/>

              he flings the tablets hither and thither <lb/>

            the last Parabasis proper which Aristo­ <lb/>
            phanes ever wrote, at all events the latest <lb/>
            which has survived. The introductory <lb/>
            line is, or does duty for, the Commation. <lb/>
            In general, before the Parabasis com­ <lb/>
            mences, all the actors are withdrawn <lb/>
            from the stage, and when it concludes, <lb/>
            we are confronted with an entirely new <lb/>
            scene. Here however Mnesilochus is, <lb/>
            apparently, unable to leave, and Cri­ <lb/>
            tylla remains to guard him ; and conse­ <lb/>
            quently the Parabasis marks no change <lb/>
            in the position of the actors ; and when <lb/>
            it is over, the thread is taken up un­ <lb/>
            broken.</p>

              catena of similar libels on womankind <lb/>
              from the poets who flourished both <lb/>
              before and after the time of Susarion. <lb/>

              at the speech of Hippolytus (Eur. Hipp. <lb/>

            well known. The <foreign xml:lang="grc">αὔλειος θύρα</foreign>, or outer <lb/>

            <foreign xml:lang="grc">μέσαυλος</foreign>, or inner door, the limit for the <lb/>

            suggests, in some festal ceremony, infra <lb/>

            θεᾶσθαι</foreign> is due to the late Bishop Kaye, <lb/>
            a very excellent scholar. On Porson's <lb/>
            death, it was doubtful whether Monk <lb/>

            or Dobree, would be selected to fill the <lb/>
            vacant chair. Monk was chosen, and <lb/>
            Kaye was made Regius Professor of <lb/>
            Divinity and afterwards became Bishop <lb/>
            of Lincoln. His name was a puzzle to <lb/>
            Fritzsche, who says ”Dobraeus breviter, <lb/>

            forward for comparison five female <lb/>
            names, Nausimache, Salabaccho, Aristo­ <lb/>
            mache, Stratonice, and Eubule. Sala­ <lb/>
            baccho, we know, was a bold and vulgar <lb/>
            courtezan, but, notwithstanding the <lb/>
            guesses of the Scholiast, there is no <lb/>
            reason for placing any of the others in <lb/>
            the same category. They stand on quite <lb/>
            a different footing. It is for her character, <lb/>
            not for her name, that she is intro­ <lb/>
            duced ; the others are selected solely for <lb/>
            their names, and possibly are not in­ <lb/>
            tended to represent any particular indi­ <lb/>
            viduals.</p>
          <p>The name Nausimache signifies a <lb/>
            Naval engagement ; and Charminus, a <lb/>
            well-known Athenian officer of the day, <lb/>
            is said to be unequal to Nausimache, <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">Ναυσιμάχηςἥττων</foreign>, in reference to his <lb/>
            defeat, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἧτταν</foreign>, in a naval engagement <lb/>
            which occurred off the little island of <lb/>
            Syme about a year before the exhibition <lb/>
            of this Play. He was stationed there <lb/>
            with a squadron of twenty Athenian <lb/>
            ships, to intercept some Peloponnesian <lb/>
            reinforcements, sailing northward ; <lb/>
            when the entire Peloponnesian fleet, <lb/>
            moving southward from Miletus, sud­ <lb/>
            denly resolved to swoop down upon <lb/>
            Syme, and attempt to surprise him <lb/>
            there. They arrived unseen at the <lb/>
            other side of the islet, but in the night, <lb/>
            which was wet and dark, some ships <lb/>
            became detached from the main body, <lb/>
            and at daybreak were fully visible to <lb/>
            Charminus. Thinking them to be the <lb/>
            reinforcements for which he was lying <lb/>
            in wait, he immediately attacked them <lb/>
            with vigour and success ; when suddenly <lb/>
            the whole Peloponnesian fleet came <lb/>
            swinging round the corner of the island, <lb/>
            and began to close him in on every <lb/>
            side ; so that he was glad to escape with <lb/>
            the loss of six Athenian vessels: Thuc. <lb/>
            viii. 41, 42. It was plain therefore, <lb/>
            from what actually happened (<foreign xml:lang="grc">δῆλα δὲ <lb/>
            τἄργα</foreign>), say the Chorus, that Charminus <lb/>
            was not equal to Nausimache.</p>
          <p>805. <foreign xml:lang="grc">Σαλαβακχοῦς</foreign>] This is not the first <lb/>
            time that this notorious <foreign xml:lang="grc">πόρνη</foreign> has been <lb/>
            compared with, and pronounced supe­ <lb/>
            rior to, a violent and unprincipled <lb/>
            demagogue. In Knights 765 Cleon <lb/>
            ranks himself next in merit to Lysicles, <lb/>
            Cynna, and Salabaccho ; and here she <lb/>
            holds a similar position in respect of <lb/>
            Cleophon, the leading demagogue of <lb/>
            the later years of the Peloponnesian <lb/>
            War. It was not however until some <lb/>
            months after the exhibition of this Play <lb/>
            that he commenced his fatal policy of <lb/>
            inducing the Demus to reject every <lb/>
            overture of peace from the Pelopon­ <lb/>
            nesian Confederacy.</p>
          <p>806. '<foreign xml:lang="grc">Αριστομάχην</foreign>] They identify the <lb/>
            names of '<foreign xml:lang="grc">Αριστομάχη</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">Στρατνίκη</foreign> with <lb/>
            the victory of Marathon, with which, <pb n="85"/>

              they say, no mail would venture to com­ <lb/>
              pete. The words <foreign xml:lang="grc">χρόνου πολλοῦ</foreign> are <lb/>
              usually connected with <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐγχειρε</foreign>î, <lb/>
              restrum a longo jam tempore He conatur <lb/>
              quidem <unclear>certare</unclear> ; but having regard to <lb/>
              their position, it seems more reasonable <lb/>
              to treat them as genitives of Age (as one <lb/>
              says, " a man <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐτῶν τριάκοντα</foreign> ”), the famous <lb/>
              battle of long ago.</p>
          <p>808. <foreign xml:lang="grc">Εὐβούλης</foreign>] This is an allusion to <lb/>
            the tame surrender by the popularly <lb/>
            elected Council of Five Hundred of their <lb/>
            high offices of state to the usurping <lb/>
            Four Hundred ; an event which, like the <lb/>
            defeat of Charminus, took place about <lb/>
            a year before the exhibition of the <lb/>
            present Play. On this subject, and its <lb/>
            bearing on the date of the Thesmo­ <lb/>
            phoriazusae, the reader is referred to <lb/>
            the Introduction. In the name <foreign xml:lang="grc">Εὐβούλη</foreign> <lb/>
            there is of course a play on the words <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">βουλείαν, βουλευτής</foreign>. And possibly the <lb/>
            speaker is referring to Eubule, one of <lb/>
            the three daughters of Leos (<foreign xml:lang="grc">τοῦ Λεὼ <lb/>
            κόραι</foreign>), who died to save Athens in her <lb/>
            hour of peril, and in whose honour the <lb/>
            grateful Athenians erected the <foreign xml:lang="grc">Λεωκόριον</foreign>, <lb/>
            the fane of the daughters of Leos. See <lb/>
            Aelian Y. H. xii. 28 and the Commen­ <lb/>
            tators there. And certainly the sacrifice <lb/>
            of Eubule and her sisters would furnish <lb/>
            a striking contrast to the pusillanimity <lb/>
            of the Five Hundred.</p>
          <p>809. <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐδ' αὐτός</foreign>] The speaker, as has <lb/>
            frequently been observed, is singling out <lb/>
            and addressing some one of the Five <lb/>
            Hundred, who was sitting as a spectator <lb/>
            in the theatre. It must be remembered <lb/>
            that the oligarchic Four Hundred had by <lb/>
            this time disappeared, and the popular <lb/>
            Council had been reinstated in its former <lb/>
            position.</p>
          <p>810. <foreign xml:lang="grc">εὐχόμεθ' εἶναι</foreign>] This line, as Dobree <lb/>
            pointed out, is modelled on the Homeric <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἡμε</foreign>î<foreign xml:lang="grc">ς τοι πατέρων μέγ' ἀμείνονες εὐχόμεθ' <lb/>

            will a Woman come driving in a carriage <lb/>
            and pair to the Acropolis" (as, she <lb/>
            implies, Men do), " having filched from <lb/>
            the public treasury 50 talents at a <lb/>
            time." Fritzsche thinks that the taunt <lb/>
            is levelled at Peisander, and doubtless <lb/>
            he was a notable offender in this line: <lb/>
            see Lysistrata 490. On <foreign xml:lang="grc">κατὰ πεντήκοντα <lb/>
            τάλαντα</foreign> (cf. Wasps 669) the Scholiast <lb/>
            remarks, <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐκεἶπεν πεντήκοντα, ἀλλὰ κατὰ <lb/>
            πεντήκοντα, τὸ συνεχὲς ἐκφαίνων</foreign>.</p>

            explanation is quoted by the Com­ <lb/>
            mentators without a word of dissent, 1 <lb/>
            presume that they acquiesce in it. But <lb/>
            it seems clearly wrong. <foreign xml:lang="grc">πόλις</foreign> means <lb/>
            the Acropolis ; and the expression <foreign xml:lang="grc">ζεύγει <lb/>
            ἐς πόλιν ἔλθοι</foreign> is exactly equivalent to the <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἅρμ' ἐλαύνῃς πρὸς πόλιν</foreign> of Clouds 69.</p>

              ful. We have the diminutive <foreign xml:lang="grc">φορμὶς</foreign> in <lb/>
              Wasps 58. The words <foreign xml:lang="grc">φορμὸν πυρῶν <lb/>
              τἀνδρὸς κλέψασα</foreign> are, I believe, universally <lb/>
              understood as explanatory of the pre­ <lb/>
              ceding <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἢν τὰ μέγισθ' ὑφέληται</foreign> ; " the <lb/>
              greatest of her thefts is to purloin a <lb/>

              and even that she replaces the very same <lb/>
              day." But though in my translation <lb/>
              I have followed this interpretation, I <lb/>
              very much doubt if it is the correct one. <lb/>
              It is difficult to understand how the wife <lb/>
              could replace the wheat she had pur­ <lb/>
              loined from her husband ; and equally <lb/>
              difficult, in this view, to give any mean­ <lb/>

              factory. The passage seems rather to <lb/>
              mean " A woman does not steal the <lb/>
              public money by the 50 talents, and <lb/>
              spend it in sumptuous equipages ; how­ <lb/>
              ever much of the public money she may <lb/>
              steal, she replaces it the same day, having <lb/>
              (for the purpose of replacing it) pur­ <lb/>
              loined a basketful of wheat from her <lb/>
              husband.” She replaces the public <lb/>
              money by the proceeds of the private <lb/>

              but as Aristophanes has transformed the <lb/>

              priate epithet of Egypt itself.</p>
          <p>857. <foreign xml:lang="grc">μελανοσυρμαῖον λεών</foreign>] It will have <lb/>
            been observed that Euripides in the <lb/>
            Helen provides his verb with two accu­ <lb/>
            satives, <foreign xml:lang="grc">πέδον</foreign>, plain, in the second line, <lb/>
            and <foreign xml:lang="grc">γύας</foreign>, fields, in the third, not <lb/>
            connecting the two by any copula. <lb/>
            Aristophanes ridicules this double <lb/>
            accusative by changing <foreign xml:lang="grc">γύας</foreign> into <foreign xml:lang="grc">μελανο­ <lb/>

            <foreign xml:lang="grc">μελανο</foreign>- is intended merely as a contrast <lb/>
            to <foreign xml:lang="grc">λευκῆς</foreign> ; whilst -<foreign xml:lang="grc">συρμαῖον</foreign> is an allusion <lb/>
            to the <foreign xml:lang="grc">συρμαία</foreign>, the purge and emetic <lb/>
            which, according to Herodotus, the <lb/>

            is a recognized epithet of Hecate, and <lb/>
            as such is employed by Aristophanes <lb/>
            elsewhere. Yet there was always a <lb/>
            certain quaintness about it ; and as we <lb/>
            are here dealing specially with the <lb/>
            Helen of Euripides, it is not unlikely <lb/>
            that Aristophanes is alluding to line 569 <lb/>
            of that Play, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὠ̑ φωσφόρ</foreign> ‘<foreign xml:lang="grc">Εκάτη, πέμόε <lb/>
            φάσματ</foreign>’ <foreign xml:lang="grc">εὐμενῆ</foreign>. Hecate was specially <lb/>
            invoked by women. See Frogs 1362, <lb/>
            and the note there.</p>
          <p>859. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐμοί</foreign>] In the Helen it is <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἡμι̃ν</foreign>, but <lb/>
            the sense is the same. Mine is a father­ <lb/>
            land nout unknown to fame, even Sparta ; <lb/>
            and Tyndareus was my father. As a <lb/>
            rule, the speeches of Mnesilochus before <lb/>
            the entrance of Euripides are borrowed, <lb/>
            with but little alteration, from the <lb/>
            soliloquy of Helen in the Tragedy before <lb/>
            the entrance of Teucer.</p>
          <p>861. <foreign xml:lang="grc">φρυνώνδας</foreign>] inemo veru, Phrynon­ <lb/>
            das. Phrynondas, though not an Athe­ <lb/>
            nian, resided at Athens during some <lb/>
            part of the Peloponnesian War. He <lb/>
            was a rogue of such superior and notable <lb/>
            rascality, that to call a man a Phrynon­ <lb/>
            das was equivalent to calling him a <lb/>
            cheut ; just as to call him a Melitides <lb/>
            (Frogs 991) was equivalent to calling <lb/>
            him a dolt. Aeschines (against Ctesiphon, <lb/>
            137. p. 73) intimates his opinion that <lb/>
            Demosthenes was far superior to Phry­ <lb/>
            nondas in his distinguishing charac­ <lb/>
            teristic. And Taylor, in his note on that <lb/>
            remark, to which Fritzsche refers, col­ <lb/>
            lects the various passages in which <lb/>
            Phrynondas is mentioned. Aristophanes <lb/>
            uses the name in a very similar fashion <lb/>
            in his Amphiaraus, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὠ̑ μιαρὲκαὶ Φρυνῶνδα</foreign> <lb/>
            Kai <foreign xml:lang="grc">πόνηρε σύ</foreign> ; and again in the Proagon, <lb/>
            though the words have not been pre­ <lb/>
            served. Eupolis too more than once <lb/>
            treats the name as synonymous with <lb/>
            "swindler." In Isocrates against Calli­ <lb/>
            machus (66) the speaker, after showing <lb/>
            how grossly Callimachus had perjured <lb/>
            himself, concludes, ., For him to accuse <lb/>
            me of lying is as though Phrynondas <lb/>
            were to upbraid me for rascality." So <lb/>
            Lucian (Alexander 4) says that the man <lb/>
            was the very prince <foreign xml:lang="grc">τῶν ἐπὶ κακία διαβοή­ <lb/>
            των</foreign>, superior to Eurybatus and Phrynon­ <lb/>
            das and other notorious rascals. Eury­ <lb/>
            batus and Phrynondas are frequently <lb/>
            coupled in this connexion. They are <lb/>
            so by Aeschines in the passage cited <lb/>
            above ; by Plato, Protagoras, chap. 16 ; <lb/>
            and by Apuleius in his Apology (ii. 564, <lb/>
            ed. Oudendorp), versutiam tam insi­ <lb/>

              to the same effect will he found in <lb/>
              Taylor's note. Here the Woman, dis­ <lb/>
              gusted with the knavery of Mnesilochus, <lb/>
              declares that he must he the son of <lb/>
              Phrynondas, the greatest swindler in all <lb/>
              the world. The Scholiast, after saying <lb/>
              that Phrynondas <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπὶ πονηρία διαβάλλεται</foreign>, <lb/>
              adds, <foreign xml:lang="grc">τινὲςδὲ καὶπατέρα αὐτῷφασὶν <lb/>

              the quotations from the Helen have <lb/>
              been taken from the heroine's soliloquy, <lb/>
              which forms the prologue of the Play. <lb/>
              That soliloquy is interrupted by the <lb/>
              entrance of Teucer, whose first words <lb/>
              are <foreign xml:lang="grc">τίς τῶνδ</foreign>’ <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐρυμνῶν δωμάτων ἔχει κράτος</foreign> ; <lb/>
              Here, instead of Teucer, Euripides enters <lb/>
              in the character of Menelaus, but his <lb/>
              first words are the words of Teucer. <lb/>
              The two lines which follow are not <lb/>
              borrowed from the Helen; but the <lb/>
              subsequent dialogue between Euripides <lb/>
              and Mnesilochus to the end of 881 is <lb/>
              altered from a dialogue occurring later <lb/>
              on in the Euripidean Play, between <lb/>
              Menelaus and an old lady who is keep­ <lb/>
              ing the door of the Palace. It is note­ <lb/>

              here, as the introduction of the wounded <lb/>

            whether Proteus is at home. But, un­ <lb/>
            like Mnesilochus, she is speaking the <lb/>
            truth.</p>
          <p>889. <foreign xml:lang="grc">τυμβήρεις ἔδρας</foreign>] This line does <lb/>
            not occur in the Helen, but the heroine, <lb/>
            before she has seen Menelaus, had re­ <lb/>
            ferred to her place of refuge as <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἔδρας <lb/>

          <p>S94. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπὶ, κλοπη̃ τοῦ χρυσίου</foreign>] This is <lb/>
            rather too bad of Critylla, for she knew <lb/>
            perfectly well the real errand on which <lb/>
            Mnesilochus had come, and that he <lb/>
            had not intruded himself amongst the <lb/>
            women for the purpose of stealing their <lb/>
            trinkets. This sort of theft, however, <lb/>
            seems to have been common enough. <lb/>
            Cf. Ach. 258. The next line appears to <lb/>
            be a parody, but not of any passage in <lb/>
            the Helen. As to <foreign xml:lang="grc">βάΰζε</foreign>, ef. supra 173.</p>

              so employs them in Knights 186, Lysi­ <lb/>
              strata 943. Everybody is familiar with <lb/>
              the New Testament examples, St. Matth. <lb/>
              xxiv. 36 ; Galatians i. 7, ii. 16. The <lb/>
              woman is not Theonoe the daughter of <lb/>
              Proteus, she is Critylla the daughter of <lb/>
              Antitheus, who comes from Gargettus, <lb/>
              now Garito, a village some miles to the <lb/>
              north-east of Athens on the road to <lb/>
              Mount Pentelicus. It was a deme, as <lb/>
              the Scholiast observes, <foreign xml:lang="grc">τῆς Αἰγηίδος φυλῆς</foreign>, <lb/>
              and was in later times celebrated as the <lb/>
              birthplace of Epicurus.</p>
          <p>902. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀνταυγεῖς κόρας</foreign>] This line does <lb/>
            not come from the Helen, but is doubt­ <lb/>
            less either borrowed from some lost Play <lb/>
            of Euripides, or composed in imitation <lb/>
            of his style. The epithet <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀνταυγεῖς</foreign> is <lb/>
            susceptible of two interpretations ; (1) <lb/>
            sunlikeeyes, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀντιμίμους ἡλίουτροχῷ</foreign>, " eyes <lb/>
            that do mislead the morn” ; <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἡλακὰς <lb/>
            ἀκτῖνας</foreign>, to employ the phrase with which <lb/>
            Heliodorus (Aethiopics ii. 16) describes <lb/>
            brightly glancing eyes ; and to some <lb/>
            extent like the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀνθήλιον πρόσωπον</foreign>, " the <lb/>
            countenance flashing like the sun," a­ <lb/>
            scribed to Athene in Eur. Ion 1550 ; (2) <lb/>

            προσώπους μοι στρέψον</foreign>, as the Scholiast <lb/>
            explains it ; and this is the general, <lb/>
            and I think the right, interpretation. <lb/>
            So Empedocles (Plutarch, De Pythiae <lb/>
            oraculis 12) says that the Sun, which <lb/>
            obtains its brilliance from the heavenly <lb/>

              calls the eagle <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀντωπὸν ἁλίῳ</foreign>, just as <lb/>
              Euripides (Iph. in Aul. 585) uses the <lb/>

              The next line is altered from Helen 557 <lb/>

            commencement of the Choephoroe has <lb/>
            been preserved only by its quotation in <lb/>
            the Frogs, so this line has been restored <lb/>
            to the Helen only from its quotation <lb/>
            here. It is absolutely necessary to the <lb/>
            Euripidean dialogue, but had fallen out. <lb/>
            doubtless because the following line <lb/>
            commenced with the same word '<foreign xml:lang="grc">Ελληνίς</foreign>. <lb/>
            The transcribers of Aristophanes had <lb/>
            been more careful, and Markland re­ <lb/>
            placed the line in the Helen from the <lb/>

              (s.v. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἰφύη</foreign>) also describe it as an <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἄγρον <lb/>
              λάχανον</foreign>. But this seems an error, <lb/>
              arising from the fact that there is un­ <lb/>
              doubtedly an allusion to the poet's <lb/>
              mother, and to the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἄγπια λάχανα</foreign> which <lb/>
              she is represented as selling, supra 387, <lb/>
              456. For Theophrastus, who frequently <lb/>
              mentions it, invariably classes it with <lb/>
              flowers, and not with potherbs. In <lb/>
              Hist. Plant. vi. 6. 11 he speaks of it as <lb/>
              woody, and having a woody root ; in vi. <lb/>
              8. 3 he says that it blossoms in summer ; <lb/>
              and in vii. 13. 7 he observes that the <lb/>
              blossoms come before the leaves. He­ <lb/>
              sychius (s.v. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἴφια</foreign>), after describing it <lb/>
              both as <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἄνθος</foreign> and as <foreign xml:lang="grc">λάχανον</foreign>, adds <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὃ <lb/>

              i. p. 86, identify it with the lavender <lb/>
              plant. Euripides would seem to be <lb/>
              wearing some lavender about him, <lb/>
              possibly a garland around his head, as <lb/>
              Pierson suggests, in his note on Moeris, <lb/>

              it should be remembered, Menelaus <lb/>
              does not believe that the lady is really <lb/>
              his wife, though he is. struck with the <lb/>
              wonderful likeness ; and therefore when <lb/>

              in times past. And the words <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὗτος, τί <lb/>
              κύπτεις</foreign> ; were addressed to Demus there, <lb/>

            Kuster rightly explains it. See Clouds <lb/>
            1212; Peace 842, 1020; Eccl. 1037. <lb/>
            The Archer is to take Mnesilochus <lb/>
            behind the scenes, and tie him to the <lb/>
            plank ; then to bring him out again, so <lb/>
            tied, on the stage, and watch him there. <lb/>
            Mnesilochus is accordingly taken out <lb/>
            after line 946, and is brought in again, <lb/>
            bound, after line 1000.</p>
          <p>931. <foreign xml:lang="grc">σανίδι</foreign>] The <foreign xml:lang="grc">σανὶς</foreign> was a straight <lb/>
            plank to which malefactors were bound, <lb/>
            often as a preliminary .to execution. <lb/>
            Duris, the Samian historian, said that <lb/>
            Pericles, after conquering Samos, carried <lb/>
            the Samian trierarchs and marines to <lb/>
            Miletus, and having tied them to planks, <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">σανίσι προσδήσας</foreign>, and exposed them for <lb/>
            ten days, had their brains beaten out <lb/>
            with cudgels; but Plutarch (Pericles <lb/>
            28), who records the statement, does <lb/>
            not believe a word of it. So when <lb/>
            Brutus condemned to death his own <lb/>
            sons, and the other youths who were <lb/>
            conspiring to bring back the Tarquins, <lb/>
            “ stabant deligati ad palum nobilissimi <lb/>
            juvenes : missique lictores ad sumendum <lb/>
            supplicium nudatos virgis caedunt, se­ <lb/>
            curique feriunt,” Livy ii. 5. The <lb/>
            plank was fixed perpendicularly in the <lb/>
            ground ; the culprit was in front with <lb/>
            his back to the plank ; and the process <lb/>
            does not seem to have been painful in <lb/>
            itself, though, like our pillory, it would <lb/>
            become so by exposure to the sun and <lb/>
            storms. So long as Mnesilochus was <lb/>
            personating Helen, it was appropriate <lb/>
            that he should have been sitting on the <lb/>
            altar of his own free will : but now that <lb/>
            he is to represent Andromeda chained <lb/>
            to the rock, it is desirable that he should <lb/>
            appear as a helpless victim tied to the <lb/>
            plank. <note type="footnote"> if 2 </note></p><pb n="100"/>

            Bergler thinks that <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἱστιορράφος</foreign> is a play <lb/>
            on the word <foreign xml:lang="grc">μηχανορράφος</foreign> with a con­ <lb/>

            stranger (873 supra) as a sailor of the <lb/>
            lowest class. But I suspect that in the <lb/>
            colloquial language of the day <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἱστιορ­ <lb/>
            ράφος</foreign> had come to mean a spinner of <lb/>

            Cleveland's description of Claud Halcro <lb/>

            to beg alms of the people one day every <lb/>
            year, “cavammanum asses porrigentibus <lb/>

            that a large sum of money had been <lb/>
            voted for his statue, held out his hand, <lb/>
            and said that he should like to have the <lb/>
            money instead. His action is described <lb/>
            by Suetonius (Vesp. xxiii) as " cavam <lb/>

            Homeric Hymn to Demeter 476. And <lb/>
            see infra 1151. This Chorus, if we except <lb/>
            the allusion to Pauson in the anapaestic <lb/>
            dimeters, and possibly the stanzas in <lb/>
            honour of Dionysus at the end, is ap­ <lb/>
            parently a genuine representation of the <lb/>
            service of dance and song which the <lb/>
            Athenian women were accustomed to <lb/>
            render at the Thesmophorian festival. <lb/>
            It is an invocation to the deities who <lb/>
            preside over the pursuits and pleasures <lb/>
            of their country homes ; to Apollo the <lb/>
            minstrel Archer, Artemis the huntress, <lb/>
            and Hera the marriage Queen; and <lb/>
            again, to Pan and the Nymphs, and the <lb/>
            pastoral Hermes; and finally to the <lb/>
            Wine-god Bacchus, into whose train <lb/>
            both Pan and the nymphs were ulti­ <lb/>
            mately absorbed. We miss in the invo­ <lb/>
            cation the names of the Twain, and the <lb/>
            great name of Athene ; but to these <lb/>
            three goddesses a special hymn is appro­ <lb/>

            painter, of small means and less cha­ <lb/>
            racter. Aristophanes in his first extant <lb/>
            play calls him <foreign xml:lang="grc">Παύσων</foreign> o <foreign xml:lang="grc">παμπόνηρος</foreign> <lb/>
            (Ach. 854), and in his last extant play <lb/>
            " the messmate, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ξύσιτος</foreign>, of Poverty" <lb/>
            (Plutus 602). He is such a devotee of <lb/>
            fasting, the Chorus go on to say, that <lb/>
            he will without intermission (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐκ τῶν <lb/>

              fashion of the old English dance “round <lb/>

              and romping dance (<foreign xml:lang="grc">χορομανὴς τρόπος</foreign>) <lb/>

            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπειδὴ μέλλουσιν ἐλθεῖν εἰς τὴν ᾠδὴν</foreign>, and <lb/>
            the emendation that I have made gives <lb/>
            the right sense and the right metre ; <lb/>
            though it is too prosaic to be introduced <lb/>
            into the text without brackets. The <lb/>
            meaning is, But ice must needs stay the <lb/>

              Daphnis in surprise and delight, when <lb/>
              he sees Chloe returning to her home. <lb/>
              The pair take pleasure in decorating the <lb/>
              grotto and fountain of the Nymphs, and <lb/>
              the statue of Pall beside the fir-tree ; to <lb/>
              that grotto and statue they run, so soon <lb/>
              as the advent of spring releases them <lb/>
              from their long confinement indoors ; <lb/>
              and finally when the lovers marry, they <lb/>
              settle down amongst their flocks and <lb/>
              herds, <foreign xml:lang="grc">θεοὺς σέβοντες, Νύμφας, καὶ Πᾶνα, <lb/>
              καὶ Ἔρωτα</foreign>. And Hermes <foreign xml:lang="grc">νόμιος</foreign>, the <lb/>
              pastoral deity of Arcady, was hardly <lb/>
              less closely associated with the Nymphs. <lb/>
              In Homer's Odyssey xiv. 435 the swine­ <lb/>
              herd Eumaeus dedicates a seventh part <lb/>
              of the meat <foreign xml:lang="grc">Νύμφῃσι καὶ Ἑρμῇ</foreign>, on which <lb/>
              Eustathius remarks, <foreign xml:lang="grc">δωρεῖται μοῖραν</foreign> 6 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Εὔ</foreign>- <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BELL_07_fig530.jpg"/></figure> <lb/>
              And on the present passage the Scholiast <lb/>
              says of Hermes, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἔφορος γὰρ τῶν θρεμμάτων</foreign> <lb/>
              o <foreign xml:lang="grc">θεός</foreign>. And indeed Hermes was himself <lb/>
              the father of Pan. In the Hymn to which <lb/>
              reference has already been made, we are <lb/>
              told that, at the birth of Pan, his mother <lb/>
              fled affrighted from her grotesque and <lb/>
              misshapen offspring, but Hermes took <lb/>
              him up and presented him to the as­ <lb/>
              sembled gods. However, in Lucian's <lb/>
              Twenty-second Dialogue of the Gods, <lb/>
              Hermes is thoroughly ashamed of the <lb/>
              relationship, and says to his ungainly <lb/>
              son, " When you and I are alone, we will <lb/>
              be good friends, but <foreign xml:lang="grc">πατέρα ὄρα μὴ καλέσῃς</foreign> <lb/>
              fAE, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀκούοντός γε τινός</foreign>.” Hermes is far the <lb/>
              principal personage in this invocation, <lb/>
              a fact which perhaps accounts for the <lb/>
              use of the singular <foreign xml:lang="grc">χαρέντα</foreign> just below ; <lb/>
              but the Nymphs naturally attracted the <lb/>
              greatest affection, and hence the epithet <lb/>
              applied to them, here and elsewhere, <lb/>
              <foreign xml:lang="grc">Νύμφαι φίλαι</foreign>, "the dear Nymphs.”</p>

            383, and 396, 397 of that Play. For now <lb/>
            the <foreign xml:lang="grc">διπλῆ</foreign> which superseded the ring- <lb/>
            dance is itself to be superseded ; and <lb/>
            the dancers are to enter upon a third <lb/>
            system of choral evolutions. Now they <lb/>
            are to sing of Bacchus and his train of <lb/>
            attendant Nymphs, sweeping with cries <lb/>
            of religious ecstasy along the hills and <lb/>
            glades of his own Cithaeron. Those <lb/>
            hills and glades had witnessed the por­ <lb/>
            tentous events which form the ground- <lb/>
            work of the Bacchae of Euripides ; the <lb/>
            frenzy of the Theban women, and the <lb/>
            tragic death of Pentheus. But it is not <lb/>
            of events like these that the worshippers <lb/>
            of the Twain are thinking. In their <lb/>
            song Cithaeron is echoing back nothing <lb/>
            but the joyous cries of religious exalta­ <lb/>
            tion. From the direction <foreign xml:lang="grc">τόρενε πασαν <lb/>
            ᾠδὴν</foreign>, shrill every song, we may possibly <lb/>
            infer that this Bacchic hymn in some <lb/>
            way imitated the shrill cries of the <lb/>
            enthusiastic Bacchanals.</p>

            such a hymn is more especially appro­ <lb/>
            priate to the divine patron of the drama <lb/>
            at the Dionysian festivals. And the <lb/>
            epithet <foreign xml:lang="grc">κισσοφόρε</foreign> in the prelude can <lb/>
            hardly have been used, and the reference <lb/>
            here to the ivy's clinging tendril can <lb/>
            hardly have been made, without the <lb/>
            thought that if the Play were successful, <lb/>

            a moment disguised as Perseus in the <lb/>
            Play, with his winged sandals, and the <lb/>
            Gorgon's head. His appearance in that <lb/>
            costume is a sign that he is coming as <lb/>
            Perseus to rescue Mnesilochus as Andro­ <lb/>
            meda, a character which the latter ac­ <lb/>
            cordingly sets himself at once to assume. <lb/>
            The Palamede and the Helen have proved <lb/>
            unsuccessful, and the third Play to be <lb/>
            travestied is the famous Andromeda, <lb/>
            which, the Scholiast informs us, was put <lb/>
            on the stage at the same time as the <lb/>
            Helen, <foreign xml:lang="grc">συνδεδίδακται τῇ Ἑλένῃ</foreign>.</p>

            the <foreign xml:lang="grc">πτερόεντα πέδιλα</foreign> with which Perseus <lb/>
            came flying through the air. Doubtless <lb/>
            in the Tragedy he entered flying by some <lb/>
            special machinery, which is probably <lb/>
            caricatured in the Comedy. But he does <lb/>
            not enter yet, and Mnesilochus com­ <lb/>
            mences by adopting to his own melan­ <lb/>
            choly position the Lamentation which <lb/>

              this arrangement may add to the liveli­ <lb/>

              in the view of Tyrwhitt and Elmsley that <lb/>
              Euripides does not enter as Perseus until <lb/>
              1098 infra, and that the entire Lamenta­ <lb/>
              tion from 1015 to 1055 is delivered by <lb/>
              Mnesilochus in the character of Andro­ <lb/>
              meda, in accordance with the original <lb/>
              transcript of the Ravenna MS. It is <lb/>
              most unlikely that Euripides, as Perseus, <lb/>
              should have appropriated part of the <lb/>
              Lament of Andromeda which was sung, <lb/>
              in the Play, before the appearance of <lb/>

              babbling, and allow her to continue <lb/>
              her Lament without interruption. But <lb/>

              settles down into an uninterrupted La­ <lb/>

              adopting the language of Andromeda, <lb/>
              is careful at the last moment to divert <lb/>
              the curse from his own head to that of <lb/>
              his gaoler. Of. supra 349. For a similar <lb/>
              transfer of a curse, see Catullus, xliv..20, <lb/>
              where the poet acknowledges his fault <lb/>
              in having listened to Sextius, promises <lb/>
              never to do it again, and prays, that, if <lb/>
              he does, a curse may fall non mi sed ipsi <lb/>
              Sextio. In order to preserve the point <lb/>
              in the translation, another line should <lb/>
              be added : <lb/>
              0 how they will chide me, and gibe, and deride me ! <lb/>
              And 0 that the flashing, and roaring, and dashing <lb/>
              Red bolt of the thunder might smite me in sunder <lb/>
              The Scythian who lingers beside me ! <lb/>
              where the "me" in the third line is <lb/>
              used as in the " Knock me at the gate " <lb/>
              of Shakespeare, or " Saddle me the ass " <lb/>
              of the Book of Kings. In Greek it should <lb/>
              be not <foreign xml:lang="grc">με</foreign> but <foreign xml:lang="grc">μοι</foreign>.</p>
          <p>1054. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἄχη ... πορείαν</foreign>] If these words' <lb/>
            are to be amenable to any laws of <lb/>
            grammar, they must be treated as, what <lb/>
            grammarians call accusatives in ap­ <lb/>
            position to an entire sentence, in order <lb/>
            to express an opinion or judgment upon <lb/>
            the contents of that sentence." The <lb/>
            phrases are certainly Euripidean, and <lb/>
            are, in all probability, taken from the <lb/>
            Andromeda itself, where they may have <lb/>
            been either " accusatives in apposition," <lb/>
            or little detached ejaculatory sentences <lb/>
            such as are found in almost every <lb/>
            Greek Tragedy, where two mourners are <lb/>
            mingling their lamentations together. <lb/>
            To take one example out of hundreds, <lb/>
            the speech of Helen <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὰ δ</foreign>’ <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐμὰ κατὰ <lb/>
            μέλαθρα πάθεα, πάθεα, μα̑τερ, οἲ</foreign> ’<foreign xml:lang="grc">γώ</foreign>. <lb/>
            (Helen 684) is a mere exclamation, <lb/>
            having no grammatical connexion with <lb/>
            anything which precedes, or anything <lb/>
            which follows. And the expressions <lb/>
            " throat-cutting agonies from the Gods ” <lb/>
            and the twilight journey close upon <lb/>
            the dead" may have been similar <lb/>
            ejaculations in the Andromeda. The <lb/>
            epithet <foreign xml:lang="grc">αἰόλαν</foreign> is by some translated <lb/>
            speedy, but the Scholiast explains it by <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">σκοτεινὴν</foreign>, and the word is so constantly <lb/>
            connected with Night (in the sense of <lb/>
            variegated by stars), <foreign xml:lang="grc">αἰόλη νὺξ, αἰολόχρως <lb/>
            νὺξ</foreign> and the like, that it seems to have <lb/>
            itself acquired the signification of <lb/>
            “nightly.”</p>
          <p>1056. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ΗΧΩ</foreign>] The MSS. prefix <foreign xml:lang="grc">Εὐριπ. <lb/>
            ἠχὼ</foreign>, and the Scholiast says, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὑποκρίνεται <lb/>
            Εὐριπίδης τὸ πρόσωπον τη̑ς</foreign> ’<foreign xml:lang="grc">Ηχοῦς</foreign>. But <lb/>
            this, as Tyrwhitt observed, is certainly <lb/>
            wrong. Euripides was seen equipped <pb n="115"/>

              as Perseus, supra 1009 ; and he comes <lb/>
              upon the stage in that character, infra <lb/>
              1098. It is impossible that between <lb/>
              these two lines he should make his ap­ <lb/>
              pearance in a woman's dress, infra 1073, <lb/>
              1090. And indeed, had he done so, <lb/>
              Mnesilochus would have spoken a few <lb/>
              lines after 1097, to give him time to <lb/>
              discard the woman's dress and reassume <lb/>
              the equipment of Perseus, but no interval <lb/>
              whatever is allowed for that purpose. <lb/>
              Add to this that in line 1061 Echo <lb/>
              speaks of herself as a personage distinct <lb/>
              from Euripides ; and I think that every <lb/>
              reader will be ready to say with Dobree, <lb/>
              "non puto Echûs personam egisse Euri­ <lb/>
              pidem." And, in truth, I do not believe <lb/>
              that Echo appears on the stage at all. <lb/>
              The Scythian could hardly have asked <lb/>
              Whence comes that voice ? had he seen an <lb/>
              actual woman in conversation with his <lb/>
              prisoner, and the latter's allusion to a <lb/>
              woman in the immediate neighbour­ <lb/>
              hood seems to be merely a jest at the <lb/>
              Scythian's expense. It is very unlikely <lb/>
              that in the Andromeda Echo appeared <lb/>
              in a bodily form, and here too I believe <lb/>
              that she was represented as vox et prae­ <lb/>
              terea nihil. It may be taken for granted <lb/>
              that the voice was that of the actor <lb/>
              who was personating Euripides, just as <lb/>
              in the Frogs the Choreutae first sing <lb/>
              the Frog-songs behind the scenes, and <lb/>
              then enter as the Mystical Chorus ; but <lb/>
              that is a very different thing from the <lb/>
              statement that Euripides is personating <lb/>
              the Echo. The two lines of the present <lb/>
              speech were, in the Andromeda, prob­ <lb/>
              ably spoken by some friend who entered <lb/>
              before the entrance of Perseus. The <lb/>
              idea of Echo entering into a rational <lb/>
              conversation is of course purely Aristo­ <lb/>
              phanic.</p>

            added Acharnians 563, Wasps 186, supra <lb/>

            <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐκ αἰρήσεις</foreign>; which Bothe defends on <lb/>
            the ground that the Scythian, being <lb/>
            half asleep, forgets that Mnesilochus <lb/>
            cannot stir hand or foot, and calls upon <lb/>
            him to catch the Echo. " Paene irascor <lb/>
            Bothio,” observes Fritzsche, "cui 'somni­ <lb/>

            two lines below, the imperative <foreign xml:lang="grc">λαβὲ</foreign> is <lb/>
            addressed neither to Mnesilochus, as <lb/>
            Bothe supposes, nor yet to any casual <lb/>
            passel--by, as Fritzsche suggests. It is <lb/>
            a mere formula of self-exhortation, like <lb/>
            the reiterated <foreign xml:lang="grc">λαβὲ</foreign> in Eumenides 125. <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὴ μιαρὰ</foreign>, of course, represents <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὴν μιαράν</foreign>.</p>
          <p>1097. <foreign xml:lang="grc">γύναικο</foreign>] The Scholiast says that <lb/>
            these words stand for <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὴν λάλον καὶ κατά­ <lb/>
            ρατον γυναῖκα</foreign>, but they seem rather to <lb/>

            compares the first line of the Phoenissae, <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὦ τὴν ἐν ἄστροις οὐρανοῦ τέμνων ὁδὸν</foreign>, and <lb/>
            the somewhat similar address to the Sun <lb/>
            in the Poet's epigram, preserved by <lb/>
            Athenaeus ii. 57 ; and Fritzsche adds <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">τέμνων κέλευθον</foreign> from Rhesus 423. Kuster <lb/>
            also cites the Latin phrase secare viam, <lb/>
            and the via secta of Lucretius v. 273 ; <lb/>
            and with the latter part of the line he <lb/>
            compares <foreign xml:lang="grc">τιθεὶς πόδα</foreign> Rhesus 571, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἁβρὸν <lb/>
            πόδα τιθεῖσ</foreign>’ Helen 1528, and other pas­ <lb/>
            sages. The epithet <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὑπόπτερον</foreign> is specially <lb/>
            appropriate to Perseus. In the very <lb/>

              <foreign xml:lang="grc">Φαλήν</foreign>; For Fritzsche is undoubtedly <lb/>
              right in holding that <foreign xml:lang="grc">πέρι</foreign> is not the <lb/>
              preposition (as the Scholiast and pre­ <lb/>
              vious Commentators had considered it <lb/>
              to be) but is intended to represent <lb/>
              <foreign xml:lang="grc">φέρεις</foreign> : cf. supra 1007. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ό δὲ Γόργος</foreign>, says <lb/>
              the Scholiast, <foreign xml:lang="grc">γραμματεὺς, ἀλλὰ καὶ βάρ­ <lb/>

              derived from Birds 1700, <foreign xml:lang="grc">βάρβαροι δ</foreign>’ <foreign xml:lang="grc">εἰσὶν <lb/>

              opinion, by “the writer Gorgos” the <lb/>
              Scythian means the eminent rhetorician <lb/>
              Gorgias of Leontini, who has already <lb/>
              been mentioned in the Wasps and the <lb/>
              Birds, and who was probably, at this <lb/>
              very moment, a resident at Athens ; <lb/>
              and possibly a spectator of the present <lb/>
              Comedy. In Plato's Symposium, chap. xx. <lb/>
              (198 c) there is a similar play of words <lb/>
              upon the Gorgon's head, and the head <lb/>
              of Gorgias of Leontini. And it may <lb/>
              be observed that Gorgias, Periander's <lb/>
              brother, who is introduced into Plutarch's <lb/>
              " Symposium of the Seven Wise Men " <lb/>
              (§ 17), is more commonly known as <foreign xml:lang="grc">Γόρ­ <lb/>

          <p>1104. <foreign xml:lang="grc">Γοργό</foreign>] The word is doubtless <lb/>
            used by the Scythian merely as an <lb/>
            exclamation of menace or derision, like <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">μορμὼ</foreign> in Knights 693, Theocr.xv.40. "Est <lb/>

            Fritzsche laughs at this notion, but it is, <lb/>
            I may observe, strongly supported by the <lb/>
            fact that <foreign xml:lang="grc">Γοργὼ</foreign>, as well as <foreign xml:lang="grc">Μορμὼ</foreign>, was <lb/>

            More probably, if not composed by Ari­ <lb/>

            was borrowed, like 1130 infra, from <lb/>
            some other of the Poet's tragedies. The <lb/>
            expression <foreign xml:lang="grc">γαμήλιον λέχος</foreign> is found in <lb/>
            Orestes 1050, and has already been em­ <lb/>

            a sense in which he himself employs it <lb/>

            <foreign xml:lang="grc">προσφέρειν μηχανάς</foreign> TItI is a metaphor, <lb/>

            having departed to perfect his new <lb/>

            relapse into their former condition. The <lb/>
            action is therefore for the moment at <lb/>
            a standstill, and the Chorus take the <lb/>
            opportunity of singing a little ode, <lb/>
            mostly in glyconics and dactylics. It <lb/>
            consists of two addresses ; the first to <lb/>
            Athene, the <foreign xml:lang="grc">Πολιοῦχος</foreign> of the City : the <lb/>
            second to the two Thesmophorian <lb/>
            Goddesses, Demeter and Persephone. <lb/>
            One would have expected these addresses <lb/>
            to be antistrophical, but it is certain <lb/>
            that they were not intended to be so. <lb/>
            The hymn to the Twain is almost en­ <lb/>
            tirely dactylic, and is singularly light <lb/>
            and airy, even more so, perhaps, than <lb/>
            the dactylics in the last song which the <lb/>
            Athenian Chorus sing in the closing <lb/>
            scene of the Lysistrata. The hymn to <lb/>
            Athene is more complicated. If we <lb/>

              <graphic url="ENG_BELL_07_fig565.jpg"/></figure><lb/>
              (1143, 1144), it consists of three <lb/>

              first triplet, having always a dactyl for <lb/>
              its base, may perhaps be more naturally <lb/>
              described as dactylic. The -xopov in <lb/>
              <foreign xml:lang="grc">φιλόχορον</foreign> is merely a long syllable re­ <lb/>
              solved into two short ones. As to the <lb/>

              national goddess. The <foreign xml:lang="grc">Παρθένος</foreign> is the <lb/>

            Perseus, now enters for the last time <lb/>
            disguised as an old music-woman, and <lb/>
            accompanied by an actor dressed up as <lb/>
            one of those <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὀρχηστρίδες</foreign> who were con­ <lb/>
            stantly associated with Athenian revelry, <lb/>
            and who were generally persons of in­ <lb/>
            different repute. See Ach. 1093, Clouds <lb/>
            996, Frogs 514-516, 542-548. The <lb/>
            dancing-girl is not represented by one <lb/>
            of the three Actors provided by the <lb/>
            State : they are now taking the parts <lb/>
            of Euripides, Mnesiloehus, and the <lb/>
            Scythian ; she is represented by a <lb/>
            Choregie Actor, that is to say by an <lb/>
            additional actor supplied by the Chore­ <lb/>
            gus at his own expense. Euripides does <lb/>
            not begin to talk in his new character <lb/>
            until twelve lines later, where the <lb/>
            Scholiast says <foreign xml:lang="grc">Εὐριπίδης ἐν σχήματι <lb/>

              The dance is described by Xenophon, <lb/>
              Anabasis V. ix. 9 (cf. Athenaeus, i. 27), <lb/>
              "Then," says he, " he danced the Per­ <lb/>
              sian dance, rattling his two targes <lb/>
              together, and he kept sinking down on <lb/>
              his haunches, and springing up again, <lb/>
              <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὤκλαζε καὶ ἀνίστατο</foreign> ; and this he did <lb/>
              rhythmically to the sound of an <foreign xml:lang="grc">αὐλός</foreign>." <lb/>
              This sinking on the haunches seems to <lb/>
              have been the special peculiarity of the <lb/>
              Persian dance, so that the entire dance, <lb/>
              as the Scholiast here observes, sometimes <lb/>
              went by the name of <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὄκλασμα</foreign>. See <lb/>
              Pollux iv. segm. 100. The same dance <lb/>
              is described by Heliodorus under the <lb/>
              name of " Assyrian." <foreign xml:lang="grc">Καὶ τοὺς μὲν αὐτοῦ</foreign> <figure type="illustration">

              iv. 17. We may perhaps infer from <lb/>
              this passage, coupled with 1217 infra, <lb/>
              that while Teredon played the <foreign xml:lang="grc">αὐλὸς</foreign>, <lb/>
              Euripides himself was playing the <foreign xml:lang="grc">π ηκτὶς</foreign> <lb/>
              or Lydian lute. Teredon seems, as <lb/>
              Fritzsche observes, to be the name of <lb/>
              a man, like Sarpedon, and not, as the <lb/>
              Scholiast supposed, the name of a <lb/>
              woman. And indeed it is very unlikely <lb/>
              that Euripides and Elaphium were ac­ <lb/>
              companied by a piper of their own : <lb/>
              the appeal is doubtless made to the <lb/>
              theatrical <foreign xml:lang="grc">αὐλητής</foreign>. See Eccl. 891 and <lb/>

            little hard upon the Scythian's manners, <lb/>
            for the dancing-girl, now subsiding to <lb/>
            the ground, now bounding up, and <lb/>
            whirling round with her whole body in <lb/>
            motion, might not altogether inaptly <lb/>
            be compared to " a flea upon a blanket." <lb/>
            Aristophanes was apparently the first <lb/>
            to use this metaphor, which in modern <lb/>
            times is not uncommon. In St. Ronan's <lb/>
            Well, chap. viii, a lawyer, speaking of <lb/>
            the difficulty of catching a poacher, <lb/>
            says " A poacher may just jink ye back <lb/>
            and forward like a flea in a blanket <lb/>
            (wi' pardon), hap ye out of ae county <lb/>
            and into anither." And the same <lb/>
            metaphor is employed at the end of the <lb/>
            first chapter of Redgauntlet.</p>
          <p>1181. <foreign xml:lang="grc">κατάθου μέν</foreign>] I have substituted <lb/>
            these words for the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἄνωθεν</foreign> of the MSS. <lb/>
            and editions, which seems to give no <lb/>
            sense. It is plain that Elaphium is <lb/>
            here directed to lay aside her upper <lb/>
            garment, which she resumes in 1189 <lb/>
            infra. And for this process <foreign xml:lang="grc">κατάθου</foreign> is <lb/>
            the regular word. <foreign xml:lang="grc">κατάθου ταχέως θοἰ­ <lb/>
            μάτιον</foreign> Plutus 926 ; where indeed the <lb/>
            next direction is (very much as here) <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἔπειθ' ὑπόλυσαι</foreign>. So in Clouds 497 <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἴθι <lb/>
            νυν κατάθου θοἰμάτιον</foreign>. The ostensible <lb/>
            purpose for which Elaphium is to dis­ <lb/>
            card her upper garment and her shoes <lb/>
            is that she may execute the evolutions <lb/>
            of the dance with still greater rapidity ; <lb/>
            and Euripides accordingly calls upon <lb/>
            the piper to quicken his tune, <foreign xml:lang="grc">αὔλει σὐ <lb/>
            θᾶττον</foreign>. But this is not the real purpose, <lb/>
            and it is not even quite certain that she <lb/>
            does in fact dance any more. All this <lb/>
            is merely a bait to beguile the Scythian <lb/>
            from his duty.</p><pb n="127"/>

            It was doubtless the only article of <lb/>

            mentioned that <foreign xml:lang="grc">δόλιος</foreign> (the God of craft) <lb/>
            was one of the special appellations of <lb/>
            Hermes, cf. Plutus 1157, Frogs 1143, <lb/>
            1144. How worthily he earned the <lb/>
            title on the very day of his birth, we <lb/>
            learn from the Homeric Hymn in his <lb/>
            honour.</p>
          <p>1203. <foreign xml:lang="grc">σύ μὲν ο̕ὖν κ.τ.λ</foreign>.] This derisive <lb/>
            exclamation, like that in 1226 infra, is <lb/>
            flung after the Scythian who has just <lb/>
            disappeared. " You be off with the girl, <lb/>
            and I will release your prisoner." Tu <lb/>
            igitur hinc proripe cursu, puellâ hâc <lb/>

            all the earlier Commentators. Fritzsche, <lb/>
            however, who is followed by the more <lb/>
            recent editors, considers <foreign xml:lang="grc">παιδάριον</foreign> to be <lb/>
            the vocative addressed to Teredon, You, <lb/>
            boy, be off, taking this ; the Scholiast ex­ <lb/>
            plaining TOUT! by <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὴν τοξοθήκην</foreign>, and, as <lb/>
            an alternative, <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὰ ὄργανα τῆς ὀρχηστρίδος</foreign>. <lb/>
            The reason for this construction is that <lb/>
            (to use the words of Enger) " <foreign xml:lang="grc">παιδάριον</foreign> <lb/>
            semper puerum significat." But this <lb/>
            is a heresy against which the ancient <lb/>
            grammarians with -one voice protest. In <lb/>
            other dialects, they say, <foreign xml:lang="grc">παιδάριον</foreign> always <lb/>
            means a boy ; in the Attic dialect it <lb/>
            means either a boy or a girl, <foreign xml:lang="grc">παιδάριον <lb/>

            θῆλυ λέγουσιν</foreign>. And so Pollux, Suidas, <lb/>
            and others. All that Fritzsche can oppose <lb/>
            to this array of authorities is the feeble <lb/>
            remark, that none of them state "puellam <lb/>
            istâ voce saepenumero indicatam esse." <lb/>
            And indeed he himself admits that " per <lb/>
            se <foreign xml:lang="grc">παιδάριον</foreign>, quippe deminutio verbi <lb/>

          <p>THE greater part of this translation was composed from memory, when <lb/>
            the translator had no copy of Aristophanes at hand. Consequently, it <lb/>
            everywhere departs from the sense of the original; words, sentences, and <lb/>
            even whole speeches have been omitted, transposed, or added; actives are <lb/>
            changed into passives, and vice versa; and sometimes the English goes <lb/>
            clean contrary to the meaning of the Greek. It was completed from <lb/>
            a copy of Bekker's Aristophanes, the text and arrangement of which <lb/>
            differ widely from the text and arrangement of the present edition. If <lb/>
            therefore any critic should observe that there is hardly a line in the <lb/>
            translation which represents the exact meaning of the original, let him <lb/>
            remember that the translator heartily agrees with him; habet confitentem <lb/>
            reum. Nevertheless it is hoped that even from this inaccurate version, <lb/>
            a reader, taking the Play as a whole, may obtain an idea, not altogether <lb/>
            inaccurate, of the Thesmophoriazusae of Aristophanes.</p><pb n="136"/>

          <p>Two elderly men are discovered, when the Play opens, pacing along an Athenian street. In one, <lb/>
            both by his gait and by his language, we at once recognize a Philosopher and a Genius. His <lb/>
            companion is a garrulous and cheery old man, evidently tired out by a long promenade. They <lb/>
            prove to be the poet Euripides, and Mnesilochus his connexion by marriage, in the translation <lb/>
            inaccurately styled his cousin. The latter is the first to speak.</p>

            Of your tongue's utterance, yet I heed them not. <lb/>
            I choose my dress to suit my poesy. <lb/>
            A poet, sir, must needs adapt his ways <lb/>
            To the high thoughts which animate his soul. <lb n="150"/>

          <p>MN. (Aside to Eur.) When you wrote Phaedra1, did you take her habits?</p>
          <p>AG. But when he sings of men, his whole appearance <lb/>
            Conforms to man. What nature gives us not, <lb/>

          <p>.IN. (As before.) Zounds, if I'd seen you when you wrote the Satyrs!</p>

            Anacreon, Alcaeus, Ibyeus, <lb/>
            Who when they filtered and diluted song, <lb/>
            Wore soft Ionian manners and attire. <lb/>

            Therefore his Plays were beautifully fair. <lb/>
            For as the Worker, so the Work will be.</p>
          <p>MN. Then that is why harsh Philocles writes harshly, <lb/>
            And that is why vile Xenocles writes vilely, <lb/>
            And cold Theognis writes such frigid Plays.</p>
          <p>AG. Yes, that is why. And I perceiving this <lb/>

          <p>EUR. (Sharply.) Pray, let us come to business, sir. MN. Say on.</p>
          <p>EUR. A wise man, Agathon, compacts his words, <lb/>

            Your burdens; that were foolishness indeed. <lb/>
            Each man must bear his sorrows for himself. <lb/>
            And troubles, when they come, must needs be met <lb/>

            I'm too much like a woman, and they'd think <lb/>
            That I was come to poach on their preserves.</p>
          <p>IN. Well, I must say that's not a bad excuse.</p>

            To hold amorning Parliament to-day <lb/>

            What shall be done about Euripides, <lb/>
            How best to serve him out; for that he's guilty <lb/>
            We all admit. Who will address the meeting ?</p><pb n="151"/>
            
          <p>MICA. I wish to, I. CRIERESS, Put on this chaplet first. <lb/>
            Order ! order ! Silence, ladies, if you please. <lb/>
            Slices learnt the trick ; she hems and haws; she coughs in preparation; <lb/>
            'I know the signs; my soul divines a mighty long oration.</p>
          <p>MICA. 'Tis not from any feeling of ambition <lb/>
            I rise to address you, ladies, but because <lb/>
            I long have seen, and inly burned to see <lb/>
            The way Euripides insults us all, <lb/>
            The really quite interminable scoffs <lb/>
            This market-gardener's son pours out against us <lb/>
            I don't believe that there's a single fault <lb/>
            He's not accused us of; I don't believe <lb/>
            That there's a single theatre or stage, <lb/>
            But there is he, calling us double-dealers, <lb/>
            False, faithless, tippling, mischief-making gossips, <lb/>
            A rotten set, a misery to men. <lb/>
            Well, what's the consequence ? The men come home <lb/>
            Looking so sour—O, we can see them peeping <lb/>
            In every closet, thinking friends are there. <lb/>
            Upon my word we can't do ANYTHING <lb/>
            We used to do; he has made the men so silly. <lb/>
            Suppose I'm hard at work upon a chaplet, <lb n="400"/>
            Hey, she's in love with somebody ; suppose <lb/>
            I chance to drop a pitcher on the floor, <lb/>
            And straightway 'tis, For whom was that intended ? <lb/>
            I warrant now, for our Corinthian 1 friend. <lb/>
            Is a girl ill ? Her brother shakes his head; <lb/>
            The girl's complexion is not to my taste. <lb/>
            Why, if you merely want to hire a baby. <lb/>
            And palm it off as yours, you've got no chance. <note type="footnote"> 1 These are all references to actual Plays of Euripides. This is from the <lb/>
            Stheneboea, the " Corinthian friend" being Bellerophon. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="152"/>
            They sit beside our very beds, they do. <lb/>
            Then there's another thing; the rich old men <lb/>
            Who used to marry us, are grown so shy <lb/>
            We never catch them now; and all because <lb/>
            Euripides declares, the scandal-monger, <lb/>
            An old man weds a Tyrant, not a wife. <lb/>
            You know, my sisters, how they mew us up, <lb/>
            Guarding our women's rooms with bolts and seals, <lb/>
            And fierce Molossian dogs. That's all his doing. <lb/>
            We might put up with that; but, 0 my friends, <lb/>
            Our little special perquisites, the corn, <lb/>
            The wine, the oil, gone, gone, all gone for ever. <lb/>
            They've got such keys, our husbands have, such brutes, <lb/>
            Laconian-made, with triple rows of teeth. <lb/>
            Then in old times we only had to buy <lb/>
            A farthing ring, and pantry-doors flew open. <lb/>
            But now this wretch Euripides has made them <lb/>
            Wear such worm-eaten perforated seals, <lb/>
            'Tis hopeless now to try it. Therefore, ladies, <lb/>
            What I propose is that we slay the man, <lb/>
            Either by poison or some other way; <lb/>
            Somehow or other he must die the death. <lb/>
            That's all I'll say in public: I'll write out <lb/>
            A formal motion with the clerkess there.</p>
          <p>CHOR. Good heavens ! what force and tact combined ! <lb/>
            0, what a many-woven mind ! <lb/>
            A better speech, upon my word, <lb/>
            I don't believe I ever heard. <lb/>
            Her thoughts so elean dissected, <lb/>
            Her words so well selected, <lb/>
            Such keen discrimination, <lb/>
            Such power and elevation, <lb/>
             <pb n="153"/>
            'Twas really quite a grand, superb, magnificent oration. <lb/>
            So that if, in opposition, Xenocles came forth to speak, <lb/>
            Compared with her <lb/>
            You'd all aver <lb/>
            All his grandest, happiest efforts are immeasurably weak !</p>
          <p>SECOND WOMAN. Ladies, I've only a few words to add. <lb/>
            I quite agree with the honourable lady <lb/>
            Who has just sat down : she has spoken well and ably. <lb/>
            But I can tell you what I've borne myself. <lb/>
            My husband died in Cyprus, leaving me <lb/>
            Five little chicks to work and labour for. <lb/>
            I've done my best, and bad's the best, but still <lb/>
            I've fed them, weaving chaplets for the Gods. <lb/>
            But now this fellow writes his Plays, and says <lb n="450"/>
            There are no Gods; and so, you may depend, <lb/>
            My trade is fallen to half; men won't buy chaplets. <lb/>
            So then for many reasons he must die; <lb/>
            The man is bitterer than his mothers potherbs. <lb/>
            I leave my cause with you, my sisters : I <lb/>
            Am called away on urgent private business, <lb/>
            An order, just received, for twenty chaplets.</p>
          <p>CHOR. Better and better still. <lb/>
            A subtler intellect, a daintier skill. <lb/>
            Wise are her words, and few; <lb/>
            Well timed and spoken too. <lb/>
            A many-woven mind she too has got, I find. <lb/>
            And he must clearly, <lb/>
            This rascal man, be punished most severely. <lb/>
            (The motion for putting Euripides to death having, so to say, been propose and seconded, <lb/>
            Mnesilochus rises to speak in opposition.)</p>
          <p>MN. Mrs. Speaker and ladies, <lb/>
            I'm not surprised, of course I'm not surprised, <lb/>
             <pb n="154"/>
            To find you all so angry and aggrieved <lb/>
            At what Euripides has said against is. <lb/>
            For I myself-or slay my babies else- <lb/>
            Hate him like poison, to be sure I do, <lb/>
            He's most provoking, I admit he is. <lb/>
            But now we're all alone, there's no reporter, <lb/>
            All among friends, why not be fair and candid ? <lb/>
            Grant that the man has really found us out, <lb/>
            And told a thing or two, sure they're all TRUE, <lb/>
            And there's a many thousand still behind. <lb/>
            For I myself, to mention no one else, <lb/>
            Could tell a thousand plaguy trieks I've played <lb/>
            On my poor husband; I'll just mention one. <lb/>
            We'd been but three days married; I'm abed, <lb/>
            Husband asleep beside me; when my lover <lb/>
            (I'd been familiar with him from a child) <lb/>
            Came softly scratching at the outer door. <lb/>
            I hear; I know " the little clinking sound," <lb/>
            And rise up stealthily, to creep downstairs. <lb/>
            Where go you, pray ? says husband. Where ! say I, <lb/>
            I've such a dreadful pain in my inside <lb/>
            I must go down this instant. Go, says he. <lb/>
            He pounds his anise, juniper, and sage, <lb/>
            To still my pains : I seize the water-jug, <lb/>
            And wet the hinge, to still its creaking noise, <lb/>
            Then open, and go out: and I and lover <lb/>
            Meet by Aguieus and his laurel-shade, <lb/>
            Billing and cooing to our hearts' content. <lb/>
            (With vivacity.) Euripides has never found out that. <lb/>
            Nor how a wife contrived to smuggle out <lb/>
            Her frightened lover, holding up her shawl <lb n="500"/>
            To the sun's rays for husband to admire. <lb/>
            Nor how we grant our favours to bargees <lb/>
             <pb n="155"/>
            And muleteers, if no one else we've got. <lb/>
            Nor how, arising from a night's debauch, <lb/>
            We chew our garlic, that our husbands, coming <lb/>
            Back from the walls at daybreak, may suspect <lb/>
            Nothing amiss at home. Then what's the odds <lb/>
            If he does rail at Phaedra ? Let him rail. <lb/>
            What's that to us ? Let him rail on, say I. <lb/>
            Phaedra indeed ! He might come nearer home. <lb/>
            I knew a woman, I won't mention names, <lb/>
            Remained ten days in childbirth. Why, do you think ? <lb/>
            Because she couldn't buy a baby sooner. <lb/>
            Her husband runs to every medicine-man <lb/>
            In dreadful agitation; while he's out, <lb/>
            They bring a little baby in a basket, <lb/>
            Bunging its mouth up that it mayn't cry out, <lb/>
            And stow it safe away till he comes home. <lb/>
            Then at a given sign she feebly says, <lb/>
            My time is come: please, husband, go away. <lb/>
            He goes; they open basket; baby cries. <lb/>
            0, what delight, surprise, congratulations ! <lb/>
            The man runs in ; the nurse comes running out, <lb/>
            (The same that brought the baby in the basket,) <lb/>
            A prodigy ! a Lion ! such a boy ! <lb/>
            Yourform, yourfeatures: just the same expression : <lb/>
            Your very image: lucky!, lucky man ! <lb/>
            Don't we do this ? By Artemis, we do. <lb/>
            Then wherefore rail we at Euripides ? <lb/>
            We're not one bit more sinned against than sinning.</p>
          <p>CHOR. What a monstrous, strange proceeding! <lb/>
            Whence, I wonder, comes her breeding? <lb/>
            From what country shall we seek her, <lb/>
            Such a bold audacious speaker? <lb/>
             <pb n="156"/>
            That a woman so should wrong us, <lb/>
            Here among us, here among us, <lb/>
            I could never have believed it; such a thing was never known. <lb/>
            But what may be, no man knoweth, <lb/>
            And the wise old proverb showeth, <lb/>
            That perchance a poisonous sophist lurketh under every stone. <lb/>
            0, nothing, nothing in the world so hateful will you find <lb/>
            As shameless women, save of course the rest of womankind.</p>
          <p>MICA. What can possess us, sisters mine ? I vow by old Agraulus, <lb/>
            We're all bewitched, or else have had some strange mischance befall its, <lb/>
            To let this shameless hussy tell her shameful, bold, improper, <lb/>
            Unpleasant tales, and we not make the least attempt to stop her. <lb/>
            If any one assist me, good: if not, alone we'll try, <lb/>
            We'll strip and whip her well, we will, my serving-maids and I.</p>
          <p>MIN. Not strip me, gentle ladies; sure I heard the proclamation, <lb/>
            That every freeborn woman now might make a free oration; <lb/>
            And if I spoke unpleasant truths on this your invitation, <lb/>
            Is that a reason why I now should suffer castigation ?</p>
          <p>MICA. It is, indeed: how dare you plead for him who always chooses <lb/>
            Such odious subjects for his Plays, on purpose to abuse us; <lb/>
            Phaedras and Melanippes too : but ne'er a drama made he <lb/>
            About the good Penelope, or such-like virtuous lady.</p>
          <p>MN. The cause I know ; the cause I'll show : you won't discover any <lb/>
            Penelope alive to-day, but Phaedras very many. <lb n="550"/>
            </p>
          <p>MICA. You will ? you dare ? how can we bear to hear such things repeated, <lb/>
            Such horrid, dreadful, odious things? Mx. 0, I've not near completed <lb/>
            The things I know; I'll give the whole : I'm not disposed to grudge it.</p>
          <p>MICA. You can't, I vow; you've emptied now your whole disgusting budget.</p>
          <p>Mx. No, not one thousandth part I've told : not even how we take <lb/>
            The scraper from the bathing-room, and down the corn we rake, <lb/>
            And push it in, and tap the bin. MICA. Confound you and your slanders</p>

          <p>CHOR, Now let us turn to the people, our own panegyric to render. <lb/>
            Men never speak a good word, never one, for the feminine gender, <lb/>
            Every one says we're a Plague, the source of all evils to man, <lb/>
            War, dissension, and strife. Come, answer me this, if you can; <lb/>
            Why, if we're really a Plague, you're so anxious to have us for wives; <lb/>
            And charge us not to be peeping, nor to stir out of doors for our lives, <lb/>
            Isn't it silly to guard a Plague with such scrupulous care ? <lb/>
            Zounds! how you rave, coming home, if your poor little wife isn't there. <lb/>
            Should you not rather be glad, and rejoice all the days of your life, <lb/>
            Rid of a Plague, you know, the source of dissension and strife ? <lb/>
            If on a visit we sport, and sleep when the sporting is over, <lb/>
            0, how you rummage about; what a fuss, your lost Plague to discover. <lb/>
            Every one stares at your Plague if she happens to look on the street: <lb/>
            Stares all the more if your Plague thinks proper to blush and retreat. <lb/>
            Is it not plain then, I ask, that Women are really the best ? <lb/>
            What, can you doubt that we are ? I will bring it at once to the test. <lb n="800"/>
            We say Women are best; you men (just like you) deny it, <lb/>
            Nothing on earth is so easy as to come to the test, and to try it. <lb/>
            I'll take the name of a Man, and the name of a Woman, and show it. <lb/>
            Did not Charminus give way to Miss-Fortune ? Do you not know it? <lb/>
            Is not Cleophon viler than vile Salabaccho by far? <lb/>
            Is there a Man who can equal, in matters of glory and war, <lb/>
            Lady Victoria, Mistress of Marathon, queen of the Sea ? <lb/>
            Is not Prudence a Woman, and who is so clever as she ? <lb/>
            Certainly none of your statesmen, who only a twelvemonth ago <lb/>
            Gave up their place and their duty. Would women demean themselves so' <lb/>
            Women don't ride in their coaches, as Men have been doing of late, <lb/>
            Pockets and purses distended with cash they have filched from the State <lb/>
            We, at the very outside, steal a wee little jorum of corn, <lb/>

            And the ancient umbrella by no means is done, <lb/>
            We are wielding it yet, as our Shield from the Sun. <lb/>
            But 0 for the Shafts, and the Thong of the Shield, <lb/>
            Which your Fathers in fight were accustomed to wield. <lb/>
            Where are they to-day? Ye have cast them away <lb/>

            Many things we have against you, many rules we justly blame; <lb/>
            But the one we now will mention is the most enormous shame. <lb/>
            What, my masters ! ought a lady, who has borne a noble son, <lb/>
            One who in your fleets and armies great heroic deeds has done, <lb/>
            Ought she to remain unhonoured ? ought she not, I ask you, I, <lb/>
            In our Stenia and our Scira still to take precedence high ? <lb/>
            Whoso breeds a cowardly soldier, or a seaman cold and tame, <lb/>
            Crop her hair, and seat her lowly ; brand her with the marks of shame; <lb/>
            Set the nobler dame above her. Can it, all ye Powers, be right <lb/>
            That Hyperbolus's mother, flowing-haired, and robed in white, <lb/>
            Should in public places sit by Lamachus's mothers side, <lb/>
            Hoarding wealth, and lending monies, gathering profits far and wide ? <lb/>
            Sure 'twere better every debtor, calm resolving not to pay, <lb/>
            When she comes exacting money, with a mild surprise should say, <lb/>
            Keeping principal and income, You to claim percentage due! <lb/>
            Sure a son so capital is CAPITAL enough for you. <lb/>

          </ab>
          <p>THERE are only two MSS. now known to exist, which contain the <lb/>
            Thesrnophoriazusae, viz.:</p>
          <p>R. The Ravenna MS.</p>
          <p>H. The Munich MS. (No. 492).</p>
          <p>There are two Aristophanie MSS. in the library of Munich ; but as <lb/>
            they do not overlap each other, one containing the Clouds, Frogs, <lb/>
            Ecclesiazusae, and Plutus, and the other the Lysistrata and Thesmo­ <lb/>
            phoriazusae, it seemed unnecessary to discriminate between them as <lb/>
            H. and H1.; and they are both cited as H.</p>
          <p>Both R. and H. were fortunately collated by Velsen, the prince of <lb/>
            collators.</p>
          <p>No part of the Thesrnophoriazusae was found in the MS. or MSS. <lb/>
            from which the learned Marco Musuro prepared the Aldine edition. <lb/>
            Both this play and the Lysistrata were first published in 1515 by <lb/>
            Bernard Junta as a supplement to his edition of the nine other plays <lb/>
            published earlier in the same year. He describes the manuscript from <lb/>
            which he took them as " ex Urbinate Bibliothecâ. antiquissimum Ari­ <lb/>
            stophanis exemplary and adds that it was so ancient "ut altera interdum <lb/>
            dictionis pars ibi desideretur." The two plays were omitted by Fracini <lb/>
            and Gormont, but reappear in Zanetti and all subsequent editions of <lb/>
            Aristophanes. <note type="footnote"> N 2 </note></p><pb n="180"/>

            published until 1901, after my edition of the Frogs and Ecclesiazusae <lb/>
            (Vol. V of this series) had been printed, so that I had not the assistance <lb/>
            of their excellent revision for these two plays.</p>
          <p>To a little dissertation on the Thesmophoria, published in 1820, <lb/>
            Wellauer appended a few valuable critical notes on the text of this <lb/>
            play, which are noticed, in their proper places, in this Appendix.</p>
          <p>This Comedy has been fortunate enough to attract two excellent <lb/>
            editors, Fritzsche and Enger: the former brimming over with learning, <lb/>
            originality, and wit, often making the most untenable suggestions, but <lb/>
            supporting them with a wealth of illustration and argument, which <lb/>
            extorts our admiration, even though it cannot convince; the latter <lb/>
            careful and sagacious, but far too fond (considering that he was the <lb/>
            younger man) of ostentatiously pricking the bubbles which his more <lb/>
            brilliant predecessor had blown. In his Preface he refers to the edition <lb/>
            published " a Francisco Fritzschio, magnae viro doctrinae, multaeque <lb/>
            lectionis, qui si modestius de se ipse sentiret, neque quidquid in mentem <lb/>
            venisset, id omne existimaret effutiendum, majore deniqne uteretur <lb/>
            prudentiâ atque cautione, multum posset ad Aristophanem et emen­ <lb/>
            dandum et rectius intelligendum conferre." Fritzsche was not the man <lb/>
            sit still under this rebuke, and in the Preface to his edition of the <lb/>
            Frogs, published in the following year, he took occasion to refer, apropos <lb/>
            of nothing, " nugis Robert! Engeri, qui si, impudentiâ depositâ, doctrinae <lb/>
            copiolas auxerit, forsitan aliquando literis nostris poterit prodesse." <lb/>
            Peace be to their ashes. We could ill have dispensed with the services <lb/>
            of either.</p>
          <p>Here, as in the Appendix to the Ecclesiaznsae, I have endeavoured <lb/>
            to give, not only a full synopsis of the reading of the MSS., but also <lb/>
            a general idea of the changes which have taken place, from time to <lb/>
            time, in the text of the printed editions. No Aristophanic text is so <lb/>
            corrupt as that of the Thesmophoriazusae; and therefore considerable <lb/>
            licence of conjecture is not only allowable but necessary. In the present <lb/>
            play, as well as in the Lysistrata, the Ravenna illS. fails to maintain <lb/>
            its usual high standard of accuracy. It is true that we have the <lb/>
             <pb n="182"/>
            Ravenna MS., says Fritzsche in his Preface, " At qui tandem Ravennas ? <lb/>
            Non is, quern in Nubibns, Ranis, Pluto, Equitibus, Vespis, Pace, Avibus, <lb/>
            merito admiramur; ne is quidem, quern in Acharnensibus et Eccle­ <lb/>
            siazusis, non per se et propter se, sed codicis incpiâ melioris, optimam <lb/>
            judicamus." And he goes on to declare, with some exaggeration, that <lb/>
            in these two plays it is distinguished " non tam lectionum proprietate <lb/>
            aut praestantiâ, quam mendorum et ineptiarum varietate."</p>
          <p>More fortunate than in the Ecclesiazusae, Brunck in this play had <lb/>
            access to H., a manuscript little, if at all, inferior to R.</p>

            dividing the line is really found in R. H. <lb/>
            and all editions before Brunck ; but as <lb/>
            they omit EY. at the commencement of <lb/>
            line 11, they give to Mnesilochus the <lb/>
            three lines and a half from <foreign xml:lang="grc">πω̑ς μοι <lb/>
            παραινει̑ς</foreign> to <foreign xml:lang="grc">μήθ' ὁρα̑ν</foreign> ; Bergler pointed <lb/>
            out that EY. should be prefixed to line <lb/>
            11 ; and Brunck, adopting this, gave <lb/>
            both 11 and 12 as one speech to Euri­ <lb/>
            pides, striking out the note of interro­ <lb/>
            gation and the EY. after <foreign xml:lang="grc">όρα̑ν</foreign>. And <lb/>
            this unfortunate change was followed <lb/>
            byInvernizzi, Bekker, Dindorf, Fritzsche, <lb/>
            Weise, and Bothe. Meanwhile Tyrwhitt <lb/>
             <pb n="183"/>
            and Dobree had suggested the true <lb/>
            mode of punctuating and dividing the <lb/>
            line : and even before their Adversaria <lb/>
            were published, though long after they <lb/>
            were written, it was restored by Thiersch. <lb/>
            Since then it has been adopted by <lb/>
            Enger, Bergk, and all subsequent <lb/>

            falls away to a conjecture of Bernays, <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">διττὴν δὲ χοάνην. ἀκοὴν δὲ χοάνης</foreign> R. H. <lb/>
            vulgo. Scaliger suggested <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀκοη̑ς δὲ χο­ <lb/>
            άνην</foreign>, and so Wellauer and Bothe. But <lb/>
            the dative <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀκοη̨̑</foreign> is required as a parallel <lb/>
            to <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὧ̨ μὲν βλέπειν χρὴ</foreign> two lines above. <lb/>
            It is equivalent, as Meineke said, to <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὧ̨ δὲ ἀκούειν χρή</foreign>. Bisetus thought that <lb/>
            the words <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀκοὴν δὲ χοάνης</foreign> might be used, <lb/>
            as a joke, for <foreign xml:lang="grc">χοάνην δὲ ἀκοη̑ς</foreign> ; a curious <lb/>
            joke. Both Reiske and Tyrwhitt sug­ <lb/>
            gested <foreign xml:lang="grc">δίκην δὲ χοάνης</foreign>. It is not an <lb/>
            observation of much importance, but <lb/>
            there is no instance of this use of <foreign xml:lang="grc">δίκην</foreign> <lb/>
            by Aristophanes. This suggestion is, <lb/>
            however, adopted by Enger and Blaydcs, <lb/>
            though the latter dissents from it in his <lb/>
            footnote. Fritzsche reads <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀκμη̨̑ δὲ χώνης</foreign> <lb/>
            as- if it were a question of Ether's <lb/>
            modus operandi.</p>
          <p>20. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἥδομαί γε</foreign> R. H. vulgo ; but by a <lb/>
            slight typographical error, very slight in <lb/>

            from Gelenius to Bergler (inclusive) <lb/>
            have <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἥδομαι γὰρ</foreign>.</p>

            <foreign xml:lang="grc">σιωπω̑ τὸ θύριον</foreign> must be adopting the <lb/>
            very words of Euripides. In the editions <lb/>
            called Scaliger's and Faber's, and in <lb/>
            Invernizzi, EY. is substituted for <foreign xml:lang="grc">γὸ</foreign>.</p>

            has been adopted by Bekker and every <lb/>

            now rendered certain by the discovery <lb/>
            that R., who gives the words to Mnesi­ <lb/>

            Weise says that no alteration is re­ <lb/>
            quired, since <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἑώ</foreign>- is to be read as one <lb/>

            <foreign xml:lang="grc">σίγα. τί λέγει</foreign>; which is read by Fritzsche <lb/>
            and Enger. Reiske proposed <foreign xml:lang="grc">σίγα. θΕ. <lb/>

            Meineke, always very inaccurate in his <lb/>

            The latter is brought into the text by <lb/>

            words ; and Dr. Blaydes suggests that <lb/>
            this verse should be assigned to the <lb/>
            actor, and that the following verse is <lb/>
            the response of the Chorus. “Nam in <lb/>

            became a part of the preceding speech ; <lb/>

            Brunck, though Zanetti and Farreus <lb/>

            ever, enclosed it in brackets, as in my <lb/>

            his editors in the Classical Journal sup­ <lb/>
            pose, but of showing that it was merely <lb/>
            a stage-direction : a fact which was also <lb/>
            recognized by Kuster in his notes. <lb/>
            Brunck and subsequent editors (except <lb/>

            many of them retain the corresponding <lb/>

            retains the first word <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὀλολ</foreign> and asks, <lb/>
            very sensibly, who would venture to <lb/>
            sweep away the stage-directions from <lb/>
            modern plays, and so increase the diffi­ <lb/>
            culty of understanding them To which <lb/>
            Enger solemnly replies that modern <lb/>
            editors ‘‘ non ducent fabulas, sed seri­ <lb/>
            bunt; ” as if Aristophanes did not also <lb/>
            write his plays, and as if the additional <lb/>
            fact that they were placed on the stage <lb/>
            under his superintendence did not con­ <lb/>
            stitute an additional reason for his <lb/>
            giving stage-directions. There seems <lb/>
            every reason to believe that these <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">παρεπιγραφαὶ</foreign> must have been intro­ <lb/>

            This is one of the hasty suggestions of <lb/>
            that brilliant scholar, which a little <lb/>
            further consideration would have led <lb/>
            him to retract. ‘<foreign xml:lang="grc">Ορέστεια</foreign> is properly <lb/>

            the like. Yet Dobree's mistake, in de­ <lb/>
            . fiance of all theauthorities, has been intro­ <lb/>
            duced into the text by Bothe, Thiersch, <lb/>
            Dindorf, Bergk, recentiores. And in a <lb/>

            corrected into <foreign xml:lang="grc">Λυκουργεία</foreign>. For <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἔρεσθαι</foreign> <lb/>
            (the present, rarely if ever used) Dindorf <lb/>

            racters he is describing. Whereupon <lb/>
            Mnesilochus remarks (either to Agathon <lb/>
            or to Euripides) " When you described <lb/>
            Phaedra, did you act like a harlot?" <lb/>
            And again, " When you describe Satyrs, <lb/>
            let me come and describe them with <lb/>

            Satyrs are represented on the stage." <lb/>

            H., <foreign xml:lang="grc">διδόναι γ'αὐτὸν</foreign>, which was read in <lb/>
            all editions before Brunck, except that <lb/>
            Zanetti and Farreus make matters worse <lb/>
            by omitting <foreign xml:lang="grc">αὐτὸν</foreign> altogether. Dindorf, <lb/>
            indeed, says that <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐμαυτὸν</foreign> was the original <lb/>

            firm this. Dawes proposed '<foreign xml:lang="grc">πιδοὒναι <lb/>

            Geldart. This, of course, is against <lb/>
            Porson's rule, " Post jusjurandum,qualia <lb/>
            sunt <foreign xml:lang="grc">υὴ Δία, νὴ τὸν Άπόλλω</foreign>, et cetera <lb/>
            hujusmodi, nunquam sequitur particula <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ΓΕ</foreign> nisi alio vocabulo interposito," and <lb/>
            he therefore in the present line would <lb/>
            read <foreign xml:lang="grc">Δήμητρ' ἔτ</foreign>', comparing Wasps 1442, <lb/>
            Clouds 814, Plutus 64. He thought that <lb/>
            the <foreign xml:lang="grc">γε</foreign> in this line arose "ex Kusteri <lb/>
            interpolatione," and was not aware that <lb/>
            it is given in both the MSS., but I do <lb/>
            not suppose that, had he been so aware, <lb/>
            he would have dealt with it differently. <lb/>
            See the first of the " Observations <lb/>
            variae " in his Adversaria, and his note <lb/>
            on the present line. But Porson's rule, <lb/>
            though undoubtedly embodying the <lb/>
            general usage, is certainly not without <lb/>
            exceptions (see Neil's note on Knights <lb/>
            698 and his Appendix [ to that play) ; <lb/>
            and I think that the present line is an <lb/>
            exception, and that Mnesilochus uses <lb/>
            the particle to emphasize the fact that <lb/>
            lie is swearing by the Thesmophorian <lb/>
            deity. Porson's emendation is, however, <lb/>
            accepted by Dindorf, Enger, and all <lb/>
            subsequent editors down to and in­ <lb/>

            which is found in the MSS., both here <lb/>
            and in 880 infra, and in the Scholium, <lb/>
            seems sufficiently authenticated by in­ <lb/>

            and Velsen. But the jingle is quite in <lb/>
            the manner of Aristophanes, and is very <lb/>
            suitable to the assumed character of <lb/>
            Mnesilochus. If, indeed, Thratta were <lb/>
            herself carrying the <foreign xml:lang="grc">πόπανα</foreign>, we should <lb/>
            expect the middle ; and Bergk therefore <lb/>
            suggests <foreign xml:lang="grc">καθελου̂</foreign> ; but here everything <lb/>
            is unreal: and we do not know from what <lb/>
            imaginary place the imaginary Thratta <lb/>
            is to take down the imaginary cist.</p>
          <p>285. <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸ πόπανον ὡς</foreign> Bentley, Hermann. <lb/>

            well have been a corruption of -ov <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὡς</foreign>. <lb/>

            Wellauer, De Thesm. Diss. p. 37, note. <lb/>
            And this is done by Bothe, Weise, and <lb/>
            Enger. Person in his Adversaria (on <lb/>
            Eur. Suppl. 901) suggested <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὰ πόπαν</foreign>’ <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὄπως</foreign>; but afterwards in his Aristo­ <lb/>
            phanica he is said by Dobree to have <lb/>
            preferred <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸπόπανον</foreign> Iva. The former <lb/>
            suggestion is adopted by Fritzsche, <lb/>
            Bergk, Meineke, and Holden ; the latter <lb/>
            by Blaydes and Velsen. For <foreign xml:lang="grc">ταιν θεα</foreign>î<foreign xml:lang="grc">ν</foreign>, <lb/>
            both here and in 948, 1151 infra, and <lb/>
            Wasps 378, Cobet would write <foreign xml:lang="grc">τοιν <lb/>
            θεο</foreign>î<foreign xml:lang="grc">ν</foreign>, and Meineke, Holden, Blaydes, <lb/>
            Velsen, and Hall and Geldart so write <lb/>
            it. It is true that the Twain Goddesses <lb/>
            are in adjurations uniformly styled <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὼ <lb/>
            θεὼ</foreign>, but in other cases the usage was <lb/>
             <pb n="195"/>
            by no means uniform. The Scholiast <lb/>
            on 566 infra says, <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὼ θεώ οὐκέτι δὲ το</foreign>î<foreign xml:lang="grc">ν <lb/>
            θεο</foreign>î<foreign xml:lang="grc">ν ἀλλὰ τα</foreign>î<foreign xml:lang="grc">ν θεα</foreign>î<foreign xml:lang="grc">ν</foreign>.</p>

            this line is a prayer for the welfare of <lb/>
            an imaginary boy. He read <foreign xml:lang="grc">ποσθαλίσκον</foreign>, <lb/>

            by Enger, Meineke, recentiores. But <lb/>
            this would require the article, as <foreign xml:lang="grc">θυματέρα</foreign> <lb/>
            above : and <foreign xml:lang="grc">Ποσθάληκον</foreign>, as a proper <lb/>

            the remainders of the two Choruses <lb/>
            diverging into very different metrical <lb/>

            tion of the language of either, though <lb/>
            where, as in the first word of the present <lb/>
            line, a very slight and immaterial change <lb/>
            will suffice to bring the two into har­ <lb/>

            vulgo) it is thought that the fourth <lb/>
            syllable should be long, or doubled into <lb/>
            two short syllables, to make the systems <lb/>
            correspond, but no probable alteration <lb/>
            has been suggested. Dindorf reads <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">εὕγματ</foreign>’ <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐκγενέσθαι</foreign> and is followed by <lb/>
            Bergk and Blaydes : Fritzsche reads <lb/>

            proposes <foreign xml:lang="grc">τάδε γ</foreign>’ <foreign xml:lang="grc">εὕγματα</foreign>, which does <lb/>
            not meet the difficulty, but is adopted <lb/>
            by Holden. Velsen reads <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἄπαντα τάδε <lb/>

            and so made the lines intelligible, but <lb/>
            at the expense of the metre. Weise <lb/>
            follows Brunck. Bothe went further, <lb/>

            <foreign xml:lang="grc">κερδῶν</foreign>, as six lines above. It seems to <lb/>
            me very probable that the words <foreign xml:lang="grc">κερδῶν <lb/>
            οὕνεκα ἐπὶ βλάβῃ</foreign> are a formula used in <lb/>
            the ’<foreign xml:lang="grc">Αρὰ</foreign>, and are repeated here, and <lb/>
            I have therefore, with Velsen and Hall <lb/>
            and Geldart, adopted Reiske's suggestion <lb/>
            as to line 366. Reiske, however, threw <lb/>
            back <foreign xml:lang="grc">χώρας</foreign> into line 365, so making <lb/>
            that line unmetrical ; and I have there­ <lb/>

            lamentable suggestion <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἢ μοιχοὺς ἀπά­ <lb/>

            his change on the theory (first, I believe, <lb/>
            propounded by Musgrave on Eur. Ion <lb/>
            23) that the wife of Cecrops was named <lb/>
            Agraulus, and their daughter Aglaurus. <lb/>
            But doubtless the mother and daughter <lb/>
            bore the same name ; Agraulus and <lb/>
            Aglaurus are merely different forms of <lb/>
            the same word ; and I suspect that the <lb/>
            true form in each case is Agraulus. If <lb/>
            the daughter is called Aglaurus by Hdt. <lb/>
            (viii. 53), Pausanias (i. 18), Hesychius <lb/>
            (s.v.'<foreign xml:lang="grc">Αγραυλος</foreign>), and Ovid (Met. ii. 777), <lb/>
            she is called Agraulus by Aristophanes <lb/>
            here, Plutarch (Alcibiades, chap. 15), <lb/>
            Apollodorus (iii. 14. 2), Ulpian on <lb/>
            Demosthenes De F. L. 346 (p. 348), and <lb/>
            Philochorus there mentioned. In the <lb/>

            λαυρος</foreign>. Dr. Blaydes, though he follows <lb/>
            Brunck, yet says very sensibly, '' Scri­ <lb/>
            pturae "<foreign xml:lang="grc">Αγραυλος</foreign> certe favet analogia <lb/>

            videtur undo derivari potuerit." There <lb/>
            seems no sense in altering the IIS. <lb/>
            reading for the purpose of making the <lb/>
            names of the mother and daughter <lb/>
            disagree: a disagreement which Apol­ <lb/>
            lodorus denies, and no ancient author <lb/>
            affirms. And see the Annotations of <lb/>

            reads oivov, but this is an entire mistake. <lb/>
            Pollux has a chapter (Book vi, chap. 2) <lb/>
            on the vessels appertaining to wine, <lb/>
            and amongst other things he mentions <lb/>
            the siphon, used for tasting wine. He <lb/>
            then adds as an independent sentence, <lb/>
            "Aristophanes uses the verb <foreign xml:lang="grc">σιφωνίζειν</foreign>." <lb/>
            It is impossible to say whether he is <lb/>
            alluding to the present, or to some lost, <lb/>
            passage of Aristophanes ; but assuming <lb/>
            him to refer to the present passage, he <lb/>
            is perfectly right. Aristophanes does <lb/>
            here use the verb <foreign xml:lang="grc">σιφωνίζειν</foreign>, and not <lb/>
            only so, but he of course means it to be <lb/>
            understood in the sense of drawing out <lb/>
            wine, though <foreign xml:lang="grc">παρὰ προσδοκίαν</foreign>, he sub­ <lb/>
            stitutes a<foreign xml:lang="grc">ΙΤον</foreign> for <foreign xml:lang="grc">οἶνον</foreign>. With the use <lb/>
            to which Aristophanes puts the verb <lb/>
            Pollux, whose work is a mere register <lb/>
            of words, has nothing to do ; and there <lb/>
            is not even a presumption that he read <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">οἶνον</foreign> here. The Scholiast and Suidas <lb/>
            both read <foreign xml:lang="grc">σι̑τον</foreign>. Nor is there a dis­ <lb/>

            followed by Meineke but by nobody <lb/>
            else. And Suidas is obviously quoting <lb/>

            and by Thiersch ,Dindorf, Weise, Blaydes, <lb/>

            apparently read by Grynaeus (though <lb/>

            The discovery that lines 667-686 are <lb/>

            naturally called forth a variety of at­ <lb/>
            tempts to bring the two systems into <lb/>
            exact metrical uniformity. That they <lb/>
            were originally uniform cannot be <lb/>
            doubted, but each system has fallen <lb/>
            into disrepair, and if we correct one by <lb/>
            the other, we may be altering a genuine <lb/>
            text to make it correspond with a cor­ <lb/>
            rupt one. Occasionally they can be <lb/>
            brought into conformity by an altera­ <lb/>
            tion which commends itself on other <lb/>
            grounds ; and occasionally the metre <lb/>
            shows which system is necessarily right: <lb/>
            But several scholars have gone beyond <lb/>
            these isolated points, and have elabo­ <lb/>
            rated complete systems, involving great <lb/>
            and (except for this purpose) unneces­ <lb/>
            sary alterations. These have met with <lb/>

            to, instead of being substituted for, the <lb/>
            erroneous reading. See on 693 infra. <lb/>
            All that I have done is to carry into <lb/>
            effect this intended correction, and <lb/>
            otherwise leave the MS. reading un­ <lb/>

            is adopted by Zanetti, Farreus, Brunck, <lb/>
            recentiores, except as hereafter men­ <lb/>
            tioned, and with the substitution of <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">γίνεται</foreign> for <foreign xml:lang="grc">τίνεται</foreign> by Junta and all other <lb/>
            editors before Brunck. In the words <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">παραχρῆμά τε γίνετοι</foreign> Bothe and Fritzsche <lb/>
            think that they detect a stage-direction <lb/>

            With <foreign xml:lang="grc">γίνεται</foreign>, the accepted reading in <lb/>

            or one <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἆ</foreign> omitted and so a single sena­ <lb/>
            rius formed. The latter alternative is <lb/>
            adopted by Weise and subsequent edi­ <lb/>
            tors : but both MSS. give the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἆ ἆ</foreign> as <lb/>
            extra metrum, and it is obvious that the <lb/>
            doubled <foreign xml:lang="grc">ποῖ</foreign> is more in character with <lb/>

            have suggested the omission of <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸ</foreign>, and <lb/>
            Person did the same, and this suggestion <lb/>
            is followed by all editions after Bekker <note type="footnote"> P 2 </note> <lb/>

            excepting Blaydes, who omits the <foreign xml:lang="grc">μοι</foreign> <lb/>
            instead. Fritzsche reads <foreign xml:lang="grc">δός μοι σφάγιον, <lb/>
            ὦ</foreign>.It seems to me that both <foreign xml:lang="grc">μοι</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸ</foreign> <lb/>
            are necessary, and as it seems clear that <lb/>
            the bowl for catching the victim's blood <lb/>
            was called either <foreign xml:lang="grc">σφαγεῖον</foreign> or <foreign xml:lang="grc">σφάγιον</foreign>, <lb/>
            I have followed Bentley, Bekker, and <lb/>

            afterwards, the line is a foot short. <lb/>
            There have been other suggestions for <lb/>

            Brunck substitutes <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀθλίῳ</foreign> for <foreign xml:lang="grc">μοι</foreign>, and is <lb/>
            followed by Dindorf and Bergk. Din­ <lb/>
            dorf proposed, however, to change <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">πλάται</foreign> into <foreign xml:lang="grc">πλάτας λαβεϊν</foreign>, retaining <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">γένοιτ</foreign>', and this is followed by Meineke <lb/>
            and Blaydes ; whilst Enger reads <foreign xml:lang="grc">πόθεν <lb/>

            are an actual quotation from Euripides, <lb/>
            whether from his Palamede or from <lb/>
            some other play : and if so, it may be <lb/>
            possible in this way to explain the <lb/>
            hiatus <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐμαὶ ἐγχειρεῖν</foreign>. Porson, however, <lb/>
            in his copy of Portus, marked a lacuna <lb/>
            after <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐμαὶ</foreign>, thinking that an anapaestic <lb/>
            dipody has dropped out; which Her­ <lb/>
            mann would supply by reading <foreign xml:lang="grc">μὴ ἀλλ' <lb/>
            ἐγχειρεῖν</foreign> I <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὑμᾶς ἔργῳ πορίμῳ χρή</foreign> This is <lb/>
            adopted by Meineke except that he <lb/>
            changes <foreign xml:lang="grc">μὴ ἀλλ</foreign>' into <foreign xml:lang="grc">νῦν δὴ</foreign>. Fritzsche <lb/>
            avoids the hiatus by reading <foreign xml:lang="grc">χρῆν ἐγχει­ <lb/>

            untouched. The hiatus in the next line <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">χρὴ ἔργῳ</foreign> (R. H. vulgo) admits of no <lb/>
            defence ; Bentley changed <foreign xml:lang="grc">χρὴ</foreign>) into <foreign xml:lang="grc">χρῆν</foreign>, <lb/>

            <foreign xml:lang="grc">Μενέλεως</foreign> are used indiscriminately by <lb/>
            Euripides in the Helen (1196 and 1215, <lb/>
            1003 and 1031) ; and there is not the <lb/>
            slightest reason for altering the MS. <lb/>

            should be transferred to the Woman, <lb/>
            and this must have been the reading of <lb/>
            the Scholiast, who says, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὅτι πονηροὶ οἱ</foreign> <figure type="illustration">

            cate that these words belong to a new <lb/>
            speaker, but do not say to-whom. All <lb/>
            the editions, except as hereinafter men­ <lb/>
            tioned, give them to Euripides, and <lb/>
            I think rightly. However, Bentley, <lb/>
            Tyrwhitt, Elmsley, and Dobree, four of <lb/>
            the greatest names in Aristophanic <lb/>
            literature, all proposed to transfer them <lb/>
            to the Woman. And at first sight <lb/>
            this is a very attractive suggestion ; <lb/>
            giving <foreign xml:lang="grc">ποίου</foreign> the meaning of scornful <lb/>
            repudiation which it so often bears in <lb/>
            Aristophanes Proteus indeed! Neverthe­ <lb/>
            less it cannot, I think, be right. Cri­ <lb/>
            tylla, as the next line shows, supposes <lb/>
            Mnesilochus to be referring to <foreign xml:lang="grc">Πρωτέως</foreign>; <lb/>
            (genitive <foreign xml:lang="grc">Πρωτέου</foreign>), and she would be <lb/>
            giving herself away, if she began by <lb/>
            repeating <foreign xml:lang="grc">Πρωτέως</foreign>, which could only be <lb/>
            the genitive of <foreign xml:lang="grc">Πρωτεύς</foreign>. " Neque enim," <lb/>
            says Enger, "hoc dicere potest 'quem <lb/>
            Proteum tu narras ? imo Proteam, sed <lb/>
            hie jamdudum est mortuus.'" Accord­ <lb/>
            ingly the alteration is rejected by all <lb/>
            editors except Bothe, Fritzsche, Blaydes, <lb/>
            and Yelsen. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ποίου</foreign> is a simple interroga­ <lb/>

            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἰφύων</foreign>, and Brunck accordingly settled <lb/>
            the line as in the present text. He is <lb/>
            followed by all subsequent editors except <lb/>
            Blaydes : and except that Thiersch, Din­ <lb/>

            both of Euripides and Aristophanes) <lb/>
            change <foreign xml:lang="grc">Μενελάῳ</foreign> into <foreign xml:lang="grc">Μενελέῳ</foreign>, and that <lb/>

            which some copyist would naturally add <lb/>

            Fritzsche, inserted it only after <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐ καιρή­ <lb/>

            whilst it implies an echo immediately <lb/>
            preceding, seems also to imply a pre­ <lb/>

          <p>1102, 1103. These two lines are <lb/>

            same word <foreign xml:lang="grc">Γοργόνος</foreign>. They are inserted <lb/>

            for <foreign xml:lang="grc">τί</foreign> before, but I do not think it <lb/>
            necessary to make the Scythian's jargon <lb/>
            consistent, and I have therefore retained <lb/>
            some words which recent editors have <lb/>
            altered to preserve the analogy.—<foreign xml:lang="grc">Γόργος</foreign> <lb/>

            <foreign xml:lang="grc">Γοργόνος</foreign>, omitting the preceding <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὴ</foreign> and <lb/>
            so making the line metrical. Thiersch <lb/>
            also omitted the preceding <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὴ</foreign> and wrote <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">Γόργο τῇ</foreign>. Dindorf proposed <foreign xml:lang="grc">Γοργῶ</foreign>, which <lb/>
            Weise reads, and Blaydes reads <foreign xml:lang="grc">Γόργου</foreign>. <lb/>
            Though accepting Fritzsche's reading, <lb/>
            I should myself have been inclined to <lb/>
            read <foreign xml:lang="grc">Γοργοῦς</foreign>, as in Eur. Orestes 1520, <lb/>
            1521 ; Phoen. 456 (Porson's reading). <lb/>
            In the edition of Portus the iota in <foreign xml:lang="grc">πέρι</foreign> <lb/>
            is, apparently by a defect in the type, <lb/>
            written ; and subsequent editors, restor­ <lb/>
            ing the iota, also retained the ; as a <lb/>
            note of interrogation : but Fritzsche <lb/>
            who was the first to understand the line <lb/>
            rightly, and to see that <foreign xml:lang="grc">πέρι</foreign> stands for <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">φέρεις</foreign>, struck out the note of interroga­ <lb/>
            tion here, and placed it after <foreign xml:lang="grc">λέγι</foreign> as in <lb/>

            The last two words of the line <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὴν Γορ­ <lb/>

            served that R. has a colon, and Junta a <lb/>
            full stop after <foreign xml:lang="grc">κεφαλή</foreign>. Euripides means <lb/>

            Bothe, Fritzsche, Blaydes. But <foreign xml:lang="grc">συβήνη</foreign> <lb/>
            is a form of the Scythian's own coinage, <lb/>

            meant the first syllable to be long or <lb/>
            short. In 1197 both MSS. spell it <foreign xml:lang="grc">συμ­ <lb/>

            cept Bergk. And Bergk, although in <lb/>
            his text he retained <foreign xml:lang="grc">δράσει</foreign> (the reading <lb/>
            of R. H. and of all editions before <lb/>
            Enger), yet suggested the arrangement <lb/>
            of this line, with <foreign xml:lang="grc">δρᾶσι</foreign>, which is adopted <lb/>
            by Meineke, Holder and Hall and Gel­ <lb/>
            dart, and in this edition. For in the <lb/>
            MSS. (and vulgo) the lines run <foreign xml:lang="grc">οἴμοι, τί <lb/>

            it is clear that <foreign xml:lang="grc">οἴμοι</foreign> should stand by <lb/>
            itself and <foreign xml:lang="grc">Ἀρταμουξία</foreign> be brought up <lb/>
            into the preceding line, so making a <lb/>
            perfect senarius. In the MS. arrange.­ <lb/>
            ment the senarius is a foot short, and <lb/>
            various suggestions were made for sup­ <lb/>

            is obvious that all three meant <foreign xml:lang="grc">τῃδὶ <lb/>

            sequent editors have taken it. Elmsley <lb/>
            (at Ach; 278) proposed <foreign xml:lang="grc">διώξει</foreign>, which is <lb/>
            adopted by Thiersch, Dindorf, Meineke, <lb/>
            and subsequent editors, but rejected by <lb/>
            Fritzsche, Enger, and Bergk. And as, <lb/>
            both here and in Knights 969 and <lb/>
            Clouds 1296, the MSS. have the active <lb/>
            form, and the active and middle forms <lb/>
            are admittedly employed by Attic <lb/>
            writers, there seems no sufficient reason <lb/>
            for departing from the authority of the <lb/>
            MSS. here. Cobet annexes the s taken <lb/>
            from <foreign xml:lang="grc">διώξεις</foreign> to the succeeding sentence, <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">διώξει ; 'ς τοὔμπαλιν</foreign>, and this too is fol­ <lb/>

            the line a foot short. Enger com­ <lb/>

            suggested the insertion of <foreign xml:lang="grc">ταχέως</foreign>, which <lb/>
            Blaydes inserts. Meineke added <foreign xml:lang="grc">τρέχε</foreign> <lb/>
            at the end of the line. Brunck's con­ <lb/>

          <p>" Mr. Rogers is doing a great service to culture and civilization. He needs <lb/>
            no praises, for it is obvious that his work is his delight. Of his edition the <lb/>
            words may be not inappropriately used ‘ Cras amet qui nunquam amavit, quique <lb/>
            amavit eras amet.’... It is with a thrill of pleasure that we read such lines <lb/>
            as Knights 756, 757, and 824-7, or the cretics of the old Acharnians in pursuit <lb/>
            of the peacemaker. Nor could anything be more like Aristophanes than the <lb/>
            mock oracles, which are really some of the best hexameters ever achieved.... <lb/>
            The reader ends, if he is a Grecian, by admiring Mr. Rogers much, but <lb/>
            Aristophanes still more ; if he knows no Greek, he ends with the desire to learn <lb/>
            enough himself to appreciate Aristophanes as Mr. Rogers appreciates him.”— <lb/>
            Morning Post.</p>
          <p>" These two volumes [the Acharnians and the Knights] are indeed <lb/>
            illuminating at all points. The scholar will find troublesome questions <lb/>
            of textual, historical, and critical import adequately met and answered by one <lb/>
            who is more than commonly qualified for the task. The student could hardly <lb/>
            have a safer guide; the reader for pleasure will enjoy Mr. Rogers's polished <lb/>
            and incisive wit, and the musical, and at times even haunting, quality of his <lb/>
            verse.”—Guardian.</p>
          <p>"The publication of Mr. Rogers's translation of Aristophanes is an event <lb/>
            of the first importance in English classical scholarship. It is indeed not only <lb/>
            a great translation, but a great edition of the Greek text also.”—Liverpool Courier.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">THE ACHARNIANS.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>The qualities which distinguished his previous renderings, ease and <lb/>
            lightness of touch, absence of superfluous verbiage, deftness and ingenuity, <lb/>
            reappear in the Acharnians. The translation is surprisingly faithful, and yet <lb/>
            is so spirited that it can be read with pleasure apart from the text. Nothing <lb/>
            drags or trails in it.... In his edition the translation is the principal thing, <lb/>
            and the Commentary is designed to supplement it with such information about <lb/>
            the manners of the time, the special allusions of the Play, and the business of <lb/>
            the stage as the ordinary cultivated reader desires. He works, in short, <lb/>
            with an eye to the immediate literary enjoyment of the piece ; his notes are <lb/>
            models of good English and good sense, and display a keen interest in the <lb/>
            life of Ancient Athens fortified and expanded by an interest in human life <lb/>
             <pb n="2"/>
            at large.... Our admiration of this series of version is great, and we offer <lb/>
            to Mr. Rogers our best wishes for the successful completion of the whole."- <lb/>
            The Times.</p>
          <p>“ For scholars of all degrees of scholarship there is a real treat in this <lb/>
            volume. It is heartily welcome.”—Pall Mall Gazette.</p>
          <p>" As good as it can be. The notes are as full of scholarship as the version <lb/>
            is of ingenuity and felicity."-Spectator.</p>
          <p>" To younger men, who range more wide than deep, and conceive that <lb/>
            the Germans are the only thorough guides to scholarship, Mr. Rogers should <lb/>
            be something of a revelation. He is master of the graces of his own language <lb/>
            no less than of Greek. The excellence of his translations is well known. The <lb/>
            main points which stand out, in this edition as in the others of the series, are <lb/>
            the abiding sanity of the editor, his judicial fairness in estimating varieties of <lb/>
            reading and rendering, and his intimate sense—we might almost call it the <lb/>
            intuitive sense-of the humour and the subtlety of Aristophanes.... We can <lb/>
            re-echo the epithet which Christians and pagans alike have bestowed on the <lb/>
            poet—<foreign xml:lang="grc">ὁ χαρίεις</foreign>. It is this charm, this ease and grace, which Mr. Rogers repro­ <lb/>
            duces for us so well in an age of slovenly English and unlovely worldlings.”— <lb/>
            Athenaeum.</p>
          <p>"Mr. Rogers's verse translation is of course the standard version. His <lb/>
            mastery of tetrameters of all kinds is unrivalled. His introduction and notes <lb/>
            present the same combination of erudition, literary taste, and common sense <lb/>
            that has endeared his previous commentaries to all lovers of Aristophanes. <lb/>
            We congratulate him most warmly on the successful completion of an edition <lb/>
            which is equally beloved by the scholar and the layman. He has translated <lb/>
            Aristophanes once and for all, and he may lay down his pen with the comfortable <lb/>
            assurance that his work will not be superseded.”—Cambridge Review.</p>
          <p>" The sparkling versions of the great comic dramatist made by Mr. Rogers <lb/>
            are praised both by scholars and by readers who, with small Latin and less <lb/>
            Greek, want to know something of the culture of the ancient world. It may <lb/>
            be doubted if he has ever been more happy than in the rendering of the <lb/>
            Acharnians. The Commentary is full of interest and learning, and especially <lb/>
            likely to please readers who do not care to let the lexicographer and gram­ <lb/>
            marian have all the talk when the business is the elucidation of a comic <lb/>
            poet.”—Scotsman.</p>
          <p>" It is difficult to find new terms of praise for Mr. Rogers's translations. <lb/>
            In the lyrics he is inimitable ; they go with a snap and a swing that make it <lb/>
            difficult to realize that they are translations.”—Manchester Guardian.</p>
          <p>"Mr. Rogers's name is known far and wide among classical scholars in <lb/>
            connexion with his work on the plays of Aristophanes, and nobody has done <lb/>
             <pb n="3"/>
            more than he to popularize the Athenian comedian's best work among modern <lb/>
            readers. A real service is performed to classical literature by the issue of the <lb/>
            present series, and it is undoubted that this publication will do much to extend <lb/>
            the area of the dramatist's public. The verse translation runs with a consistently <lb/>
            light and tripping measure, the Greek text is well censored, and the notes and <lb/>
            introduction are excellent.”—Manchester Courier.</p>
          <p>“The translation is excellent. How racy it is our readers will have seen <lb/>
            by our extracts; and not only is it far livelier than the well-known version of <lb/>
            Hookham Frere, but it also keeps considerably closer to the original. Lovers <lb/>
            of classical literature have long delighted in Mr. Rogers's scholarship and skill, <lb/>
            and will welcome the appearance of the present volume.”—Westminster <lb/>
            Gazette.</p>
          <p>" One of Mr. Rogers's always welcome volumes. Fully on the level of the <lb/>
            previous Plays.”—Glasgow Herald.</p>
          <p>" Another volume of Mr. Rogers's masterly edition of the great comic poet <lb/>
            will be another delight to scholars and to general readers. The verse <lb/>
            rendering on the pages opposite to the Greek text is worthy of the original. <lb/>
            It is surprisingly resourceful, spirited, and exact ; and it reads as an <lb/>
            independent English poem. It is a triumph of the translator's art. The whole <lb/>
            work is most capable and thorough-a signal credit to English scholarship.”— <lb/>

          <p>"After many years' study of Aristophanes, Mr. Rogers has reached <lb/>
            a position as his expositor which is recognized as supreme by the world of <lb/>
            scholarship and letters.... Thanks to him the English reader is able to <lb/>
            appreciate the brilliance of Aristophanes in dialogue, and that sense of fun and <lb/>
            point which makes him still abundantly amusing.”—Athenaeum.</p>
          <p>" Not only a translator who succeeds wonderfully in welding the English <lb/>
            language into the varied accents and rhythm of Greek poetry. To a fine sense of <lb/>
            the music and swing of the original he adds that minute knowledge of the <lb/>
            language, of the texts, and of the special history of the period which has enabled <lb/>
            him to produce an edition of The Knights ' that will appeal first to the Grecian <lb/>
            scholar, but also to unlearned folk. The translation is full of the humour and <lb/>
            pith of the original; and the notes, whether linguistic or explanatory, are such <lb/>
            as to make the volume complete in itself. The book is alive with that sort of <lb/>
            scholarship which makes the past live again.”—Scotsman.</p>
          <p>"We are very glad to see another volume of Mr. Rogers's admirable <lb/>
            translations. The dialogue is full of topical allusions which almost defy <lb/>
            translation, but Mr. Rogers has overcome all difficulties with his accustomed <lb/>
            skill.”—Spectator.</p><pb n="4"/>
            
          <p>"Mr. Rogers's work on Aristophanes is well known. His translation has <lb/>
            received, and deserves, high commendation. The introduction to the present <lb/>
            volume is a model of its kind. The English reader who follows the guidance <lb/>
            of Mr. Rogers is well equipped for appreciating somewhat of the comic spirit <lb/>
            of the great and daring Athenian.”—Evening Standard and St. James's Gazette.</p>
          <p>“ Mr. Rogers shows once more that command of metre which makes these <lb/>
            translations so agreeable to read, while the fidelity with which he has adhered <lb/>
            to the Greek is nearly perfect. With the usual excellent explanatory and <lb/>
            critical notes, this volume is as good as Mr. Rogers's ‘ Plutus,' and no higher <lb/>
            praise is needed.”—Pall Mall Gazette.</p>
          <p>" Few classical books find a warmer welcome than The Knights of <lb/>
            Aristophanes by B. B. Rogers.' His translation shows the qualities we have <lb/>
            learned to look for in him—vigour, wit, and spontaneous felicity. The notes <lb/>
            are breezy without being flippant, learned without being pedantic.”—Manchester <lb/>
            Guardian.</p>
          <p>"Mr. Rogers is as happy as usual in his rendering of the original; the <lb/>
            coarse jests of the rival ‘ mud-slingers,' Clean and the Sausage-seller, are <lb/>
            rendered palatable by ingenious tours de force; the fragments of exquisite lyric <lb/>
            in which Aristophanes soars high above the mire of conventional ribaldry are <lb/>
            charmingly rendered, and the verve and swing of the Parabasis find their <lb/>
            equivalent in Mr. Rogers's masculine trochaics.”—Nation.</p>
          <p>"One can only repeat one's expression of admiration for his literary <lb/>
            deftness and sober scholarship. The spirit of the original is reproduced in his <lb/>
            brilliant rendering with remarkable adherence to the language of the text, and <lb/>
            yet his version reads like an independent English drama. The notes are <lb/>
            very instructive, and the textual criticism in the appendix is full and judicious."- <lb/>
            Educational Times.</p>
          <p>"Another volume of Mr. B. B. Rogers's translation of Aristophanes is <lb/>
            a great event and a great pleasure. To admirable scholarship he adds a skill <lb/>
            in comic verse like Mr. Gilbert's, and a power which that writer's subjects <lb/>
            have never called for. To read The Knights’ in Mr. Rogers's version <lb/>
            is to read a brilliant English play, though there are no such plays in English <lb/>
            outside these translations. The notes at the foot of the page are not only <lb/>
            helpful and packed with learning of many kinds, but they are a delight to read <lb/>
            even apart from the text, for their curious lights upon literature, history, and <lb/>
            social life in Greece, down to cookery and children's games.”—Daily Chronicle.</p>
