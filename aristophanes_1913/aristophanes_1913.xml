          </head>
          <p>THE spring of the year B. c. 421 found Athens and Sparta alike weary of <lb/>
            the long continuance of the Peloponnesian War, and alike disposed to put <lb/>
            an end to the conflict upon any fair and honourable terms. The War had <lb/>
            now lasted exactly ten years: and as its fortunes alternated from side <lb/>
            to side, Athens at one time, and Sparta at another, had been reduced to <lb/>
            offer conditions of peace ; but hitherto the very events, which had caused <lb/>
            the offer to be made by one combatant, had themselves ensured its rejection <lb/>
            by the other. Now, for the first time, the wishes of both coincided; both <lb/>
            felt that they had far more to lose than to gain by a further prolongation of <lb/>
            hostilities; both were therefore eager to terminate the War, and the desire <lb/>
            of Peace was as ardent and as genuine on the one side as on the other.</p>
          <p>The LACEDAEMONIANS had commenced the war with the reputation of <lb/>
            invincible prowess, and with the general sympathy of Hellas strongly <lb/>
            manifested in their favour. And notwithstanding the warnings of their <lb/>
            wiser and more experienced counsellors, they had imagined that it would <lb/>
            be but an easy task for their great Confederacy to chastise and humble <lb/>
            the Imperial Republic which had dared to subjugate, and was holding in <lb/>
            tributary vassalage, so many Hellenic cities, formerly as free and inde­ <lb/>
            pendent as herself. They looked forward to a few1 short and decisive cam­ <lb/>
            paigns which would win them immortal glory, and the thanks and gratitude <lb/>
            of a liberated Hellas. These visions had been rudely and completely dis­ <lb/>
            pelled. The Peloponnesian vessels had been swept from the seas by the <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BELL_08_fig1.jpg"/></figure> <lb/>
               <pb n="x"/>
              Athenian navy : the Peloponnesian army had found no enemy to encounter, <lb/>
              no fame to acquire : its main occupation had consisted in ravaging the <lb/>
              harvests, and despoiling the homesteads, of Attica ; an occupation in­ <lb/>
              glorious in itself, and unlikely, as it seemed, to be productive of any <lb/>
              substantial effect upon the ultimate issue of the War. No doubt much <lb/>
              suffering and many losses were inflicted upon the Athenian people by this <lb/>
              series of devastations; but these were speedily and amply avenged by <lb/>
              incessant1 and destructive descents upon the Peloponnesian coasts, ex­ <lb/>
              tending even into the proper territories of Sparta herself. Far from <lb/>
              crumbling to pieces before the imposing forces of the Peloponnesian <lb/>
              Confederacy, the Republic of Athens, when once she had shaken off the <lb/>
              despondency occasioned in the earlier stages of the War by the pestilence <lb/>
              and the invasions, seemed to gather fresh elasticity from the dangers <lb/>
              which environed her, and almost to vindicate her right to empire, by the <lb/>
              intrepid activity with which she carried the War into the enemies! country, <lb/>
              assailing them on every side with strokes so nimble and rapid, as completely <lb/>
              to baffle and confound the proverbial slowness of the Spartan operations. <lb/>
              During the seventh, and the greater part of the eighth, years of the War, <lb/>
              the tide was setting strongly and steadily against the Lacedaemonian <lb/>
              cause. The happy audacity of the Athenian Demosthenes in occupying <lb/>
              and fortifying Pylus, was rewarded by the unlooked-for capture of the <lb/>
              Spartan troops upon the islet of Sphacteria, a disaster which shook the <lb/>
              Spartan reputation throughout Hellas, and inspired the numerous families, <note type="footnote"> 1 The annals of the War are full of such expressions as the following, with <lb/>
              respect to the operations of the Athenian fleets : <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἂλλα τε ἐκάκουν περιπλέοντες καὶ ἐς</foreign> </note> <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BELL_08_fig2.jpg"/></figure><note type="footnote"> <foreign xml:lang="grc">καὶ ἀποβάσεις ποιούμενοι ἐδᾐουν τὴν γη̃ν ἠμέρας μάλιστα έπτά</foreign>. iv. 54. The Laconian <lb/>
              farmers would never be safe from these sudden and unexpected forays; whilst the <lb/>
              Athenians would be sure to hear of the gathering Peloponnesian host long before <lb/>
              it crossed their frontier and commenced its work of devastation. </note> <lb/>
               <pb n="xi"/>
              who were in any way connected with the captives, with a personal interest <lb/>
              in the restoration of Peace. Henceforth the one idea of the Lacedaemonian <lb/>
              Government was to get rid of the War, and recover the captives. <lb/>
              Embassy after embassy was sent, to solicit peace from Athens: embassy <lb/>
              after embassy returned, to report that no peace could be obtained. The <lb/>
              Athenians declared that, if a Spartan army again crossed the borders of <lb/>
              Attica, the captives should at once be led out to execution; and having <lb/>
              thus secured immunity for their own country, they proceeded to assail and <lb/>
              ravage the coasts of Peloponnesus more incessantly and more system­ <lb/>
              atically than ever. Towards the close of the eighth year of the War we <lb/>
              find Athens the undisputed mistress of the seas; her triremes infesting the <lb/>
              whole Peloponnesian seaboard; her garrisons established in strongholds <lb/>
              commanding the peninsula on every side, at Nisaea, Methone, Cythera, <lb/>
              Pylus. We find peaceful Laconian towns surprised and sacked by her <lb/>
              flying detachments; the Aeginetans pursued into their Laconian asylum, <lb/>
              and massacred to a man j the Messenians, the deadliest enemies of the <lb/>
              Spartan name, firmly planted at Pylus ; the Helots deserting in numbers; <lb/>
              Ionian trophies erected on the very soil of Laconia itself; and the scattered <lb/>
              Spartan garrisons unable successfully to cope with their nimble and <lb/>
              ubiquitous adversaries. No wonder that the Lacedaemonians were dis­ <lb/>
              tressed and bewildered, when they found themselves I hemmed in on every <lb/>
              side by a system of warfare so novel and unexpected: whilst their own <lb/>
              prestige had suffered, and their high position been perceptibly lowered, <lb/>
              even amongst their own allies.</p>
          <p>In this strait a diversion was made in their favour by the brilliant <lb/>
            exploits of Brasidas towards the close of the eighth year of the War. <lb/>
            Throwing himself boldly into the midst of the Athenian dependencies on <lb/>
            the north-west shores of the Aegean, he detached city after city from the <lb/>
            Athenian empire, as much by his wise and conciliatory policy, his winning <lb/>
            and attractive character, and the confidence which his presence everywhere <lb/>
            inspired, as by his consummate military skill. But his countrymen, <note type="footnote"> 1 In the 55th chapter of his fourth Book, Thucydides paints in very forcible language <lb/>
            the anxiety and humiliation of the Spartans. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="xii"/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">πολέμων διαποντίων ἂπειροι</foreign> 1, were unable to appreciate his schemes and <lb/>
            combinations, which passed far beyond the contracted horizon of their own <lb/>
            narrow political traditions: it was mainly as affording an outlet for their <lb/>
            discontented and unoccupied soldiery, and as drawing out of the country <lb/>
            the most daring, and therefore the most dangerous, of the Helots, that <lb/>
            they had originally encouraged, or rather, perhaps, acquiesced in, his <lb/>
            adventurous enterprise: and his unlooked-for success was welcomed, not <lb/>
            for its own sake, but because it seemed to open a prospect of at length <lb/>
            recovering the Sphacterian captives. And hence it was that they were <lb/>
            unwilling to rely too much on the chances of war. Successes so easily <lb/>
            obtained might perhaps be as easily lost: Perdiccas, who had originally <lb/>
            invited their troops, had fallen off again to the Athenian alliance: <lb/>
            the passage through Thessaly was barred to reinforcements : and the <lb/>
            Spartans were eager to conclude a Peace while yet they had a fair <lb/>
            equivalent to offer in exchange for the captives.</p>
          <p>There was yet another circumstance which rendered the Spartan <lb/>
            Government peculiarly anxious at this moment to be at peace with <lb/>
            Athens. Their treaty with Argos, which had lasted for thirty years, <lb/>
            was on the eve of expiring, and grave apprehensions were entertained lest <lb/>
            the Argives were preparing to seize the opportunity of regaining, with <lb/>
            the assistance of Athens, their old traditionary predominance amongst the <lb/>
            Dorians of the Peloponnesus.</p>
          <p>The ATHENIANS, on their part, were equally desirous of effecting a <lb/>
            termination of hostilities. They had nothing to gain from the War, <lb/>
            which had, in fact, been forced upon them, and in which the struggle on <lb/>
            their side had been commenced merely to maintain, and not to extend, <lb/>
            their existing empire. At the first their hope had only been that they <lb/>
            might come out of the conflict with undiminished power and importance : <lb/>
            they had entered upon it with undisguised reluctance, and, indeed, a large <lb/>
            and powerful party had always been opposed to its continuance. And the <lb/>
            War had, from the outset, entailed upon them great and peculiar sacrifices. <lb/>
            The surrender of all the local institutions and country homes to which they, <note type="footnote"> 1 Thuc. i. 141.</note> <lb/>
             <pb n="xiii"/>
            beyond all other Hellenic peoples, had from time immemorial been devotedly <lb/>
            attached : the spectacle which met their eyes, as they gazed from their city <lb/>
            walls, of a rude and hostile soldiery pillaging their farms and vineyards, <lb/>
            hacking down their olives and fig-trees, and destroying all that they held <lb/>
            most dear: the exchange of the ease and freedom, the thousand pleasures <lb/>
            of a country life for stifling huts and cells, or rather for any hastily <lb/>
            extemporized shelter which they could find or construct (for there were no <lb/>
            roofs to accommodate the multitudes which kept pressing into the city): <lb/>
            and above all, the appalling visitation of the Pestilence which burst forth <lb/>
            with unprecedented fury amidst these overcrowded immigrants, cooped and <lb/>
            penned together in their miserable dwellings, so that " they died like sheep," <lb/>
            says the historian, " corpses piled on corpses about the wells, and in the open <lb/>
            spaces of the city": such were to Athens the immediate results of the <lb/>
            declaration of War. Her spirit sank before these accumulated calamities, <lb/>
            and she attempted to open negotiations for Peace. But her offers were <lb/>
            rejected: and stricken by disease, not only in the city but also in her fleets <lb/>
            and armies, she was compelled to carry on the War with an impoverished <lb/>
            treasury and a desponding population. Her energy, however, remained <lb/>
            unabated : and gradually the pestilence wore itself out; the Peloponnesian <lb/>
            invasions lost, by repetition, much of their terrors; and the Athenians, at <lb/>
            length, found their gallantry and perseverance rewarded by a series of <lb/>
            successes, culminating in that great and astonishing event-the capture <lb/>
            of the Spartan troops upon the islet of Sphacteria.</p>
          <p>The surrender of a Spartan army, an event unprecedented in History, <lb/>
            created a profound sensation throughout Hellas, and seems to have <lb/>
            stimulated to a prodigious degree the hopes and aspirations of Athens; her <lb/>
            ambition began to take a wider flight (<foreign xml:lang="grc">μειζόνων ὠρέγοντο</foreign>)1: and whereas <lb/>
            she had hitherto sought merely to maintain and secure her maritime <lb/>
            empire, she appears now for the moment to have conceived the idea of estab­ <lb/>
            lishing her supremacy over the Hellenic race as well by land as by sea.</p>
          <p>An invasion of Boeotia was the natural stepping-stone to the accom­ <lb/>
            plishment of these high designs. It was not the first time that Athens <note type="footnote"> 1 Thuc. iv. 21, 41. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="xiv"/>
            had cast a longing eye upon those rich pasturages, those lakes and plains <lb/>
            swarming with fish and fowl; and she had on one occasion succeeded in <lb/>
            acquiring, and actually maintained for nearly ten years, an ascendancy over <lb/>
            the whole Boeotian territory. The Boeotians, always inert and sluggish, <lb/>
            had never attempted to retaliate: they were content to repel, as best <lb/>
            they might, the efforts made for their subjugation, and never thought of <lb/>
            overstepping their own frontiers to carry on an aggressive warfare against <lb/>
            their active and enterprising enemy. And the Athenians, therefore, now <lb/>
            proposed, by a vigorous attempt, to reduce Boeotia wholly beneath their <lb/>
            influence and control. But their scheme, however well conceived, was ill <lb/>
            carried into execution; the various detachments failed to co-operate with <lb/>
            each other, and the ambitious hopes of Athens were at once dashed to <lb/>
            the ground by the signal overthrow which the Boeotians gave to the whole <lb/>
            Athenian army among the deep 1 ravines and sloping shrub-covered hills <lb/>
            over which the modern traveller passes as he journeys from Delium to <lb/>
            Oropus. All the military forces of Athens (excepting such as were at the <lb/>
            moment actually engaged on foreign service) seem to have been present <lb/>
            on that fatal field : and all were overcome and borne down by the sturdy <lb/>
            Boeotians, whose habit of gross and heavy eating (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀδηφαγία</foreign>) 2 dulled, in- <note type="footnote"> 1 "We begin to ascend over wild and uncultivated hills, overgrown with low <lb/>
            shrubs, and broken into deep furrows by the torrents which plough their way from <lb/>
            the higher mountains on our right in their course into the sea. It was an evening <lb/>
            in this season, at the beginning of winter, when the battle of Delium was fought. <lb/>
            It took place at about a mile to the south of the village from which it was named. <lb/>
            One of these sloping hills (<foreign xml:lang="grc">λόφος</foreign>) covered the Boeotian forces from the sight of <lb/>
            their Athenian antagonists. These abrupt gullies (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ῤύακες</foreign>) channelled in the soil <lb/>

              deed, their mental faculties ; but endowed their bodies with a weight and <lb/>
              strength which rendered them almost irresistible in the push of shields <lb/>

              grave of those splendid hopes to which Sphacteria had given birth. So <lb/>
              great and irreparable an overthrow not only 1 destroyed the newly-gained <lb/>
              reputation of the Athenian arms, but seems also to have given rise for the <lb/>
              first time to painful and distressing apprehensions at Athens 2, lest the <lb/>
              Boeotians, flushed with success, should throw off the singular reluctance <lb/>
              which they had hitherto always displayed to cross their own frontier (and <lb/>
              which had even wellnigh withheld them from attacking the invading <lb/>
              Athenian host on that border-land whereon the battle of Delium was fought) <lb/>

              And it would seem that the Athenian army became, to a certain extent, <lb/>
              demoralized 3 by its defeat, and lost those habits of obedience and discipline <lb/>
              which still distinguished the efficient and well-trained Athenian navy. <figure type="illustration">

              </p>
          <p>A still heavier blow was awaiting the Athenians. Brasidas was in <lb/>
            the midst of their invaluable possessions on the north-west coast of the <lb/>
            Aegean : city after city was falling away to him, each wishing to be the <lb/>
            first to revolt; Acanthus, Stagirus, the great and important town of <lb/>
            Amphipolis, Torone, Scione, Mende, were already in his hands; the whole <lb/>
            fabric of their empire was shaken to its centre. The flower of the <lb/>
            Athenian army was dispatched, under Cleon, to recapture Amphipolis; <lb/>
            but the troops were disorganized, the leader was incompetent, and they <lb/>
            were totally routed under the walls of Amphipolis, almost without striking <lb/>
            a blow. What effect this crushing defeat might have upon the Athenian <lb/>
            allies, it was of course impossible to conjecture; and Athens began to <lb/>
            repent that she had not, while yet on the vantage-ground of success, <lb/>
            accepted the favourable terms which the Spartans had then been ready <lb/>
            to give.</p>
          <p>Thucydides1 tells us that the two chief obstacles to peace had been Cleon, <lb/>
            the Athenian demagogue, and Brasidas, the Spartan general: Brasidas, <lb/>
            because of the success and the glory which he was gaining in the War; <lb/>
            Cleon, because in quiet times his malpractices would be more apparent and <lb/>
            his calumnies less easily believed. It was, indeed, chiefly through the <lb/>
            restless activity of Brasidas that the armistice for one year, which had been <lb/>
            concluded in the spring of B.C. 423 (very shortly after the battle of <lb/>
            Delium), had been rendered abortive; nor can we wonder if, with the <lb/>
            brilliant career which was then opening before him, he strained every <lb/>
            nerve to prevent its being closed by the ill-timed advent of Peace. The <lb/>
            battle of Amphipolis removed both these obstacles: Cleon was slain by <note type="footnote"> lament the absence of order and sound discipline in the Athenian commonwealth : </note> <figure type="illustration">

              a Myrcinian targeteer as he fled from the field of combat: Brasidas was <lb/>
              one of the seven who fell on the Lacedaemonian side.</p>
          <p>And now arose throughout Hellas an earnest and impatient yearning <lb/>
            after the Peace which, it was obvious, could not be long withheld 1. So <lb/>
            strong was the feeling that the War was about to determine, that hostili­ <lb/>
            ties were suspended by tacit consent, and the Spartan reinforcements, <lb/>
            under Rhamphias, turned back from Thessaly of their own accord : <lb/>
            partly, no doubt, for other reasons, but 2 " chiefly," says Thucydides, <lb/>
            " because they knew that, when they left Sparta, their Government was <lb/>
            bent upon making a peace."</p>
          <p>It was at this moment, when the prospect of the restoration of Peace <lb/>
            to Hellas was the one great topic which engrossed all hearts and tongues, <lb/>
            that Aristophanes composed the Comedy which, from its subject, he <lb/>
            named " The Peace." It was exhibited 3 at the great city Dionysia, in <lb/>
            the archonship of Alcaeus, March, B.C. 421. And hardly had it been <figure type="illustration">

              produced upon the stage, when the Peace of which it sang dawned upon <lb/>
              the Hellenic world. The Peace of Nicias was concluded in March or <lb/>
              April, B.C. 421, immediately after the great city Dionysia in the same <lb/>
              archonship of Alcaeus 1. It was no mere five years' truce, savouring of <lb/>
              tar, and dockyards, and naval preparations—no mere ten years truce, <lb/>
              savouring of intrigues and political combinations-not even a mere thirty <lb/>
              years' truce, to which the hopes of Aristophanes had, four winters earlier, <lb/>
              been limited—it was a Peace for fifty years, a term of which few, who <lb/>
              had served in the War, could reasonably expect to see the expiration.</p>
          <p>Almost immediately after the Peace, a defensive alliance was made <lb/>
            between the Athenians and Lacedaemonians, and the prisoners on each <lb/>
            side were released.</p>
          <p>So ended the first period of the Peloponnesian War, a period which, by <lb/>
            way of distinction, was subsequently, from the King who led the Spartan <lb/>
            armies at its commencement, called the Archidamian War.</p>
          <p>It is said in line 990 of this Play that the Athenians had for thirteen <lb/>
            years been languishing for want of Peace. And it was, therefore, at one <lb/>
            time contended by Paulmier and others that, inasmuch as the Pelopon­ <lb/>
            nesian War did not formally commence until the year B.C. 431, the Play <lb/>
            could not have been written until the year B. c. 419 or 418. But this <lb/>
            objection assumes that the peace between the Athenian Empire and the <lb/>
            Peloponnesian Confederacy had remained undisturbed by any hostilities <lb/>
            until the formal commencement of the Peloponnesian War: whereas, in <lb/>
            truth, for a period of fully three years before the actual declaration of war <lb/>
            on the part of the whole Confederacy, Athens had been incessantly <lb/>
            coming into collision with some of its principal members. Not only had <lb/>
            the Megarians, by a formal interdict, been excluded from all intercourse <lb/>
            with the Athenian empire; but the forces of Athens and Corinth had <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BELL_08_fig8.jpg"/></figure><note type="footnote"> 2 Acharnians 188-200. </note> <lb/>
               <pb n="xix"/>
              clashed in open and undisguised conflict, both on the east and on the west <lb/>
              coasts of Hellas, at Potidaea on the one side and at Corcyra on the other. <lb/>
              No less than ten States had taken part with Corinth in the first expedi­ <lb/>
              tion to Corcyra; and, when Athens actively interposed in favour of the <lb/>
              Corcyraeans, it was felt on all sides that the War was virtually begun. <lb/>
              The period which intervened before the Peloponnesian Confederacy, as <lb/>
              a whole, could be set in motion against Athens was anything but a period <lb/>
              of peace and tranquillity. Thucydides clearly regarded it as a mere <lb/>
              prelude to the more formal War: a season of trouble and uneasiness, <lb/>
              of broken treaties, of complaints and recriminations, of wars and rumours <lb/>
              of wars: the skirmishing which preceded the actual conflict of the great <lb/>
              Hellenic powers.</p>
          <p>It is, therefore, strictly accurate to say that in the year B. c. 421 the <lb/>
            Athenians had for thirteen years been deprived of the blessings of Peace : <lb/>
            nor is there any real contradiction, as has been alleged by some, between <lb/>
            such a statement as this, and those contained in the Acharnians and <lb/>
            the Knights 2. There the poet is referring to events-the exclusion of <lb/>
            the products of Boeotia from the Athenian market, and the flocking of the <lb/>
            country population into Athens-which happen to have been almost <lb/>
            exactly coincident in date with the formal commencement of the Pelo­ <lb/>
            ponnesian War. Here he is speaking of a state of conflict and disquietude <note type="footnote"> 1 Thucydides describes the origin of the War in the following manner : <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἣρξαντο <lb/>
            αὐτου̃ 'Αθηναι̃οι</foreign> Kat <foreign xml:lang="grc">Πελεποννήσιοι λύσαντς τὰς τριακοντούτεις σπονδάς</foreign> : and then referring <lb/>
            to the Corcyraean and Potidaean conflicts, he adds that they were ostensibly the <lb/>
            causes <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀφ' ὦν λύσαντες τὰς σπονδὰς ἐς τὸν πόλεμον κατέστησαν</foreign>.—i. 23. So in chap. 66, <lb/>

            says that the Athenians and Corinthians were openly warring against each other, <lb/>

          <p>The correct view was ably and successfully maintained yei, <lb/>
            Gray, and others. And the controversy is now set at rest, and the date <lb/>
            of the Play fixed'for the year B.C. 421, by the discovery of the valuable <lb/>
            chronological notice which forms the concluding portion of the Second <lb/>
            Argument (infra, page xli), and which was first transcribed by Bekker <lb/>
            from the Venetian MS., and published in the year 1829. The last <lb/>
            distinguished supporter of Paulmier's theory was Mr. Fynes Clinton, in <lb/>
            his " Fasti Hellenici," and he, in the Compendium published shortly before <lb/>
            his death, acknowledged his error and adopted the correct date. And, <lb/>
            indeed, it is surprising that any doubt should ever have been entertained <lb/>
            on the subject. The entire Play would have been an anachronism in <lb/>
            any other year. Not only do all the incidental historical notices scattered <lb/>
            throughout the scenes, the various circumstances of the several Hellenic <lb/>
            peoples, and the motives by which they were respectively actuated in the <lb/>
            negotiations for Peace, accord with this epoch, and with none other: not <lb/>
            only does the general tone of thought suit no other period of the War: <lb/>
            but the cardinal historical fact on which the Play itself is founded <lb/>
            absolutely excludes the possibility of any other date. Brasidas and Cleon <lb/>
            were dead (they died in the summer of B.C. 422): the Peace was not yet <lb/>
            made (it was made in the spring of B.C. 421).</p>

            is allowable) the most un-Aristophanic of all the extant Comedies of <lb/>
            Aristophanes. It has little of the inexhaustible merriment, the exuberant <lb/>
            vivacity, of his other Plays; and still less of that keen satire, that <lb/>
            exquisite wit, that occasional sublimity of sentiment, that grace and <lb/>
            elegance of thought and diction, which render his great masterpieces <lb/>
            such unrivalled combinations of almost every poetical excellence. The <lb/>
            plot is loose and disjointed; an important part of the Parabasis is <lb/>
            repeated from one of his earlier plays; and the production of a colossal <lb/>
            image of Peace is a somewhat clumsy and inelegant device, and, as such, <lb/>
            was justly assailed with ridicule by his able and witty antagonists 1, <lb/>
            Eupolis and the comedian Plato.</p>
          <p>Yet the Play is not without its own special and characteristic excel­ <lb/>
            lences. Its very defects were in some degree occasioned by the all­ <lb/>
            absorbing importance, at the moment, of the subject with which it was <lb/>
            dealing; and by the strong and earnest feelings which that subject was <lb/>
            everywhere calling forth. It was the gravity of the crisis in which and <lb/>
            for which the Play was written, which, to a certain extent, dulled the <lb/>
            vivacity and cramped the vigour of the great comedian. For years he <lb/>
            had been labouring in furtherance of peace, and in opposition to the <lb/>
            turbulent policy of Cleon; and now that Cleon was no more, the eager <lb/>
            anxiety with which men looked for the restoration of peace and goodwill <lb/>
            among the Hellenic peoples was almost too serious and too real for the <lb/>
            lighthearted raillery and ridicule in which, at all other times, Aristo­ <lb/>
            phanes loved to indulge.</p>
          <p>The Play breathes throughout a genuine appreciation of, and desire <lb/>
            for, the enjoyments of rural life ; a yearning such as all true countrymen, <lb/>
            pent within the limits of a great city, must at times experience for " the <lb/>
            fragrance of their old paternal fields." Few country scenes of antiquity <lb/>

            second instalment of the Parabasis of this Play ; " ou 1on respire, . says <lb/>
            M. Pierron, "une des plus fraîches senteurs de la campagne. "Je <lb/>

            ravissantes de la Paix, d'ou s'exhale je ne sais quel parfum d'idylle <lb/>
            antique." I</p>
          <p>And the Play abounds also, like all the writings of Aristophanes, with <lb/>
            genuine kindly Panhellenic sentiments, occasionally rising, amidst all the <lb/>
            burlesque with which they are surrounded, into a strain of almost solemn <lb/>
            and pathetic dignity, as in that beautiful address to Peace which may be <lb/>
            called the Consecration hymn.</p>
          <p>It is a serious defect in the constitution of the plot that the Play <lb/>
            naturally divides itself into two distinct sections, differing from each <lb/>
            other in purpose, in character, and even in locality. The first half of the <lb/>
            Play represents the Recovery of Peace from the celestial abodes: the <lb/>
            second exhibits the festivities and social enjoyments which welcome her <lb/>
            restoration to the earth. The Parabasis separates the two sections.</p>
          <p>The first half of the Play, at times, almost assumes the character of <lb/>
            a didactic historical poem, and becomes a most interesting supplement to <lb/>
            and illustration of the graver history of the Peloponnesian War. The <lb/>
            harmony which exists in all substantial points between the statements of <lb/>
            Aristophanes and those of Thucydides is only rendered more valuable <lb/>
            from the circumstance that the writers are regarding the same events <lb/>
            from totally different points of view. The historian records accomplished <lb/>
            events : the poet, for a moment, lifts the veil and gives us a glance at <lb/>
            the same events whilst yet in the process of accomplishment, an instan­ <lb/>
            taneous but complete and vivid glimpse of the underlying forces, of the <note type="footnote"> 1 Theatre d'Aristophane par Eugène Fallex, vol. i, pp. 6, 254. I take this <lb/>
            opportunity of acknowledging my obligations to M. Fallex (who has translated <lb/>
            many passages of Aristophanes with the accuracy of a scholar and with the elegance <lb/>
            and vivacity which befit a countryman of Molière) for the extremely kind and <lb/>
            courteous manner in which he permitted me to enrich this volume with the scenes <lb/>
            which he has translated from the Peace in his charming little work. I must also <lb/>
            thank Dean Milman for allowing me to cite in the Appendix his version of the <lb/>
            Parabasis. </note> <lb/>

            hopes, the fears, the suspicions, the doubts, the rivalries, which were <lb/>
            co-operating in their formation. The poet writes of the ever-shifting <lb/>
            panorama before his eyes, whilst the waves are yet in motion, the wind <lb/>
            perpetually changing, and it is all uncertain what the results may be. <lb/>
            The historian records the results when they have passed into the <lb/>
            irrevocable domain of fact, when the winds are laid, and the waves have <lb/>
            again settled down into a state of calm and motionless tranquillity. So <lb/>
            much the more striking is the accord which we everywhere find between <lb/>
            the light offhand touches of Aristophanes, and the well-considered judge­ <lb/>
            ments of Thucydides; and that, not merely when they are treating of <lb/>
            actual events, or estimating the conduct and character of individuals, but <lb/>
            also when they are tracing the various dispositions and tendencies of the <lb/>
            several Hellenic States.</p>
          <p>The historical portion of the Play terminates with the commencement <lb/>
            of the Parabasis : the social scenes which follow, though censured1 as not <lb/>
            directly advancing the action of the piece, yet exhibit much more of that <lb/>
            genial and mirthful pleasantry, which is one distinguishing characteristic <lb/>
            of Aristophanic Comedy.</p>
          <p>" The Peace " of Aristophanes was placed second at the Great Dionysia: <lb/>
            the prize was awarded to " The Flatterers" (<foreign xml:lang="grc">Κόλακς</foreign>) of Eupolis, and <lb/>

          <p>The Flatterers of Eupolis 2 appears to have fully deserved the victory <lb/>
            which it obtained. It was one of those vigorous outbursts of bitter <lb/>

            contemporaries : its object being Callias, the brother-in-law of Alcibiades, <lb/>
            and the wealthiest Athenian of his day, a voluptuary who squandered his <lb/>
            colossal fortunes with profuse and reckless extravagance upon every <lb/>

          <p>The Comedy was much esteemed by ancient critics, and more than thirty <lb/>
            fragments of it have survived to our own times.</p>
          <p>Little is known of the dramatic writings of Leucon. Meineke 3 cites <lb/>
            but three quotations from, or rather perhaps references to, his comedies; <lb/>
            and all three belong to this play of the Clansmen.</p>
          <p>In one point the three Comedies seem to have concurred: the Flatterers, <lb/>
            the Peace, the Clansmen alike contained an attack upon the greedy and <lb/>
            fawning character of the tragedian 4 Melanthius.</p>

              recognized two plays, writing thus : at all events in the Acharnians, or in <lb/>
              the Babylonians, or in the second Peace. And, indeed, there are many <lb/>
              scattered passages cited as from the Peace which are not to be found in <lb/>
              the existing Play."</p>
          <p>This is, I believe, the only passage in the whole range of ancient <lb/>
            literature in which any allusion is made to a second Play of the same <lb/>
            name as the present: and on this passage we may fairly make the <lb/>
            following observations:-</p>
          <p>(1). That beyond twice recording the success '<foreign xml:lang="grc">Αριστοφάνους Εἰρήνῃ</foreign>, <lb/>
            the didascaliae would probably give no information on the subject.</p>
          <p>(2). That the writer of the Argument had certainly never seen any <lb/>
            second Peace.</p>
          <p>(3). That Eratosthenes had certainly never seen any second Peace, and <lb/>
            had no grounds, excepting such as were furnished by the entries in the <lb/>
            didascaliae, for suspecting that such a Play had ever in fact existed.</p>
          <p>(4). That the language attributed to Crates does not by any means <lb/>
            necessarily imply that he had ever seen any second Peace; and, indeed, <lb/>
            it is highly improbable that he should have been acquainted with a Play, <lb/>
            the very existence of which had escaped the investigation of so learned <lb/>
            and industrious a student as Eratosthenes.</p>
          <p>(5). That the passages to which the author of the Argument refers <lb/>
            must have been invariably cited as from the Peace simpliciter, and cannot <lb/>
            in any instance have been cited as from the second Peace eo nomine.</p>
          <p>(6). That the old grammarians, citing passages from memory, are <lb/>
            constantly referring them to the wrong play ; and therefore the mere <lb/>
            fact that passages, cited as from the Peace, are not to be found in the <lb/>
            existing Play, raises little or no presumption of the existence of another <lb/>
            play of that name.</p>
          <p>The fragments of Aristophanes have been collected by Canter, <lb/>
            Coddaeus, Brunck, Dindorf, and Bergk 1. Their united researches have <note type="footnote"> 1 The collection of Aristophanic fragments contained in Meineke's Fragmenta <lb/>

            brought together six passages only cited as from the Peace, and not <lb/>
            found in the existing Play. Of these six fragments, one is from Pollux, <lb/>
            one from Stobaeus, one from Suidas, and the remaining three from <lb/>
            Eustathius. The earliest of these writers lived centuries after the time <lb/>
            of Eratosthenes; and it is very unlikely that they should have seen the play <lb/>
            which the research of that great scholar was unable to discover: and <lb/>
            even had they done so, it is absolutely incredible that after the doubts <lb/>
            expressed by Eratosthenes (with whose works they were well acquainted) <lb/>
            they should have invariably spoken of it simply as the Peace, without <lb/>
            ever in any way distinguishing it from the more celebrated Play of that <lb/>
            name, which had always been well and familiarly known.</p>
          <p>Let us now examine seriatim the six passages in question:-</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">I.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>The first is found in Pollux x, Segm. 188, where it is said, 'Ev yovv <foreign xml:lang="grc">τῃ̑ <lb/>

          <p>The words <foreign xml:lang="grc">Εἰρήνῃ γέγρπται</foreign> are omitted in some of the MSS. of <lb/>
            Pollux; and whether they are clue to Pollux himself or to some copyist, <lb/>
            it is, I think, highly probable that the reference intended is to the <lb/>
            existing Play, the writer recollecting that, towards the close of the <lb/>
            Comedy, Trygaeus does in truth recommend the conversion of the shield <lb/>
            to certain domestic purposes, though a well-cover is not among them.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">II.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>Stobaeus (Florilegium, Tit. lvi, ed. Gaisford) cites the two following <lb/>
            passages in commendation of the art of husbandry:-</p><figure type="illustration">

          <p>The second passage is vv. 556, 557, of the existing Play. And it has <lb/>
            been suggested with great probability that the heading '<foreign xml:lang="grc">Αριϭτοφάνους <lb/>
            Εἰρήνης</foreign> has been accidentally misplaced, " qui plurimorum," says Dindorf 1, <lb/>
            " in Stobaeo fons errorum fuit," and that the first passage is really taken <lb/>
            from the <foreign xml:lang="grc">Γεωργοὶ</foreign> (Farmers) of Aristophanes.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">III.</title>

          <p>The next passage is gleaned from Suidas, who explains <foreign xml:lang="grc">ήτήμερος</foreign> to be</p><figure type="illustration">
            <graphic url="ENG_BELL_08_fig13.jpg"/></figure>
          <p>Here we can fortunately at once detect and rectify the error; for Suidas <lb/>
            is but transcribing the Scholiast on Clouds, 699, where the line is cited <lb/>
            as being not <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐν Εἰρήνῃ</foreign> but <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐν 'Ολκάϭιν</foreign> (a play of a kindred character, see <lb/>
            the second Argument infra, p. xli). The transcriber was no doubt misled <lb/>
            from thinking of the exclamations of War in lines 243, &amp;c., of this play.</p>

          <p>Eustathius, Comment, on Il. x. 249, speaking of the word <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀνει̑ν</foreign>, says <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">δηλοι̑ τὸ πτίϭϭειν ὡς 'Αριϭτοφάνης ἐν Εἰρήνῃ δηλοι̑</foreign>. The word <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀνει̑ν</foreign> or <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">αἰνει̑ν</foreign> does not occur in the Peace, but it seems to have been used in the <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">Γεωργοί</foreign>. See Bergk's note on Fragm. ix of the <foreign xml:lang="grc">Γεωργοὶ</foreign> in Meineke's <lb/>

          <p>In the same Commentary, xxiii. 123, Eustathius, explaining the word <lb/>

            to line 1164 of the present Play; the verse which follows in Eustathius <lb/>

          <p>In the Commentary on Od. vii. 120, Eustathius says, '<foreign xml:lang="grc">Αριϭτοφάνης ἐν <lb/>
            Εἰρήνῃ ϭεμνύνων τὰς 'Αθήνας, μαρτυρει̑ ὡς διηνεκει̑ς ἐκει̑</foreign> at <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὀπω̑ραι</foreign>. This <lb/>
            is certainly an error: Eustathius should have said <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐν</foreign> ‛'<foreign xml:lang="grc">Ωραις</foreign>, not <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐν <lb/>
            Εἰρήνῃ</foreign>. ‛'<foreign xml:lang="grc">Οτι ἐν ται̑ς 'Αθήναις διηνεκει̑ς ἦϭαν αἱ ὀπω̑ραι πα̑ϭαι, μαρτυρει̑ <lb/>
            'Αριϭτοφάνης ἐν</foreign> ‛'<foreign xml:lang="grc">Ωραις</foreign>, says Athenaeus xiv, chap. 68. See also Id. ix, <lb/>
            chap. 14 1. Even Bergk2 admits that this passage cannot be claimed for <lb/>
            the second <foreign xml:lang="grc">Εἰρήνη</foreign>. Indeed, it is simply incredible that Eustathius, who <lb/>
            flourished in the twelfth century after Christ, should be familiarly citing <lb/>
            under the name of the Peace, that comedy of which the vast research and <lb/>
            prodigious learning of Eratosthenes could in the third century before <lb/>
            Christ detect no traces whatever.</p>
          <p>On the whole, therefore, we must, I think, come to the conclusion that <lb/>
            if any such play as the second <foreign xml:lang="grc">Εἰρήνη</foreign> ever existed, it had ceased to exist, <lb/>
            at all events under that name, before the time of Eratosthenes, and we <lb/>
            have no more materials than be had for deciding what was the exact <lb/>
            meaning of that entry in the didascaliae whereby it appeared that <lb/>
            Aristopbanes had, on two distinct occasions, exhibited a Comedy under <lb/>
            the name of the Peace. Did he exhibit the same play twice ? or did he <lb/>
            really write a second Play of that name ?</p>
          <p>Any answer which we may give to these questions must, of course, be <lb/>
            of a purely conjectural character; but to me it seems extremely im­ <lb/>
            probable that the present Play should have been produced on the stage a <lb/>
            second time. It was written for the particular crisis which was occurring <lb/>
            in B.C. 421 , and would have lost all its point and piquancy when repeated <lb/>
            on any subsequent occasion. Moreover it did not pretend to any very <lb/>
            special merits, was not greatly successful at its first appearance, and bad <lb/>
            been made a subject of ridicule by the poet's contemporaries. On the <lb/>
            other hand, it is in no way improbable that Aristophanes should, at some <lb/>
            later epoch, have endeavoured to work out in a bappier vein and with <note type="footnote"> 1 The passage referred to is that of which the two first lines are cited and <lb/>

            improved execution the general conception embodied in this Comedy, <lb/>
            omitting the devices which had been censured for their extravagance or <lb/>
            impropriety, and adapting the incidents of the drama to the altered <lb/>
            circumstances of the times. And if he retained his <foreign xml:lang="grc">Χορὸς γεωργω̑ν</foreign>, he <lb/>
            would be likely enough to have followed his usual practice of naming the <lb/>
            Play from the Chorus (as is the case in eight out of his eleven extant <lb/>
            comedies), so that the second <foreign xml:lang="grc">Εἰρνη</foreign> would, for distinction's sake, be also <lb/>
            called the <foreign xml:lang="grc">Γεωργοὶ</foreign>, or the Farmers. And since we know that Aristophanes1 <lb/>
            did in fact write a comedy under that name, and since the fragments <lb/>
            of it which still remain do in fact bear in many points a singularly <lb/>
            close resemblance to the Play before us, there is nothing unreasonable <lb/>
            in the conjecture (and, of course, it is merely a conjecture) that the <lb/>
            Play, which when acted bore the same name as the present, is that which <lb/>
            was afterwards called by the distinctive appellation of the <foreign xml:lang="grc">Γεωργοί</foreign>.</p>

            was accustomed to pour out upon every subject which came in his way <note type="footnote"> 1 Plutarch (Nicias, chap. 8), speaking of the affair at Pylus, says that the conduct <lb/>

            censure, and he adds, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ϭκωπτει δ' αὐτὀν εἰς ταυ̑τα πλιν 'Αριϭτοφάνης ἐν μὲν "Ορνιϭιν</foreign> </note><figure type="illustration">

              about the time of the Knights." But it would surely have been more reasonable to <lb/>
              infer that it was exhibited about the same time as the Birds. And in fact I believe <lb/>
              that in both plays Aristophanes is primarily referring to the extreme backwardness <lb/>
              and reluctance displayed by Nicias in regard not to the Sphacterian enterprise, but <lb/>
              to the Sicilian expedition. Such, at all events, is the explanation given of the lines <lb/>

              this hastily conceived idea, or fulfilled the promise which he made at the <lb/>
              close of the foregoing passage. And Bergk, although in his treatise 2 on <lb/>
              the Remains of the Old Comedy he was inclined to adopt the idea, yet <lb/>
              subsequently, in his Collection 3 of Aristophanic fragments, treated it as <lb/>
              altogether without foundation. To me it seems in the highest degree <lb/>
              improbable that the grammarians in question should have intentionally <lb/>
              cited the <foreign xml:lang="grc">Γεωργοὶ</foreign>, as Fritzsche supposes them to have done, under the <lb/>
              simple name of the Peace : I believe that it was by a mere unintentional <lb/>
              oversight that the six passages, which we have been considering, were <lb/>
              attributed to the Peace, and that the Peace from which they were supposed <lb/>
              to come was, in fact, the existing Comedy of that name. But I think it <lb/>
              not unlikely that Aristophanes did write a second Play on the same subject, <lb/>
              which was acted under the same name; but which, long before the time of <note type="footnote"> 1 The reader must understand that from Fritzsche's pen a compliment to Dindorf <lb/>
              is merely ironical. His usual language as regards Dindorf constantly transgresses <lb/>
              the limits of courteous criticism. Thus, in his note to Thesm. 225, complaining that <lb/>
              Dindorf had omitted line 273 of the Peace (" optimum senarium dummodo senten­ <lb/>

          <p>Little or nothing has been done, since the commencement of this <lb/>
            century, to assist in a right understanding of the Peace of Aristophanes. <lb/>
            The notes of Bothe and Richter, the only two editors who have <lb/>
            attempted at any length to explain it, are of very moderate value; and <lb/>
            we are still for all practical purposes left to the old commentaries of <lb/>
            Florent Chretien, Bergler, and Brunck. The Play has, however, largely <lb/>
            participated in the general improvement of the Aristophanic text, which <lb/>
            resulted from the collation of the Ravenna and Venetian MSS.</p>
          <p>In the present edition, the first complete edition of the Peace which <lb/>
            has ever been published by an Englishman, I have endeavoured to adhere <lb/>
            more closely than has hitherto been done to the reading of those two <lb/>
            excellent MSS. The various readings and conjectures are collected at <lb/>
            the end of the Play• whilst in the notes which are subjoined to the text, <lb/>
            I have attempted to bring out the purpose and meaning of the poet, to <lb/>
            illustrate the historical bearings of the Comedy, and to explain such <lb/>
            phrases and passages as seemed to require an explanation, carefully dis­ <lb/>
            tinguishing, in every instance, whatever I have borrowed from previous <lb/>
            writers. The translation, though generally literal, is not uniformly so: <lb/>
            it is designed to be readable as a whole, without reference to the original <lb/>
            Greek: and I have not hesitated to sacrifice strict verbal accuracy when­ <lb/>
            ever such a course seemed desirable for the carrying out of that primary <lb/>
            object. The translation retains the anapaestic, trochaic, and iambic <lb/>
            measures, the heroic hexameters, and the other familiar metres of the <lb/>
            original. And in one instance, vv. 775-818, I have endeavoured to <lb/>
            reproduce with exactness a more complicated Choral system, but the <lb/>
            attempt was not so successful as to encourage a repetition. <note type="footnote"> 3, OLD SQUARE, LINCOLN'S INN, <lb/>

            <title type="main">SUPPLEMENTARY NOTE TO THE PRESENT EDITION</title>
          </head>
          <p>IN 1866, when the first edition of this work was published, no Comedy <lb/>
            of Aristophanes had received less attention than the present; but during <lb/>
            the last half-century no Comedy has received more. Not only have there <lb/>
            been twelve editions published, eight by English, and four by foreign, <lb/>
            scholars; there have also been numerous separate dissertations and <lb/>
            discussions, principally on the subject of the machinery employed, <lb/>
            and the manner in which Trygaeus was transported from the earth <lb/>
            to the Palace of Zeus in heaven. On this subject some very strange <lb/>
            theories have been advanced. That Trygaeus was raised aloft by the <lb/>
            machine called the crane, <foreign xml:lang="grc">γέρανος</foreign>, is common ground. But one contends <lb/>
            that after ascending to a certain height he is brought down again to his <lb/>
            own house which has meanwhile been transformed into the house of Zeus. <lb/>
            Another conceives that the house of Trygaeus is represented at one end of <lb/>
            the stage, and the house of Zeus at the other, and that the crane lifts <lb/>
            him up from his own house, swings him through the air and drops him <lb/>
            at the house of Zeus. And others devise other equally strange and <lb/>
            wonderful theories. They all unite in ignoring the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐξώϭτρα</foreign>, a machine <lb/>
            which seems to play in this Comedy a very similar part to that which it <lb/>
            afterwards played in the Thesmophoriazusae. See the Commentary on <lb/>
            Thesm. 277. In the latter Play the scene at the opening is laid before <lb/>
            the house of Agathon, and so it continues until line 276 when by means <lb/>
            of the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐξώϭρα</foreign> the Thesmophorium is pushed forward, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὠθει̑ται</foreign> TO <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἱερὸν</foreign>, <lb/>
            and fills the entire stage, so that the house of Agathon with the original <lb/>
            scene is completely blotted out, and does not reappear throughout the <lb/>
            Play. Here the scene at the opening is laid before the house of Trygaeus <lb/>
            and so it continues until line 173 when, Trygaeus having been hoisted up <lb/>
            to a height sufficient for the action of the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐξώϭτρα</foreign>, a large platform is pushed <lb/>
            forward, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὠθει̑ται</foreign>, underneath him so that he and his beetle at once find <lb/>
             <pb n="xxxiii"/>
            themselves resting upon it. This platform fills the entire stage, so that <lb/>
            the house of Trygaeus with the original scene is completely blotted out, <lb/>
            and does not reappear until after the Parabasis, when by the action of <lb/>
            the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐξώϭτρα</foreign> the platform is drawn in again, and the original house and <lb/>
            scene become visible once more. The exclamation of Trygaeus to the <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">μηχανοποιὸς</foreign>, line 174, is occasioned by the action not of the crane, but of <lb/>
            the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐξώϭτρα</foreign>, the sudden protrusion of the great platform just underneath <lb/>
            him being enough to alarm the most courageous man and beetle. This <lb/>
            platform or upper stage, as it may be convenient to call it, is, as in the <lb/>
            Thesmophoriazusae, of exactly similar dimensions to the original or lower <lb/>
            stage, and has for its background the Palace of Zeus. Trygaeus and <lb/>
            his beetle therefore, so soon as they rest upon it, are immediately in front <lb/>
            of the Palace-doors, out of which come, first Hermes, and then War and <lb/>
            his attendant. Henceforth, until the Parabasis, the action of the Play <lb/>
            proceeds on this upper stage, and the original scene with the house of <lb/>
            Trygaeus is alike out of sight and out of mind. It is here that War is <lb/>
            preparing to pound all the Hellenic cities in his mighty mortar; here is <lb/>
            the pit into which Peace has been cast; and out of which the Chorus, <lb/>
            with the aid of Trygaeus and Hermes, at length succeed in bringing her <lb/>
            once more to sight. The Chorus is composed exclusively of Attic <lb/>
            (possibly even of Athmonian) farmers; for the notion that the Argives, <lb/>
            Boeotians, Megarians, and Lamachus who are in turn upbraided for not <lb/>
            giving due assistance to the work are actually represented in the theatre, <lb/>
            either as forming part of the Chorus or as supernumeraries, is altogether <lb/>
            fanciful and inadmissible. These farmers must pull by means of ropes <lb/>
            falling from the upper stage to the orchestra, if indeed they really pull at <lb/>
            all and are not rather here, as elsewhere, substituting for real action mere <lb/>
            dancing and gesticulation in the orchestra 1- But somehow or other Peace <note type="footnote"> 1 Owing to our ignorance of the internal arrangements of the Athenian theatre, <lb/>
            it is impossible to explain satisfactorily the term <foreign xml:lang="grc">εἰϭιόντες</foreign> in line 427. But when <lb/>
            we remember that the dances in the orchestra are taken as representing and as <lb/>
            equivalent to-in the Thesmophoriazusae, the careful peregrinations of the women, <lb/>
            up and down, through every tier of the auditorium, and-in the Frogs, the march </note> <note type="footnote"> PEACE </note> <note type="footnote"> c </note> <lb/>

            reappears, accompanied by her two handmaidens, Harvesthome and <lb/>
            Mayfair. The two handmaidens are represented by Choregic actors, and <lb/>
            just as the Parabasis is about to commence they depart with Trygaeus by <lb/>
            the masked staircase into the interior of the theatre, reappearing with <lb/>
            him, when the Parabasis is over, on the lower stage. It must be <lb/>
            remembered that Trygaeus does not descend directly from the upper to <lb/>
            the lower stage; it would indeed have been impossible for him to do so. <lb/>
            Peace is not represented by any actor; she is merely a colossal statue, and <lb/>
            it seems as though only her head and bust1 appear above the upper stage. <lb/>
            No remarks are made upon her person as upon those of Harvesthome and <lb/>
            Mayfair; and her lips could not have approached the ear of Hermes had <lb/>
            she and he been standing on the same level. Trygaeus had ascended from <lb/>
            the lower to the upper stage by means of his beetle, and it is no wonder <lb/>
            that he cannot tell how he is to descend again; but instructed by Hermes, <lb/>
            he finds a staircase which takes him into the interior of the theatre, <lb/>
            behind the scenes.</p>
          <p>Speaking generally, the actors confine themselves to the stage, and the <lb/>
            Chorus to the orchestra. But in the preceding Comedy, the Wasps, <lb/>
            Aristophanes did what no man had ever done before (<foreign xml:lang="grc">του̑το οὐδείς πω πάρος <lb/>
            δέδρακεν</foreign>) by making his protagonist descend into the orchestra, and lead <lb/>
            out the Chorus, dancing, at the ending of the Play." And in the present <lb/>
            Comedy he seems to have introduced the converse novelty by making the <note type="footnote"> of the Iacchus-procession from the Temple in Athens to and beyond the Cephisus, <lb/>
            it seems most probable that here too they were taken as representing and as <lb/>
            equivalent to the actual labour of hauling up the Goddess. </note><note type="footnote"> 1 I suspect that this was in reality all that there was of her. She does not seem <lb/>
            to have appeared again after the Parabasis. It is true that the word <foreign xml:lang="grc">ταύτην</foreign> in line <lb/>
            923 may seem to imply her presence ; but this may have been explained by a gesture. <lb/>
            When Trygaeus re-enters with Harvesthome and Mayfair, the servant though full <lb/>
            of curiosity about them makes no allusion to the statue of Peace which, if present, <lb/>
            must have been a far more conspicuous object; and had such a statue been visible <lb/>
            during the dedication festivities, Hierocles must have known at once who was the <lb/>
            object of worship, and could not have put the question <foreign xml:lang="grc">τίς ἡ θυϭία ποθ' αὑτηὶ καὶ τῳ <lb/>
            θεω̑ν</foreign> ; and again <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὅτῳ</foreign> Of <foreign xml:lang="grc">θύετ' οὐ φράσεθ</foreign>'; </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="xxxv"/>
            Chorus ascend to the stage and carry out the protagonist and his bride at <lb/>
            the ending of the Play. One Semichorus seems to have left the orchestra <lb/>
            after line 1316, and to reappear after line 1328 carrying Harvesthome <lb/>
            from the house into which she had entered (after line 855) for the purpose <lb/>
            of taking her bridal-bath. The other after line 1340 climbs up to the <lb/>
            stage and raises Trygaeus aloft, the two processions finally leaving the <lb/>
            theatre side by side for the nuptial festivities.</p>
          <p>I observed in the original Introduction that the Play abounded with <lb/>
            genuine kindly Panhellenic sentiments, occasionally rising, amidst all the <lb/>
            burlesque with which they are surrounded, into a strain of almost solemn <lb/>
            and pathetic dignity, as in that beautiful address to Peace which may be <lb/>
            called the Consecration Hymn." But this point is brought out more <lb/>
            fully and more clearly by Mr. Sharpley in the Introduction to his ex­ <lb/>
            cellent edition of the Peace, from which I take the liberty of borrowing <lb/>
            the remarks which follow :—</p>
          <p>" The poet makes it plain from the first that the mission of Trygaeus is undertaken <lb/>
            on behalf of all the Greeks, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὑπὲρ 'Ελλήνων πάντων</foreign> (93), '<foreign xml:lang="grc">Ελλήνων περὶ ἁπαξαπντων</foreign> <lb/>
            (105). Prayers for the future and regrets for the past alike have regard to Hellas, <lb/>
            not to Athens. Thus in line 435 we find <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BELL_08_fig15.jpg"/></figure> <lb/>
              in 1320 <figure type="illustration">

              and in 646 <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἡ δ' 'Ελλὰς</foreign> av I <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐξερημωθει̑ϭ' ἂν ὑμα̑ς ἔλαθε</foreign>. In line 292 when the Chorus <lb/>

              expressive and sentimental address <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὦ Πανέλληνες</foreign>-a word sadly rare in our extant <lb/>
              Greek literature. But the climax of lofty patriotism is reached in that wonderful <lb/>
              cry, <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BELL_08_fig17.jpg"/></figure> <lb/>
              -words which, in a different key, breathe the spirit of Panhellenism as nobly as <lb/>
              does the Aeschylean battle-cry at Salamis." <note type="footnote"> C 2 </note></p><pb n="xxxvi"/>
              
          <p>No poetical translation of the Peace had been published previously to <lb/>
            the year 1866; but since then we have had (1) a translation by Leonard <lb/>
            Hampson Rudd in 1867; (2) a translation of considerable parts of the <lb/>
            Play by the Right Honourable John Hookham Frere, published in 1872 <lb/>
            after Mr. Frere's death; and (3) a very lively and enjoyable translation <lb/>
            published in 1910 by Mr. R. F. Patterson.</p>
          <p>In the Commentary, as now arranged, the notes which are new are <lb/>
            distinguished from those which are old by being placed in brackets ( 〉1. <lb/>
            This has been done for several reasons:</p>
          <p>(1) Many remarks which were strictly accurate in 1866 would not be <lb/>
            accurate now. To take one example. It is stated in the note on line <lb/>
            153 that "all the Commentators" take <foreign xml:lang="grc">βουκολήϭι</foreign> in the sense of <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐξαπατήϭεται</foreign>. They had in fact all done so up to that time, but many <lb/>
            if not "most of the subsequent Commentators share the view put forward <lb/>
            in that note. It seemed therefore desirable to make it clear that the <lb/>
            statement in question belongs to the edition of 1866 and not to that of <lb/>
            1912.</p>
          <p>(2) Again, subsequent Commentators have frequently arrived at the <lb/>
            same conclusions as those which were advocated in the previous edition, <lb/>
            and have naturally expressed them in very similar language. I have <lb/>
            always tried to be scrupulously honest in acknowledging my obligations <lb/>
            to my predecessors, but if it were supposed that those conclusions were <lb/>
            advocated in this edition for the first time, I might seem to have borrowed <lb/>
            without acknowledgement from Commentaries which in reality were sub­ <lb/>
            sequent to my own.</p>
          <p>(3) Some of the remarks in the earlier edition have been very strangely, <lb/>
            though of course quite unintentionally, misstated. Here again I will give <lb/>
            one example. In my note on line 1014 <foreign xml:lang="grc">τα̑ς ἐν τεύτλοιϭι λοχευομένας</foreign> I said <lb/>
            " In the Medea of Melanthius, from which this and the preceding line are <lb/>
            borrowed, the phrase may have been <foreign xml:lang="grc">τα̑ς ἐν Κόλχοιϭι λοχευομένας</foreign>." That <lb/>
            is all. But Herwerden in his note on the passage after giving his own <note type="footnote">1 Of course many of the notes in brackets are merely the old notes altered. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="xxxvii"/>
            view proceeds to say "Postea vidi Rogersium conjecisse personatum <lb/>
            Creontem dixisse; <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀποχηρωθεὶς</foreign> ras <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐν Κόλχοιϭι λοχευομένας</foreign>. Sed enim <lb/>
            nec aptum foret participium praesens pro praeterito, nec Creon hercle <lb/>
            Medeam, quam ob interfectos et liberos et recens nuptam Creusam <lb/>
            pessime oderat, potuit desiderare." Herwerden mentions that he had <lb/>
            been unable to obtain my edition, and, apparently, his only knowledge of <lb/>
            it was derived from the friendly quotations in Mr. Paley's notes. But <lb/>
            neither in my notes nor in Paley's is there the slightest justification for <lb/>
            the remark that the words are conjectured to have been spoken by Creon. <lb/>
            It never occurred to me to consider who the speaker may have been, or <lb/>
            even what was the special subject of the " Medea " of Melanthius; it may <lb/>
            have turned on incidents totally distinct from those of the " Medea " of <lb/>
            Euripides, for there was more than one tragedy in the life of Medea. I <lb/>
            should not like it to be supposed that I made so ridiculous a suggestion <lb/>
            in the earlier edition and suppressed it in the present, possibly, it might <lb/>
            be conjectured, in consequence of Herwerden's criticism.</p>
          <p>The same distinction between what is old and what is new is made in <lb/>
            the notes to the first and second Greek Arguments; but it did not seem <lb/>
            necessary to extend it to the Appendix.</p>

          <p>The scene, at the opening of the Play, <lb/>
            represents the exterior of the house of <lb/>
            Trygaeus, two of whose servants are <lb/>
            visible in the foreground, ministering to <lb/>
            the wants of an enormous dung-beetle, <lb/>
            which is confined in one of the outer <lb/>
            courts, the walls of the court being sum­ <lb/>
            ciently high to conceal its inmate from <lb/>
            the audience. <foreign xml:lang="grc">Δύα δέ εἰσιν οἰκέται</foreign>, says <lb/>
            the Scholiast, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὧν ὁ μὲν τρέΦει τὸν κάνθαρον</foreign>, <lb/>
            o <foreign xml:lang="grc">δὲ ἔτερος μάττει</foreign>.And Dobree has re­ <lb/>
            distributed the opening dialogue, so as <lb/>
            to bring it into accordance with the view <lb/>
            that one servant prepares the food, the <lb/>
            other gives it to the beetle. But his <lb/>
            arrangement, though adopted with more <lb/>
            or less variation by all the recent editors, <lb/>
            is throughout forced and unsatisfactory. <lb/>
            And lines 23 (<foreign xml:lang="grc">κανθάρῳ μάττοντ</foreign>a <foreign xml:lang="grc">παρέχειν <lb/>
            έσθίειν</foreign>) and 27 (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἢν μὴ παραθῶ τρίψας</foreign>) seem <lb/>
            of themselves sufficient to show that no <lb/>
            such division of labour, as that which he <lb/>
            supposed the Scholiast to suggest, was <lb/>
            really intended by Aristophanes. The <lb/>
            whole manual work is performed by the <lb/>
            second servant; the first merely directs <lb/>
            and superintends the operation, as the <lb/>
            steward or confidential servant of Try­ <lb/>
            gaeus. In that capacity he remains <lb/>
            throughout the greater part of the Play <lb/>
            at his master's house, whilst the second <lb/>
            servant, after feeding the beetle, quits <lb/>
            the stage and is seen no more. I have <lb/>
            therefore, throughout the dialogue, re­ <lb/>
            stored the traditional arrangement, <lb/>
            which seems to me preferable in every <lb/>

            to what is passing at the time, but to <lb/>
            something that had been said a short time <lb/>
            previously. Thus, in the Republic, iv. <lb/>
            419 A ; v. 462 A; viii. 552 B, 559 0, D ; <lb/>
            ix. 592 A; x. 600 E, 609 C, &amp;c. ; and <lb/>
            similar examples might be collected from <lb/>
            almost any other of the Platonic dia­ <lb/>
            logues. In the Gorgias, 451 A, <foreign xml:lang="grc">νῦν δὴ</foreign> <lb/>
            and <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἅρτι</foreign> are used in the same passage <lb/>
            indiscriminately with reference to the <lb/>
            same point of time. Suidas (sub voc.) <lb/>
            cites a line of Magnes, in which the <lb/>
            force of the <foreign xml:lang="grc">δὴ</foreign> is very plainly brought <lb/>

            he did with regard to those of the flea in <lb/>
            the Clouds, 150. There is in Wood's <lb/>
            Natural History, iii. 468, a pleasantly <lb/>
            written sketch of the modus operandi of <lb/>
            certain of these dung-beetles, from which <lb/>
            it would seem that the dual is not alto­ <lb/>
            gether misapplied in describing the <lb/>
            manner in which they roll the substance <lb/>
            which is at once their food, their resi­ <lb/>
            dence, and their nest. "Every one <lb/>
            who has walked in the fields must have <lb/>
            noticed the singular rapidity with which <note type="footnote"> B 3 </note> <pb n="4"/>

              patches of cowdung disappear, and many <lb/>
              may have observed that this phenomenon <lb/>
              is caused by the efforts of sundry beetles <lb/>
              which burrow beneath the mass, and <lb/>
              convey the substance deep into the <lb/>
              ground. The common watchman-beetle <lb/>
              (Geotrupes stercorarius), so well known <lb/>
              from its habit of flying on droning wings <lb/>
              in the evening, is one of these valuable <lb/>
              beetles; and it is worthy of notice that, <lb/>
              despite the nature of the substance in <lb/>
              which they work, not a speck adheres to <lb/>
              their bright and polished armour. The <lb/>
              Egyptian beetle (Scarabaeus sacer) <lb/>
              employs a similar substance for the <lb/>
              cradle of its future young, kneading it <lb/>
              into irregular balls, in which it deposits <lb/>
              its eggs, and then rolling it away by <lb/>
              means of its odd-looking hind legs. After <lb/>
              it has made the ball, which is often larger <lb/>
              than itself, the beetle sets to work to <lb/>
              roll it to a convenient spot where the <lb/>
              earth is soft, and performs this curious <lb/>
              operation by a retrograde motion, the <lb/>
              hind legs directing the ball, while the <lb/>
              four other legs are employed in locomo­ <lb/>
              tion. During this operation the beetle <lb/>
              seems to be standing on its head, the <lb/>
              hind legs being much elevated, in order <lb/>
              to guide the ball, which by dint of much <lb/>
              rolling becomes nearly spherical. A <lb/>
              tolerably deep hole is then excavated in <lb/>
              a suitable spot, the ball rolled into it, <lb/>
              and the earth filled in. Many beetles <lb/>
              perform this useful operation, and in <lb/>
              several European countries, where the <lb/>
              beauty of the climate is only equalled <lb/>
              by the uncleanliness of the inhabitants, <lb/>
              these beetles are of inestimable service." <lb/>
              A similar account is given in Kirby and <lb/>
              Spence's Entomology, Letter ix; and <lb/>

            its sense of filth) " sufficiently for the <lb/>

            strangely have misread the observations <lb/>

            But I think that the interpretation of <lb/>
            the Scholiast—<foreign xml:lang="grc">ὑπερέχειν ἀντὶ τοῦ ἀντέχειν</foreign> <lb/>
            Kat <foreign xml:lang="grc">περιγίνεσθαι τῆς ὀσμῆς</foreign>-is on the whole <lb/>
            the preferable one, and that the meaning <lb/>
            simply is that, as in a sinking ship the <lb/>
            bilgewater gets the mastery over the <lb/>
            sailors, so here the stench is too strong for, <lb/>

            ence to its original signification. Thus <lb/>
            in Menander's Samia 348 (ed. Capps) <lb/>
            (where it is said of a hotheaded fellow <lb/>

            dainty made in a variety of ways, Photius <lb/>
            1. c.; Athenaeus xii. 12. It was a sort of <lb/>
            rich porridge, strengthened with boiled <lb/>

            the like. Trygaeus, for <foreign xml:lang="grc">κάνδαυλος</foreign>, pro­ <lb/>
            poses to substitute <foreign xml:lang="grc">κόνδυλος</foreign>, knuckle­ <lb/>

          <p>126. <foreign xml:lang="grc">πτηνὸς πορεύσει</foreign>] (The Scholiast <lb/>
            quotes some lines from the Stheneboea <lb/>
            of Euripides, which appear to end with <lb/>
            these words, though it is just possible <lb/>
            that they may form no part of the quota­ <lb/>
            tion. If they do form a part of it, there <lb/>
            is great force in Wagner's suggestion <lb/>
            (Stheneboea Frag. 5) that the whole of <lb/>
            the present line is borrowed from that <lb/>
            Tragedy; <foreign xml:lang="grc">ναυσθλοῦσθαι</foreign>, acorrupt form of <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ναυστολεῖσθαι</foreign>, being rather a favourite <lb/>
            word of Euripides.)</p>
          <p>129. <foreign xml:lang="grc">Αἰσώπου</foreign>] The Scholiast explains <lb/>
            the fable thus : The eagle had carried off <lb/>
            the young beetles; thereupon the old <lb/>
            beetle got into the eagle's eyry, and <lb/>
            pushed out her eggs. The eagle flew to <lb/>
            complain to Zeus, who bade her build <lb/>
            her nest in his own bosom. But, when <note type="footnote"> C </note> <pb n="18"/>

              <graphic url="ENG_BELL_08_fig51.jpg"/></figure> <lb/>
              the eagle had laid her eggs there, the <lb/>
              beetle flew buzzing about the ears of <lb/>
              Zeus ; and he, springing up to scare it <lb/>
              away, dropped and broke the eggs. The <lb/>
              moral, says the Scholiast, is that there is <lb/>
              no rest for the wicked, no, not even in <lb/>
              the bosom of Zeus. It is said that the <lb/>
              apologue was told by Aesop to the <lb/>
              Delphians, as they were about to put <lb/>
              him to death on a false charge of theft; <lb/>
              his motive being to warn them that <lb/>
              though he might be mean as the beetle, <lb/>
              and they exalted as the eagle, yet his <lb/>
              blood might ascend to heaven, and cry <lb/>
              for vengeance upon his murderers. This, <lb/>
              too, is the fable which Philocleon endea­ <lb/>
              vours to edge in, as he is being carried <lb/>
              shrieking from the stage.-Wasps <lb/>
              1446-8. See the Scholiasts there, and <lb/>
              see Lys. 695. It is versified by Spenser <lb/>
              in his fourth Sonnet on the World's <lb/>
              Vanity, and illustrated by Erasmus in <lb/>
              his celebrated Adage (to which Bergler <lb/>
              refers) Scarabaeus aquilam quaerit, which <lb/>
              is found in vol. ii, p. 686 of the Leyden <lb/>
              edition of his works, and of which the <lb/>
              most pointed and bitter passages are <lb/>
              translated in Hallam's Literature, chap. <lb/>
              iv. 〈It was this fable too which (in <lb/>
              Lucian's Icaro-menippus) inspired Me­ <lb/>
              nippus to soar on eagle and vulture wings <lb/>
              to heaven ; and to him also, as to Try­ <lb/>
              gaeus here, the gate, when he knocks at <lb/>
              it, is opened by Hermes as the lackey of <lb/>
              Zeus.) As the beetle merely followed the <lb/>
              eagle to heaven, it is difficult to see with <lb/>
              what propriety it is termed <foreign xml:lang="grc">μόνος πετεινῶν <lb/>

            are borrowed, as Bergler observes, from <lb/>
            Eurip. Iph. Taur. 1293. They are very <lb/>
            appropriate here; for <foreign xml:lang="grc">μῦθος</foreign> is a term more <lb/>
            applicable even than <foreign xml:lang="grc">λόγος</foreign> to an Aesopian <lb/>
            fable. In the Phaedo, 61B, Socrates says <pb n="19"/>
             </p>
          <p>So Aesop says, that ever reached the Gods.</p>
          <p>GIRL. 0 father, father, that's too good a story <lb/>
            That such a stinking brute should enter heaven !</p>
          <p>TRYG. It went to take revenge upon the eagle, <lb/>
            And break her eggs, a many years ago.</p>
          <p>GIRL. But should you not have harnessed Pegasus, <lb/>
            And so, in tragic style, approach the Gods ?</p>
          <p>TRYG. Nay, then I must have had supplies for two; <lb/>
            But now the very food I eat myself, <lb/>
            All this will presently be food for him.</p>
          <p>GIRL. What if he fall in wintry watery waves, <lb/>
            How will his wings help extricate him then ?</p>
          <p>TRYG. Oh, I've a rudder all prepared for that: <lb/>
            My ship's a beetle-sloop, of Naxian make.</p>
          <p>that he had, during his confinement in <lb/>
            the Athenian prison, turned into verse <lb/>
            the <foreign xml:lang="grc">μῦθοι</foreign> of Aesop, because he wished <lb/>
            before his death to act in obedience to <lb/>
            a heavenly vision, which often in his <lb/>
            past life had enjoined him <foreign xml:lang="grc">μουσικὴν ποιεῖν</foreign>, <lb/>
            and it seemed a poet's business <foreign xml:lang="grc">ποιεῖν <lb/>
            μύθους, ἀλλ᾿ οὐ λόγους</foreign>. (Here both words <lb/>
            are used of Aesop's fables, but more <lb/>
            frequently they are contrasted, <foreign xml:lang="grc">μυ̂θος</foreign> <lb/>
            being taken to mean a fiction and <foreign xml:lang="grc">λόγος</foreign> <lb/>
            a fact. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ο̂ν σὺ μὲν ἡγήσει μῦθον</foreign>, as <lb/>

          <p>Scholiast. That <foreign xml:lang="grc">κάνθαρος</foreign> is the name of <lb/>
            a particular kind of ship, says Athenaeus, <lb/>
            xi. 47, is <foreign xml:lang="grc">κοινὸν</foreign>, matter of common <lb/>
            notoriety. And in the next chapter he <lb/>
            cites several passages which illustrate <lb/>
            this and other meanings of the word. <lb/>
            (The name was probably given to the <lb/>
            vessel from something in its shape and <lb/>
            appearance which made it, with the oars <lb/>
            reaching out on each side, bear a certain <lb/>
            resemblance to a monstrous beetle. It <lb/>
            seems to have been originally invented <lb/>
            at Naxos, which had a large seafaring <lb/>
            population, and, in early times, many <lb/>
            ships of war (<foreign xml:lang="grc">πλοῖα μακρὰ πολλὰ</foreign>, Hdt. v. <lb/>
            30). And very probably, even when <lb/>

              line we must, I suppose, accept the <lb/>
              Scholiast's interpretation, <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸ αἰδοῖον <lb/>
              δείκνυσι</foreign>, that is the penem scorteum.</p>
          <p>145. <foreign xml:lang="grc">Πειραεῑ</foreign>] Peiraeus, says Thucy­ <lb/>
            dides, i. 93, is possessed of <foreign xml:lang="grc">λιμένας τρεῖς <lb/>
            αὐτοφυεῖς</foreign>. Of these, one was called, as <lb/>
            the Scholiast here informs us, Cantharus, <lb/>
            from a traditionary hero of that name. <lb/>
            Another, he says, was called Aphro­ <lb/>
            disium, and we learn from Hesychius <lb/>
            and other authorities that the name of <lb/>
            the third was Zea. And see Colonel <lb/>
            Leake's Topography of Athens, i. 373.</p>
          <p>147. <foreign xml:lang="grc">χωλός</foreign>] Not only was Euripides <lb/>
            noted as a <foreign xml:lang="grc">χωλοποιὸς</foreign>, an introducer of <lb/>
            maimed and limping heroes, in general, <lb/>
            see Acharnians and Frogs, passim ; but <lb/>
            one of his most celebrated representa­ <lb/>
            tions in that line was Bellerophon lamed <lb/>
            by a fall from Pegasus, Ach. 427. And <lb/>
            as the whole of this beetle-flight is a sort <lb/>
            of travestie of the Bellerophon of Euri­ <lb/>

            different from the present. And even <lb/>
            were authority produced to show (1) that <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">βαυκολεῖν</foreign>, standing alone, can mean <lb/>
            "to deceive a person" ; and (2) that <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">βουκαλήσομαι</foreign> can be employed in a purely <lb/>
            active signification (as to both of which <lb/>
            points I must, in the absence of authority, <lb/>
            entertain great doubt), yet the ordinary <lb/>
            meaning of the word, "to feed oneself," <lb/>
            " to turn to graze," seems to me not only <lb/>
            preferable, but absolutely required by <lb/>
            the context. The <foreign xml:lang="grc">με</foreign> is to be joined, not <lb/>
            with <foreign xml:lang="grc">βουκαλήσεται</foreign>, but with <foreign xml:lang="grc">ῥίψας</foreign>.</p>

            the Bellerophon, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἴθι χρυσαχάλιν᾽ αἴρων <lb/>
            πτέρυγας</foreign>. Euripides therefore applied <lb/>

            (ix. 20) and Xenophon (Cyr. i. 3. 3). <lb/>
            And so St. Chrysostom (Horn. xxi in <lb/>

            Aeschylean licence that Aristophanes <lb/>

            as applied to a horse's ears, is susceptible <lb/>
            of two very different significations : (1), <lb/>
            from the idea of brightness, quickness, <lb/>
            alertness, attached to the word, <foreign xml:lang="grc">φαιδροῖς <lb/>
            ὠσὶ</foreign> may mean arrectis auribus, micans <lb/>
            auribus; (2), from its sense of placid, <lb/>
            beaming, sleek good nature, it may mean <lb/>
            blandis auribus. Every commentator <lb/>
            adopts the former interpretation ; the <lb/>

              my opinion the Scholiast is quite right; <lb/>
              and Trygaeus is desiring in his steed <lb/>
              a sign not of spirit, but of good temper. <lb/>
              These lines and those which follow (159- <lb/>
              61) seem borrowed from the Bellero­ <lb/>
              phon of Euripides, probably from the <lb/>
              same monody which Philocleon quotes in <lb/>
              Wasps 757, &amp;c. In fact the chief humour <lb/>
              of these anapaests consists in the inter- <lb/>
              mixture by Trygaeus of snatches from <lb/>
              that tragedy with ejaculations supposed <lb/>
              to be wrung from him by the imminent <lb/>
              danger of his own situation.</p>

              which lead to the interior of the theatre. <lb/>
              Trygaeus dismounts, and shouts to the <lb/>

            is aware of the presence of man. He <lb/>
            appeals to Heracles, because the great <lb/>

            never a very formidable personage, and <lb/>
            who was always open to a bribe. Try­ <lb/>

          <p>HERM. Because, though They were oftentimes for Peace, <lb/>

            Or if the Attics had their turn of luck, <lb/>
            And the Laconians came to treat for peace, <lb/>

          <p>TRYG. Yes; that's exactly how we talked : exactly.</p>

            of the misfortunes which, unless averted <lb/>
            by the return of Peace, would fall upon <lb/>
            the Hellenic world. If there is any <lb/>

            the troubles which, notwithstanding the <lb/>
            general pacification of B. c. 424, were just <lb/>
            recommencing in Sicily (Thuc. v. 4), But <lb/>
            I believe that the poet is not referring <lb/>
            to any historical fact at all; he is merely <lb/>
            selecting, from the area over which the <lb/>
            war extended, such cities as most aptly <lb/>

          <p>252. TO PEAL <foreign xml:lang="grc">τἀττικόν</foreign>] The honey of <lb/>
            Attica was proverbial for its excellence. <lb/>
            " Sweet as Attic honey " is the passion­ <lb/>
            ate encomium bestowed by the Scythian <lb/>
            in Thesm. 1192, upon the maiden's kiss. <lb/>
            Nor has it altogether lost its pre-emi­ <lb/>
            nence, even in modern days. The <lb/>
            ‟murmuring of innumerable bees is <lb/>
            still heard amongst the fragrant thyme <lb/>
            of " sweet Hymettus " ; and no honey <lb/>
            is esteemed of so exquisite a flavour <lb/>
            as that which is there produced. Sir <lb/>
            George Wheler, who visited Attica <lb/>
            about A.D. 1676, and who gives in the <lb/>
            sixth book of his Travels a detailed <lb/>
            account of the processes adopted by the <lb/>
            Hymettian bee-keepers, describes their <lb/>
            honey as of a good consistence, and of a <lb/>
            fair gold colour. He says that " the <lb/>
            same quantity sweetens more water than <lb/>
            the like quantity of any other doth " ; <lb/>
            and that it is in such request, and fetches <lb/>
            so high a price in Constantinople, where <lb/>
            it is used for the purpose of sweetening <lb/>
            sherbet, that all the honey in the neigh­ <lb/>
            bourhood of Hymettus is brought to be <lb/>
            stamped with the mark of a monastery <lb/>
            there, that it may pass as the genuine <lb/>
            Hymettian honey. See also the second <lb/>
            letter of Mr. Brace bridge in the Ap­ <lb/>
            pendix to Wordsworth's Athens and <lb/>
            Attica. The Scholiasts observe how <lb/>
            tender the poet shows himself towards <lb/>
            Athens. She is the sweetest of all the <lb/>
            ingredients, and the demon of War has <lb/>
            no threats for her. (I will add a few <lb/>
            more tributes to the excellence of <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸ <lb/>
            μέλι τἀττικόν</foreign>. Strabo (ix. 1. 23, p. 399) <lb/>
            says <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὁ</foreign> ‛<foreign xml:lang="grc">Υμηττὸς μέλι ἄριστον</foreign>notet. And <lb/>
            a few lines later, <foreign xml:lang="grc">το̑ μέλιτος ἀρίστονὂντος <lb/>
            τω̑ν πάντωντου̑</foreign> ’<foreign xml:lang="grc">Αττικου̑</foreign>. Pliny (N. H. <lb/>
            xxi. 31, cf. Id. xi. 13) tells us that all the <lb/>
            world gave the highest praise to the Attic <lb/>
            honey ; and that as its special flavour <lb/>
            was supposed to be derived from the <lb/>
            thyme on which the bees were accus­ <lb/>
            tomed to browse, many have carried the <lb/>
            Attic thyme into other lands, and sought</p><pb n="35"/>
            
          <p>WAR. And now I'll pour some Attic honey in.</p>
          <p>TRYG. Hey, there, I warn you, use some other honey : <lb/>
            Be sparing of the Attic ; that costs sixpence.</p>
          <p>WAit. Ho, boy ! boy! Riot! RIOT. What's your will ?</p>
          <p>WAR. You'll catch it, <lb/>
            Y ou rascal, standing idle there! take that!</p>
          <p>RIOT. Ugh how it stings. 0 me! 0 me! why, master, <lb/>
            Sure you've not primed your knuckles with the garlic ?</p>
          <p>WAR. Run in and get a pestle. RIOT. We've not got one; <lb/>
            We only moved in yesterday, you know.</p>
          <p>WAit. Then ruu at once and borrow one from Athens.</p>
          <p>RIOT. I'll run by Zeus; or else I'm sure to catch it.</p>
          <p>to rear it there, but without success. <lb/>
            According to Plutarch (Dion. 58) it was <lb/>
            commonly said that the very best and the <lb/>
            very worst men came from Athens, just <lb/>
            as her soil produced the most delicious <lb/>
            honey and the deadliest hemlock. And <lb/>
            Synesius, in his 136th epistle, complains <lb/>
            that Athens, which aforetime was the <lb/>
            home of philosophers, now relies for her <lb/>
            celebrity on her honey-factors. " And <lb/>
            still its honeyed wealth Hymettus <lb/>
            yields," Childe Harold ii. 87.)</p>
          <p>255. <foreign xml:lang="grc">κλαύσει μακρά</foreign>] ("Plorabis largi­ <lb/>
            ter," Bergler. This is a favourite phrase <lb/>
            with Aristophanes who uses it, or an <lb/>
            equivalent, in every extant Comedy with <lb/>
            the single exception of the Acharnians. <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">μακρὰ</foreign> is <foreign xml:lang="grc">μακρὸν χρόνον</foreign>. It cannot bear <lb/>
            the meaning which Van Leeuwen gives <lb/>
            it, "clamores qui procul audiantur." <lb/>
            Menander in his <foreign xml:lang="grc">Περικειρομένη</foreign> (line 250, <lb/>
            ed. Capps) has <foreign xml:lang="grc">οἰμώζειν μακρὰ καὶ μεγάλ</foreign> a, <lb/>
            loud and long. Lucian couples it with <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">χαίρειν</foreign>, " Apology for the De Mercede <lb/>
            conductis" (5), "Pro lapsu inter salu­ <lb/>
            tandum " (2).)</p>
          <p>261. reap <foreign xml:lang="grc">Ἀθηναίων</foreign>] Here again the <lb/>
            Scholiast, perhaps rather fancifully, de­ <lb/>
            tects a possible compliment to the anti­ <lb/>
            quity of the Athenians, as if it was <lb/>
            intended to contrast them with these <lb/>
            new-comers, who " only moved in <lb/>
            yesterday." The two pestles of War are, <lb/>
            of course, Cleon and Brasidas ; of whom <lb/>
            Thucydides (v. 16) also says that they <lb/>
            were the most determined opponents of <lb/>
            Peace : Cleon, because in quiet times his <lb/>
            malpractices would be more apparent, <lb/>
            and his calumnies less easily believed : <lb/>
            Brasidas, because he was then in the <lb/>
            full tide of his glorious and successful <lb/>
            career." They both fell in the battle <lb/>
            which was fought under the walls of <lb/>
            Amphipolis, in the summer preceding <lb/>
            the performance of this Play. Cleon is <lb/>
            also called a pestle—<foreign xml:lang="grc">δοῖδυξ</foreign>—in Knights <lb/>

            is used by Xenophon, Mem. ii. 3. 16.</p>
          <p>268. <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸ δεῖνα</foreign>] This expression has <lb/>
            proved a great stumbling-block to the <lb/>
            commentators. Bergler's translation is <lb/>
            illud enim periit pistillum, and with this <lb/>
            Dindorf and Holden agree. Reiske takes <lb/>
            it to mean <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὰ δεῖνά ἐστιν εἰπεῖν</foreign> soil. <foreign xml:lang="grc">οἴμοι</foreign>. <lb/>
            Weise in a long note labours to prove <lb/>
            that it always means ille quisquis, and <lb/>
            is here to be joined with <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἁλετρίβανος</foreign>: <lb/>
            whilst Richter supplies <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐγένετο</foreign>,—<foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐ Φέρω</foreign>, <lb/>
            TO <foreign xml:lang="grc">δεῖνα γὰρ ἐγένετο</foreign>. I entirely agree with <lb/>
            Brunck (at Lysist. 921) that it is a mere <lb/>
            ejaculation, not grammatically con­ <lb/>
            nected with the rest of the sentence, <lb/>
            though even Brunck, as I think, to some <lb/>
            extent misapprehends the nature and <lb/>
            purport of the ejaculation. It is, in my <lb/>
            judgement, used here and info 879; <lb/>
            Birds 648 ; Lysist. 921, 926, 1168 ; as <lb/>
            a sort of apologetic and deprecatory intro­ <lb/>
            duction to a disagreeable narrative; a sort <lb/>
            of pretended forgetfulness or hesitation <lb/>
            (like our " What was I going to say?" <lb/>
            " What do you think?” " Would you <lb/>
            believe it? ") introduced for the purpose of <lb/>
            postponing or breaking the abruptness of a <lb/>
            statement which the speaker is reluctant <lb/>
            to make. It is thus closely connected with <lb/>
            the common use of <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὁ ἡ</foreign> TO <foreign xml:lang="grc">δεῖνα</foreign> to signify <lb/>
            a person or object whose name you do <lb/>
            not know or will not mention (Thesm. <lb/>
            620-5; Ach. 1149). And this I take to <lb/>
            be the interpretation of the Scholiast, <lb/>

            Just see how terrible our danger is: <lb/>
            For if that varlet bring a pestle back, <lb/>
            War will sit down and pulverize our cities. <lb/>
            Heavens ! may he perish, and not bring one back.</p>

              tary on Lys. 921, and the introduction to <lb/>
              the Plutus, p. xxv. I have altered the <lb/>
              distribution of the speeches in this line <lb/>
              which generally runs no. <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὗτος</foreign>. KY. <foreign xml:lang="grc">τί <lb/>
              ἔστιν</foreign> ; no. <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐ Φέρεις</foreign> ; It seems to me that <lb/>
              when Riot returns, War could not begin <lb/>
              with <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὗτος</foreign>, nor could Riot reply with <lb/>
              <foreign xml:lang="grc">τί ἔστιν</foreign>; As I have arranged the line it <lb/>
              exactly corresponds with the second <lb/>
              entrance of Riot infra 280, 281. Riot <lb/>
              begins, and War answers here <foreign xml:lang="grc">τί ἔστιν; <lb/>

            the aspirate because I think that the <lb/>

            <foreign xml:lang="grc">διαστραΦῆναι</foreign>) “to be dislocated." But, <lb/>
            in my judgement, the words <foreign xml:lang="grc">τοῦ μετιόντος <lb/>

            " a pestle of war," that "he was advo­ <lb/>

            with Sparta, and the restoration of the <lb/>
            prisoners." See Grote's History of <lb/>

          <p>363. <foreign xml:lang="grc">Κιλλικῶν</foreign>] According to the <lb/>
            Scholiasts, Cillicon was a traitor who <lb/>
            delivered up his native country to its <lb/>
            enemies. (Some say Syrus to the Sa­ <lb/>
            mians ; others Miletus to the Prienians, <lb/>
            aud others otherwise.) His suspicious <lb/>
            movements had previously attracted ob­ <lb/>
            servation ; but whenever interrogated as <lb/>
            to his intentions, his reply was <foreign xml:lang="grc">πάντα <lb/>
            ὰγαθὰ</foreign>, all right. And Trygaeus means <lb/>
            that he is doing no harm, but <foreign xml:lang="grc">πάντα ἀγαθὰ</foreign>,</p><pb n="47"/>
            
          <p>Nor a judge so stubborn-hearted, unrelenting, and severe; <lb/>
            You shall find me yielding then, <lb/>
            Quite a tender youth again, <lb/>
            When these weary times depart. <lb/>
            Long enough we've undergone <lb/>
            Toils and sorrows many a one, <lb/>
            Worn and spent and sick at heart, <lb/>
            From Lyceum, to Lyceum, trudging on with shield and spear. <lb/>
            Now then tell us what you would <lb/>
            Have us do, and we'll obey, <lb/>
            Since by fortune fair and good <lb/>
            You're our sovereign Lord to-day.</p>
          <p>TRYG. Come let me see which way to move the stones.</p>
          <p>HERM. Rogue ! miscreant! what are you up to now ? TRYG. No harm; <lb/>
            Everything's right, as Cillicon observed.</p>
          <p>HERM. Wretch ! you shall die ! TRYG. When it's my lot, of course, <lb/>
            For being Hermes you'll use lots, I know.</p>
          <p>HERM. 0 you are doomed! doomed! doomed ! TRYG. Yes ? for what day ?</p>
          <p>HERM. This very instant. TRYG. But I'm not prepared : <lb/>
            I've bought no bread and cheese, as if to die.</p>
          <p>HERM. Ah, well, you're absolutely gone ! TRYG. That's odd</p>
          <p>like Cillicon.</p>
          <p>364. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἣν λάχω</foreign>] "It was," says the <lb/>
            Scholiast, "the general custom at Athens <lb/>
            to execute only one criminal a day ; and <lb/>
            when several were condemned to death, <lb/>
            the order in which they were led out to <lb/>
            execution was determined by lot." And <lb/>
            I think that Trygaeus simply means that <lb/>
            Hermes being the God of Chance, under <lb/>
            whose special patronage lots and lotteries <lb/>
            are, will of course follow the Athenian <lb/>
            custom, and decide the matter by lot. <lb/>
            He is merely bantering Hermes with a <lb/>
            series of ridiculous repartees. Brunck <lb/>
            would read <foreign xml:lang="grc">οἶδ</foreign>’ <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὅ, τι</foreign>, but <foreign xml:lang="grc">οἶδ</foreign>’ <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὅτιι</foreign>s placed <lb/>
            at the end of the sentence here, as in <lb/>
            Wasps 1348, Soph. Antig. 276, and in­ <lb/>
            numerable other places, in the sense of <lb/>
            " Well I know." And of. infra 373.</p>
          <p>368. <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὔτ</foreign>’<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἄλφιτ</foreign>’] This is explained to <lb/>
            mean, "I have bought no rations, as if <lb/>
            I was going to be killed "; " quasi unus <lb/>
            tantum modus," says Bergler, " sit pere­ <lb/>
            undi, aut certissimus in bellum ire."</p>
          <p>369. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπιτέτριψαι</foreign>] This word is used, <lb/>

              phanes, in the sense of being utterly de­ <lb/>
              stroyed ; and the answer of Trygaeus, <lb/>
              according to Bergler, turns upon the <lb/>
              idea expressed in Acharnians 757, that <lb/>
              so he would be out of his misery. But <lb/>
              probably he is only chaffing Hermes, as <lb/>
              before.</p>
          <p>375. <foreign xml:lang="grc">μυηθῆναι</foreign>] The Scholiast refers <lb/>
            to the sketch, given in the Frogs, of the <lb/>
            happy state to which those, who have <lb/>
            been initiated and have lived a holy life, <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὅσοι μεμυήμεθ</foreign>’ <foreign xml:lang="grc">εὺσεβῆ τε διήγομεν τρόπον</foreign> <lb/>
            (Frogs 456), will after death be trans­ <lb/>
            lated. They dwell in realms of fairest <lb/>
            sunshine and exhilarating brightness, <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">φῶς κάλλιστον</foreign> (155), <foreign xml:lang="grc">μόνοις</foreign> yap <foreign xml:lang="grc">ήμῖν ἥλιος <lb/>

            myrtle groves (156) and banks of roses <lb/>
            (448), while around them circle the dance <lb/>
            and song and the softly-breathing melo­ <lb/>
            dy of the flute (154), and all pure and <lb/>
            holy festivities proceed for ever in the <lb/>
            happy companies of the Blessed, <foreign xml:lang="grc">θιάσους <lb/>
            εὐδαίμονας</foreign> (156). And I may add (to <lb/>
            illustrate the mention by Trygaeus of the <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">χοιρίδιον</foreign>, whose sacrifice was an essential <lb/>
            part of the ceremony of initiation), that <lb/>
            Xanthias no sooner sees those holy and <lb/>
            happy bands in the world below, than <lb/>
            he calls out, vulgarly, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὡς ἡδύ μοι προσ­ <lb/>

          <p>376. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὦ</foreign> Z<foreign xml:lang="grc">εῦ</foreign>] Hermes, indignant at <lb/>
            this last sally, calls aloud to his Master. <lb/>
            Trygaeus endeavours to pacify him, yet <lb/>
            even now cannot resist a joke, for there <lb/>
            is an obvious play on the similarity of <lb/>
            sound between <foreign xml:lang="grc">πρὸς τῶν θεῶν</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">πρὸς <lb/>
            τῶν κρεῶν</foreign>. In reply, Hermes (like Iris <lb/>

            His statue was at every Athenian door, <lb/>

            is, in my judgement, unquestionably <lb/>
            right in referring these words to the <lb/>
            Spartan captives, who were then lan­ <lb/>
            guishing in the Athenian prison, " keep­ <lb/>

            denote the instrument employed for <lb/>
            confining prisoners, and is indeed so <lb/>
            used with reference to these very cap­ <lb/>
            tives in Knights 394. It was only the <lb/>
            longing desire of the Spartans to recove <lb/>
            these prisoners, <foreign xml:lang="grc">τ</foreign>0<foreign xml:lang="grc">οὺς ἂνδρας κομισασθαι</foreign> <lb/>

            so absorbing, that even the brilliant <lb/>
            successes of Brasiclas were welcomed <lb/>
            merely as a means to that end-which <lb/>
            was now bringing about the opportunity <lb/>

          <p>HERM. Ah, mark, 'tis only such as work in wood <lb/>

          <p>TRYG. Keep it up a little longer.</p>
          <p>HERM. Yo ho ! pull away.</p>
          <p>looked this circumstance in describing <lb/>
            the pacific inclination of the Laconians. <lb/>
            The ingenious theory of Paulmier (which <lb/>
            has been followed by Brunck, Bothe, <lb/>
            Richter, and others), that by ol <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐχόμενοι <lb/>
            του̃ ξύλου</foreign> we are to understand the <lb/>
            framers of agricultural implements, and <lb/>
            by <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὀ χαλκεὺς</foreign> the forger of military <lb/>
            weapons, would, I am persuaded, never <lb/>
            have been invented, but for his erroneous <lb/>
            belief that this Play was composed after <lb/>
            the release of the Sphacterian captives. <lb/>
            I doubt if there is, in reality, so sharp <lb/>
            a distinction between the interests of the <lb/>
            workers in wood and those of the workers <lb/>
            in metal, as his theory would imply. <lb/>
            And at all events it is, I think, clear that <lb/>
            Aristophanes is here referring to some­ <lb/>
            thing special in the circumstances of <lb/>
            Sparta, and not to any mere general <lb/>
            distinction between the warlike and un­ <lb/>
            warlike classes, which, if true at all, <lb/>
            would at any rate be no more true of <lb/>
            Sparta than it would of any other Hel­ <lb/>
            lenic State. The exact meaning of the <lb/>
            words o <foreign xml:lang="grc">χαλκεὺς οὐκ ἐᾷ</foreign> is, I think, more <lb/>
            doubtful: but, on the whole, it appears <lb/>
            probable that the Scholiast's explanation <lb/>
            is here again correct, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὂτι ἐδέδεντο καὶ <lb/>
            περιέκειντο αὐτοι̃ς πέδαι</foreign>. There can be no <lb/>
            allusion here (as Florent Chretien, re­ <lb/>

            ance of the war. Peace and the restora­ <lb/>
            tion of Nisaea were to them objects of <lb/>
            the most urgent necessity. Yet they <lb/>
            were at present holding back from, and <lb/>
            ultimately declined to accede to, the <lb/>
            Peace of Nicias, inasmuch as it allowed <lb/>
            Nisaea, without which peace itself was <lb/>
            valueless, to remain in the possession of <lb/>
            the Athenians.</p><pb n="62"/>

          <p>502. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ορόδοις</foreign>] The poet is alluding <lb/>
            to the circumstance that the Megarians <lb/>
            furnished the immediate cause of, or <lb/>
            excuse for, the Peloponnesian War. See <lb/>
            on 609 infra. And as the Megarid was <lb/>
            the great garlic-producing country (see <lb/>
            on 246 supr.), he expresses himself in <lb/>
            language borrowed from the custom of <lb/>
            priming gamecocks with garlic before <lb/>
            they commenced to fight. See Acharn. <lb/>
            166 ; Knights 494 ; and the Scholiasts <lb/>
            there. The term <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἠλεἰψατε</foreign>, however, is <lb/>
            rather derived from the wrestling-school, <lb/>
            where the trainer (hence called <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀλείπτης</foreign>) <lb/>
            anointed the intending combatants with <lb/>
            oil (see Knights 490); and it may have <lb/>
            been introduced here to give more point <lb/>
            to the idea expressed in Bergler's note, <lb/>
            " Loquitur de Pace, tanquam de puella <lb/>
            delicata, odorem allii aversante."</p>

            of course be considered as represented <lb/>

            Stop, stop, Athenians : shift your hold a little; <lb/>
            It's no use pulling as you're now disposed. <lb/>
            You don't do anything but go to law. <lb/>
            No, if you really want to pull her out,</p>
          <p>505. <foreign xml:lang="grc">δικάζετε</foreign>] We should, as the <lb/>
            Scholiast observes, have expected some <lb/>
            other word, ye do nothing but talk, or get <lb/>
            in the way; but Aristophanes rarely <lb/>
            misses an opportunity of twitting his <lb/>
            fellow countrymen with their litigious <lb/>
            propensities. The advice conveyed in <lb/>
            the two following lines is, no doubt, as <lb/>
            Bergler and Brunck remark, equivalent <lb/>
            to the celebrated political maxim of <lb/>
            Themistocles, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὂτιἀνθεκτέα τη̃ς θαλάσσης</foreign> <lb/>
            (Thuc. i. 93). Yet it is hard to see how <lb/>
            it would tell at this moment in favour of <lb/>
            peace, unless the poet means to imply <lb/>
            either that it was not the maritime <lb/>
            supremacy of Athens, but her attempt <lb/>
            to interfere, as a military power, in the <lb/>
            arrangements of Hellas Proper, which <lb/>
            first alarmed the jealousy of Sparta ; or <lb/>
            else that the recent disasters of her <lb/>
            armies at Delium and Amphipolis had <lb/>
            deprived her of the power, which the <lb/>
            victories of her fleets had previously <lb/>
            placed in her hands, of making peace <lb/>
            when, and almost as, she would. In this <lb/>
            case, too, the meaning of <foreign xml:lang="grc">δικάζετε</foreign> may <lb/>
            be, '' Ye should not have haggled like <lb/>

            tion of a line of Euripides preserved by <lb/>

            ἒχθιστον τέκος</foreign>. (The Scholiast says that <lb/>
            it comes either from the Telephus or the <lb/>

            Commentary there. Licymnius the <lb/>
            half-brother of Alcmene was, either <lb/>
            wilfully or accidentally, killed by Tie­ <lb/>

            the note there. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀπέπτυσα</foreign>, I abominate, <lb/>

            the commencement of a line, and some­ <lb/>
            times with, and sometimes without, an <lb/>
            accusative following—Hec. 1276, Hipp. <lb/>

            instead of '<foreign xml:lang="grc">Ακούετε λαοὶ</foreign> as the form used <lb/>

            of a picnic to which each guest contri­ <lb/>
            buted his share ; but that is not suitable <lb/>

            Next a little salt provision fit for country uses buy, <lb/>

            Right and tight, like rounded biscuits, or a thronged festivity.</p>
          <p>TRYG. Yes, by Zeus ! the well-armed mattock seems to sparkle as we gaze, <lb/>
            And the burnished pitchforks glitter in the sun's delighted rays. <lb/>
            Very famously with those will they clear the vineyard rows. <lb/>
            So that I myself am eager homeward to my farm to go, <lb/>
            Breaking up the little furrows (long-neglected) with the hoe. <lb/>
            Think of all the thousand pleasures,</p>
          <p>kindling, and is specially the epithet of <lb/>
            an eye. Athene is <foreign xml:lang="grc">γοργῶπιςι</foreign>n the <lb/>
            " Ajax." Both Aeschylus (Septem 532) <lb/>
            and Euripides (Phoen. 146) apply the <lb/>
            epithet to the eagle eye of the boyish <lb/>
            hero Parthenopaeus, the son of Atalanta, <lb/>
            and one of the Seven against Thebes. <lb/>
            Achilles Tatius uses it of a maiden's <lb/>
            quick clear-glancing eye, <foreign xml:lang="grc">γοργὸν ἐν ἡδονῇ</foreign> <lb/>

            not after that destruction, nor has the <lb/>

            point. It is only in line 624 that he <lb/>
            reaches the actual outbreak of the War. <lb/>
            Here he is speaking of something which <lb/>

          <p>Such a bitter smoke ascended while the flames of war he blew, <lb/>
            That from every eye in Hellas everywhere the tears it drew. <lb/>
            Wailed the vine, and rent its branches, when the evil news it heard; <lb/>
            Butt on butt was dashed and shivered, by revenge and anger stirred; <lb/>
            There was none to stay the tumult; Peace in silence disappeared.</p>
          <p>TRYG. By Apollo I had never heard these simple facts narrated, <lb/>

            Goodness me! how many things escape our notice I declare.</p>
          <p>HERM. Then when once the subject cities, over whom ye bare the sway, <lb/>
            Saw you at each other snarling, growling angrier day by day, <lb/>
            To escape the contributions, every willing nerve they strained,</p>
          <p>their teeth at each other. And the line <lb/>
            which follows shows that the poet con­ <lb/>
            templates these inanimate objects as <lb/>
            taking an active part in promoting the <lb/>
            confusion which he is here describing. <lb/>

            First City in a Free Confederacy, all <lb/>
            the members of which contributed alike <lb/>

            pugnant to Hellenic sentiments, that <lb/>
            Athens was universally regarded by <lb/>
            both friends and foes in the light of <lb/>
            a Tyrant city (Thuc. i. 122, 124, ii. 63, <lb/>
            iii. 37) ; and the avowed object of the <lb/>
            Peloponnesians in entering upon the <lb/>
            war was to put an end to what they <lb/>
            considered an unnatural usurpation, and <lb/>
            to leave every Hellenic city free. So <pb n="78"/>

              eager were the tributaries to shake off <lb/>
              the yoke, that, shortly before the Pelo­ <lb/>
              ponnesian War, we read of a whole <lb/>
              maritime population giving up their <lb/>
              homes and migrating inland, where it <lb/>
              was hoped that the arm of Athens could <lb/>
              not reach them (Thuc. i. 58). Thucy­ <lb/>
              dides does not actually mention that <lb/>
              they employed bribes to induce the <lb/>
              Spartans to commence the war ; but he <lb/>
              tells us (i. 58) that the Potidaeans, whom <lb/>
              he calls <foreign xml:lang="grc">ξυμμάχους φάρου ὑποτελει̑̂ς</foreign> of <lb/>
              Athens, managed matters so well at <lb/>
              Sparta, that they obtained from the <lb/>
              highest Lacedaemonians a promise that, <lb/>
              if the Athenians touched Potidaea, the <lb/>
              Spartan armies should be led into Attica.</p>
          <p>623. <foreign xml:lang="grc">αἰσχροκερδει̂ς καὶ διειρωνάξεναι</foreign>] <lb/>
            Bergler refers to Eurip. Androm. 451, <lb/>
            where Andromache, appealing to the <lb/>
            candour of the Spartans, asks, " Are <lb/>
            ye not <foreign xml:lang="grc">αἰσχροκερδει̂ς</foreign> ?" The epithet <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">διειρωνάξενοι</foreign> is supposed to allude to the <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ξενηλασια</foreign> of Sparta. That that harsh <lb/>
            institution was keenly resented by the <lb/>
            other Hellenic states, may perhaps be <lb/>
            gathered from the reply dictated by <lb/>
            Pericles to the Spartan ultimatum, <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">Μεγαρέας ἐάσομεν ἀγορᾷ καὶ λιμέσι χρῆσθαι, <lb/>
            ἢν καὶ Αακεδαιμόνιοι ξενηλασίας μὴ ποιω̄σι <lb/>

            Thuc. i. 144.</p>
          <p>624. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀνήρπασαν</foreign>] For they refused <lb/>
            the offers of Athens to refer all matters <lb/>
            in dispute to arbitration, and acted upon <lb/>
            the advice of the Corinthians, <foreign xml:lang="grc">μὴ ὀκνεῖν <lb/>
            τὰν πάλεμαν ἀντ</foreign>’<foreign xml:lang="grc">εἰρήνης μεταλαμβάνειν</foreign> <lb/>
            (Thuc. i. 120). In after years, when the <lb/>
            fortunes of war had turned against them, <lb/>
            they acknowledged that they had been <lb/>
            too precipitate in commencing it (Thuc. <lb/>
            vii. 18).</p>
          <p>625. <foreign xml:lang="grc">τἀκείνων</foreign>] That is, of course, <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">τῶν μεγίστων</foreign>, not, as Richter explains it, <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">τῶν πολεμούντων</foreign>. Aristophanes is dis­ <lb/>
            tinguishing between the leading men <lb/>
            and the peasant-farmers of Laconia : the <lb/>
            former, he says, gained by the war, for <lb/>
            they were bribed to commence it; it <lb/>
            ruined the latter, for their lands were <lb/>
            ravaged by the Athenian forays. Peri­ <lb/>
            cles (Thuc. i. 142) calls the Pelopon­ <lb/>
            nesians in general <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἄνδρες γεωργαί</foreign>.</p>
          <p>626. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀντιτιμωρούμεναι</foreign>] Before the <lb/>
            war commenced, Pericles had laid it <lb/>
            down as a maxim of policy, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἢν ἐπὶ τὴν <lb/>

          <p>And the chief Laconian leaders by enormous bribes they gained. <lb/>
            These at once for filthy lucre, guest-deluders as they are, <lb/>
            Hustling out this gracious lady, greedily embraced the War. <lb/>
            But from this their own advantage ruin to their farmers came; <lb/>
            For from hence the eager galleys sailing forth with vengeful aim, <lb/>
            Swallowed up the figs of people who were not, perchance, to blame.</p>
          <p>TRYG. Very justly, very justly! richly had they earned the blow, <lb/>
            Lopping down the dusky fig-tree I had loved and nurtured so.</p>
          <p>accordingly it was while the Pelopon­ <lb/>
            nesians were yet in Attica on their first <lb/>
            invasion, and while the whole city was <lb/>
            in an uproar, as Mr. Mitford expresses <lb/>
            it, about the devastation of Acharnae, <lb/>
            that the Athenians sent out their first <lb/>
            retaliatory fleet to ravage the coasts of <lb/>
            Peloponnesus (Thuc. ii. 23). And thence­ <lb/>
            forward, in every succeeding year, even <lb/>
            after the Laconian invasions of Attica <lb/>
            had been stopped by the threat of exe­ <lb/>
            cuting the Sphacterian prisoners, the <lb/>
            Athenian triremes were constantly dart­ <lb/>

            Peloponnesus, revenging not upon the <lb/>
            Laconian leaders, but upon the Laconian <lb/>
            villagers, " who were not, perchance, to <lb/>
            blame," the damage which Attica had <lb/>
            sustained from the invading armies.</p>

            seen as well in the impressive language <lb/>
            of Thucydides (ii. 21) as from number­ <lb/>
            less passages in the extant plays of <lb/>
            Aristophanes. " Peace ! " say the <lb/>
            choleric Acharnians, in indignation <lb/>
            (Ach. 183), “what! when they have cut <lb/>

            Lacedaemonians with all my heart," <lb/>

            This phrase has been universally, and, <lb/>
            I think, very strangely, misinterpreted. <lb/>
            Nothing can be clearer than its mean­ <lb/>
            ing. Aristophanes has just shown that <lb/>
            the Laconian farmers had been sold by <lb/>
            their leaders, and now he adds, that the <lb/>
            Attic farmers, when they came flocking <lb/>
            in from all the villages to Athens, did <lb/>
            not observe that they too were being <lb/>
            sold by theirs, in just the same way, <lb/>
            i.e. "eodem modo quo Lacones." Yet <lb/>
            Bergler and Brunck translate it, “ eodem <lb/>
            modo quo urbani"; Bothe, "eodem <lb/>
            modo ut antea cum ipsi in agris dege­ <lb/>
            rent " ; and others, otherwise. With the <lb/>
            phrase itself Bergler aptly compares <lb/>
            Acharnians 370-4. The word <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἰσχάδας</foreign> <lb/>
            in the next line seems to refer to the <lb/>
            donatives which the orators obtained for <lb/>
            the hungry populace.</p>
          <p>637. <foreign xml:lang="grc">δικροι̑ςἐώθουν</foreign>] These words are <lb/>

            clamoribus tanquam furcis, which would <lb/>
            be a strange comparison. The phrase is <lb/>
            a common one; and Florent Chretien <lb/>
            and Bergler have already cited the <lb/>

            the operations of Brasidas on the N.W. <lb/>

          <p>HERM. Then your labouring population, flocking in from vale and plain, <lb/>
            Never d'reamed that, like the others, they themselves were sold for gain; <lb/>
            But as having lost their grape-stones, and desiring figs to get, <lb/>
            Every one his rapt attention on the public speakers set; <lb/>
            These beheld you poor and famished, lacking all your home supplies, <lb/>
            Straight they pitchforked out the Goddess, scouting her with yells and cries, <lb/>
            Whensoe'er (for much she loved you) back she turned with wistful eyes. <lb/>
            Then with suits they vexed and harassed your substantial rich allies, <lb/>
            Whispering in your ear, “ The fellow leans to Brasirlas,”and you <lb/>
            Like a pack of hounds in chorus on the quivering victim flew. <lb/>
            Yea, the City, sick and pallid, shivering with disease and fright, <lb/>
            Any calumny they cast her, ate with ravenous appetite. <lb/>
            Till at last your friends perceiving whence their heavy wounds arose, <lb/>
            Stopped with gold the mouths of speakers who were such disastrous foes.</p>
          <p>alert, each wishing to be the first to <lb/>
            revolt (iv. 108). And Athens, though <lb/>
            vigilant and energetic as ever, was yet <lb/>
            full of alarm and suspicion, not knowing <lb/>
            on whom to depend. That an ally was <lb/>
            " leaning to Brasidas" was an intimation <lb/>
            requiring, and sure to receive, immediate <lb/>
            attention. In Wasps 473 the foiled <lb/>
            and irritated dicasts, passing in their <lb/>
            wrath from the trochaic to the abrupt <lb/>

            is admirably described by Wordsworth <lb/>
            (Athens and Attica, chap. x). The <lb/>
            limestone rock, upon which Athens <lb/>
            stands, is constantly protruding through <lb/>
            its meagre superstratum of soil, like the <lb/>
            bones of an emaciated body (to use the <lb/>
            simile of Plato, Critias 111 B), through <lb/>
            its torn and shrivelled skin. Athenian <lb/>
            ingenuity adapted this geological forma­ <lb/>
            tion to architectural purposes, and <lb/>
            everywhere the living rock is itself hewn <lb/>
            into theatres, seats, steps, walls, cis­ <lb/>
            terns, and the like. The Pnyx may be <lb/>
            roughly described as a semicircular area, <lb/>
            along the chord of which ran a project­ <lb/>
            ing ridge of this solid rock. In the <lb/>

            In military matters ? TRYG. Excellent: <lb/>
            Only he's not his so-called father's son; <lb/>
            For if he goes to battle, in a trice <lb/>
            He proves himself a castaway - of shields.</p>
          <p>HERM. Still further listen what she asks me now. <lb/>
            Who is it now that sways the Assembly stone ?</p>
          <p>TRYG. Hyperbolas at present holds the place. <lb/>
            But how now, Mistress ? Why avert your eyes ?</p>
          <p>HERM. She turns away in anger from the people, <lb/>
            For taking to itself so vile a leader.</p>
          <p>TRYG. He's a mere makeshift: we'll not use him now. <lb/>
            'Twas that the people, bare and stripped of leaders, <lb/>
            Just caught him up to gird itself withal.</p>
          <p>nearly where the centre of the circle <lb/>
            would be) there juts out a prominent <lb/>
            piece of rock, 10 or 12 feet high, which <lb/>
            is hewn into the pulpit or rostra from <lb/>
            which the Athenian orators addressed <lb/>
            the Assembly in the area before them. <lb/>
            This was the famous Bema or Pnyx­ <lb/>
            stone. The Pnyx derived its name <lb/>

            the Scholiast observes, the first poet <lb/>
            who wrote for hire, and many tales are <lb/>

            which he practised the joyous Art." <lb/>
            (That Simonides was a lover of money, <lb/>

            in the very evening of his life, and <lb/>
            about which Athenaeus (Book xiii) col. <lb/>
            lects so many scandalous anecdotes; <lb/>
            with that easy and accommodating dispo­ <lb/>
            sition—<foreign xml:lang="grc">εὐκολία</foreign>—which distinguished him <lb/>
            his whole life through, and which Aristo­ <lb/>
            phanes supposed him to have carried <lb/>
            into his grave (Frogs 82) ; and even with <lb/>
            the dubious tradition which the writer <lb/>
            of his life records about the domestic <lb/>
            troubles of his old age; that I cannot <lb/>
            help suspecting that these lines are in­ <lb/>

            thing with which we are unacquainted, <lb/>
            to some passing incident in the poet's <lb/>
            life, or to some expression in his plays. <lb/>

            jovial old Poet turned the laugh against <lb/>
            his rival by his celebrated Play of the <lb/>
            Flagon, <foreign xml:lang="grc">Πυτίνη</foreign>,which carried off the <lb/>
            prize from the <foreign xml:lang="grc">Κόννοςο</foreign>f Ameipsias, and <lb/>
            the Clouds of Aristophanes. In this <lb/>

            mistress who had seduced him from his <lb/>
            first and lawful love, the Comic Muse ; <lb/>
            and it was here, in all probability, that <lb/>

              been no Laconian invasion, to which his <lb/>

              should be put to death. It may be, <lb/>
              therefore, that Aristophanes is merely <lb/>

            The first two lines denounce with <lb/>

            singing his own praises with keen <lb/>
            relish and equal vigour. The main <lb/>
            ground of his self-praise is that just as <lb/>
            Aeschylus had raised and ennobled <lb/>
            Tragedy, so he himself had elevated and <lb/>
            exalted Comedy from mere vulgar farce <lb/>
            and attacks for paltry ends upon paltry <lb/>
            objects into a high intellectual enter­ <lb/>
            tainment, a mighty instrument for good, <lb/>
            alike in the social and in the political <lb/>
            world. In order that none of his merits <lb/>
            may be overlooked, he actually borrows, <lb/>
            with but slight alterations, from the <lb/>
            Parabasis of the Wasps (acted in the <lb/>
            preceding year) his own description of <lb/>
            the fearless gallantry with which he <lb/>

            High thoughts and high language he brought on the stage, a humour exalted and rare, <lb/>
            Nor stooped with a scurrilous jest to assail some small-man-and-woman affair. <lb/>
            No, he at the mightiest quarry of all with the soul of a Heracles flew, <lb/>
            And he braved the vile scent of the tan-pit, and went through foul-mouthed revilings for you. <lb/>
            And I at the outset came down in the lists with the jaggèd-fanged monster to fight, <lb/>

            And around his forehead the thin forked tongues of a hundred sycophants quiver, <lb/>
            And his smell was the smell of a seal, and his voice was a brawling tempestuous River, <lb/>
            And his hinder parts like a furnace appeared, and a goblin's uncleansable liver. <lb/>

            STROPHE. In this hastily constructed <lb/>
            Comedy these do not rise to the lyrical <lb/>
            elevation attained in the other Plays. <lb/>
            They are mainly little satirical pieces, <lb/>
            the first aimed at Carcinus and his sons, <lb/>
            the second at two worthless Tragedians, <lb/>
            Morsimus and Melanthius. But in each <lb/>
            case the satire is prefaced by 3½ musical <lb/>
            lines based on the Choral melodies of <lb/>
            Stesichorus. As regards the strophe, the <lb/>
            Scholiast merely says that the commence­ <lb/>
            ment <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐστὶ Στησιχόρειος</foreign> ; but he sets out <lb/>
            the lines adapted in the antistrophe, from <lb/>
            which we can see how extremely free the <lb/>
            adaptation was. The correspondence of <lb/>
            the strophe and antistrophe is, as Mr. <lb/>
            Sharpley points out, very close; the <lb/>
            Stesichorean melody closes at the same <lb/>

            thins takes the place of Carcinus as <lb/>
            a bad tragedian in the corresponding <lb/>
            foot of the antistrophe ; whilst in the <lb/>
            two long lines filled with abusive terms <lb/>

          <p>784. <foreign xml:lang="grc">παίδων</foreign>] Three sons of Careinus <lb/>
            were dancers and one was also a Tragic <lb/>
            poet: their dwarfish ungainly figures, <lb/>
            and their extraordinary contortions as <lb/>
            they danced in their father's choruses, <lb/>
            were constant subjects for the mirth of <lb/>
            Aristophanes. See especially the closing <lb/>
            scene in the Wasps where all three are in­ <lb/>
            troduced. They seem to have invented <lb/>
            some mechanical contrivances to assist <lb/>
            their efforts ; for Xenocles, who was one <lb/>
            of them, is, as the Scholiast observes, <lb/>
            called by Plato Comicus <foreign xml:lang="grc">Ξενοκλη̑ς ὁ <lb/>

          <p>788. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὄρτυγας οἰκογενε</foreign>ȋ<foreign xml:lang="grc">ς</foreign>] Quails were <lb/>
            domesticated in great numbers at Athens, <lb/>
            and trained for the sport of <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὀρτυγοκοπία</foreign>, <lb/>
            which is described by Pollux ix, Segm. <lb/>
            102,108, 109. (See the Commentary on <lb/>
            Birds 1299.) A ring was drawn round <lb/>
            the bird, which was then struck sharply <lb/>
            on the head with the finger. If it stood <lb/>
            its ground, its owner won : if it backed <lb/>
            out of the ring, he lost. Sometimes the <lb/>
            game was played for money; at other <lb/>
            times the bird itself was the stake. <lb/>
            Quail-fighting is, or was, much in vogue, <lb/>
            Button observes (Wood's translation, xii. <lb/>
            425, &amp;c.), in Italy ; and also in the East, <lb/>
            where, to use the language of Mr. Curzon, <lb/>
            in his Armenia, " quails are as plenty as <lb/>
            flies." (Shakespeare, following Plutarch <lb/>
            (Antony 33) makes Antony say of Augus­ <lb/>
            tus " His quails Beat mine, inhooped, <lb/>
            at odds," Ant. and Cleop. ii. 3.) They are <lb/>
            game and pugnacious little birds : " ecce <lb/>
            coturnices inter sua proelia vivunt," <lb/>
            says Ovid, Amor. ii. 6. 27 ; but Buffon, <lb/>
            who collects much curious information on <lb/>
            the subject, remarks that they fight with <lb/>
            their own species only, which implies <lb/>
            jealousy rather than a temper naturally <lb/>
            quarrelsome. And this seems to agree <lb/>
            with the observations of Aristotle, Hist. <lb/>
            Animal, ix. 9. Antiochus, the unlucky <lb/>
            lieutenant of Alcibiades, first gained his <lb/>
            patron's favour by capturing and re­ <lb/>
            storing to him a tame quail, which had <lb/>
            escaped from its master's robe in his <lb/>

            doubts whether the sons of Carcinus owe <lb/>

            Chorus to Cleon (Knights 401), by way <lb/>
            of imprecation. And in Frogs 151, <lb/>
            those who have transcribed a speech of <lb/>
            Morsimus are classed in the shades <lb/>
            below with parricides, perjurers, and <lb/>
            the worst of villains. Melanthius is <lb/>
            attacked in the Birds, and info 1009 he <lb/>
            is mentioned as a glutton, which explains <lb/>
            the use of the epithets <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὀψοΦάγοι ἰχθυο­ <lb/>

            that he would probably be food for fishes, <lb/>
            "And very unreasonable I should be," <lb/>
            replied the philosopher, "if I who have <lb/>

            it seems to me that <foreign xml:lang="grc">μεθαι</foreign>s not a <lb/>
            word to be passed by one speaker in the <lb/>

            nounced only by the person about to lead <lb/>
            off the prayer ; and so, Trygaeus having <lb/>

            of Boeotia are discharged into the sea, <lb/>
            these eels attained a prodigious size and <lb/>
            fatness. In Ach. 885, Dicaeopolis in­ <lb/>
            vokes the Copaic eel in strains which <lb/>
            a lover might address to his mistress, or <lb/>
            a worshipper to his divinity ; and Athe­ <lb/>
            naeus (vii. 52-6) preserves many similar <lb/>
            passages from the comic poets in eulogy <lb/>
            of this " Helen of the dinner-table," <lb/>
            this “holy divine Virgin of Copais." <lb/>
            In Lysistrata 35, where one speaker <lb/>

            ferred on the whole the eels of other <lb/>
            waters, but none were cold to the charms <lb/>
            of the Copaic eel. Thus the Sicilian <lb/>

            the Art of Cookery, whilst patriotically <lb/>
            claiming the first place for eels caught <lb/>
            in the Straits of Messina, yet admits that <lb/>

          <p>1060. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὴ γλω̃ττα χωρι̒ς τέμνεται</foreign> This <lb/>
            formula, which occurs again in Birds <lb/>
            1705 and Plutus 1110, is said to refer <lb/>
            to a custom of cutting out the victim's <lb/>
            tongue, and keeping it apart till the <lb/>
            close of the feast, to be offered with <lb/>
            libations of wine to the Herald Hermes, <lb/>
            wheu the party broke up to retire to <lb/>
            rest. There are many passages (all of <lb/>
            which, I believe, are cited by Florent <lb/>
            Chretien and Bergler), in which this <lb/>
            custom is mentioned ; but its origin and <lb/>
            meaning were obscure, even to the <lb/>
            ancients themselves. Athenaeus (i, chap. <lb/>
            28) says that the libation was made to <lb/>
            Hermes as the patron of sleep, and <lb/>
            that the tongue was selected <foreign xml:lang="grc">δὰ τὴν <lb/>

            on Apollonius Rhodius, i. 517; and on <lb/>
            the above-mentioned passages of Ari­ <lb/>
            stophanes ; as, that it was intended as <lb/>
            a sign that what had passed was not to <lb/>

            any idle word which might have offended <lb/>
            the Divine Majesty, or as a memorial <lb/>
            of some legendary adventure ; or the <lb/>

          <p>throwing back upon a speaker an ill­ <lb/>
            omened or offensive observation. Thus, <lb/>
            in Plato's Euthydemus, chap. xii, when <lb/>

            which appears to have been a sort of <lb/>
            beetle. Kirby and Spence in their 21st <lb/>
            letter (" Means by which insects defend <lb/>
            themselves ”) enumerate a variety of <lb/>
            insects, mostly beetles, which, "when <lb/>
            urged by danger, endeavour to repel it <lb/>
            by emitting disagreeable scents orftuids." <lb/>
            The common cocktail beetle defends <lb/>
            itself in this manner. "It has the <lb/>
            power of throwing out a most disgusting <lb/>

            first sight rather attractive, cannot pos­ <lb/>
            sibly be right. The <foreign xml:lang="grc">χρησμολόγος</foreign> in the <lb/>

            the soothsayer, who is still clutching <lb/>
            after the <foreign xml:lang="grc">σπλάγχνα</foreign>, not heeding, and as <lb/>

            said to have been the name of some <lb/>
            small place in the neighbourhood of <lb/>

            the servant leave the stage, driving <lb/>
            Hierocles before them. (Perhaps a <lb/>
            better explanation of this line is that <lb/>

              have discarded the unnecessary <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἤκουσας</foreign> <lb/>
              and written <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὁρα̂τε τὸν κόρακ</foreign>’. <foreign xml:lang="grc">κόραξ</foreign> of <lb/>

            and <foreign xml:lang="grc">διάγων</foreign>. The former is universally <lb/>
            adopted, and is undoubtedly right, for <lb/>
            the description of a party sitting round <lb/>
            the fire, roasting <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐρέβινθοι</foreign> (chickpease) <lb/>

            Myrtle-wreaths, too, were worn by the <lb/>
            revellers themselves (Eurip. Alcestis <lb/>
            759) ; and it would seem that the very <lb/>

            it must be remembered that the fruit of <lb/>
            the myrtle was formerly applied to a <lb/>
            great variety of culinary and medicinal <lb/>
            uses. See Pliny, Nat. Hist. xiv. 19, xv. <lb/>
            7, 35-8, xxiii. 81-3. Columella (xii. <lb/>
            38) gives some very precise recipes for <lb/>
            the manufacture of myrtle wine, some <lb/>
            species of which are highly recom­ <lb/>
            mended by Pliny as a wholesome bever­ <lb/>
            age, very grateful to invalids, and one <lb/>
            " which cheers but not inebriates." <lb/>
            Useful oils were extracted from the <lb/>
            myrtle : its leaves and berries were alike <lb/>
            esteemed for their healing properties ; <lb/>
            and, before the introduction of pepper, it <lb/>
            was in common use as a condiment. <lb/>
            Myrtle-berries, too, seem to have been <lb/>
            ordinarily eaten as a fruit. Athenaeus, <lb/>
            more than once, quotes comic fragments <lb/>
            in which <foreign xml:lang="grc">μύρτα</foreign> are enumerated among <lb/>
            other dainties (ii. 39, iii. 7, xiv. 67, 68); and <lb/>

            rally accepted as being at all events the <lb/>
            most intelligible), says that there were <lb/>
            two kinds of cottabus : (1) the <foreign xml:lang="grc">κατακτὸς</foreign>, <lb/>
            and (2) the cottabus <foreign xml:lang="grc">δι</foreign>’ <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὸξυβάφων</foreign>. And <lb/>
            referring to this passage of Aristophanes, <lb/>
            he explains the <foreign xml:lang="grc">κατακτὸς</foreign> thus :-A tall <lb/>
            candelabrum-like shaft was set up, to <lb/>
            which was attached a small bronze statu­ <lb/>
            ette, called Manes (a common name for a <lb/>
            slave, cf. supr. 1146). Above the head of <lb/>
            the Manes a little scale, <foreign xml:lang="grc">πλάστιγξ</foreign> or <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">πινάκιον</foreign>, was suspended from a rod, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ῥάβδος</foreign> </p><pb n="157"/>

            How in the world am I to use it now ?</p>
          <p>TRYG. I'll tell you how. Fill up this mouth with lead, <lb/>
            Then fix a longish rod, here at the top, <lb/>
            And there you'll have a dropping cottabus.</p>
          <p>TRUMPETER. 0 me ! he mocks me. TRYG. Heroes another plan :</p>
          <p><foreign xml:lang="grc">κοτταβικὴ</foreign>, and if the wine drops were <lb/>
            cleverly flung into this scale, it would fall <lb/>
            and strike the Manes with a sharp ringing <lb/>
            sound. The game was of course suscep­ <lb/>
            tible of an infinity of modifications, but it <lb/>
            would seem by comparing the descriptions <lb/>
            given by Pollux vi, Segm. 109,110, Athe­ <lb/>
            naeus xv. 4, 5, and the Scholiasts here, <lb/>
            that the distinguishing characteristic of <lb/>
            the <foreign xml:lang="grc">κατακτὸς κότταβος</foreign> was the dropping or <lb/>
            falling scale, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ή καταβαλλομένη πλάτιγξ</foreign>, <lb/>
            whilst in the cottabus <foreign xml:lang="grc">δι</foreign>’ <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὸξυβάφων</foreign> there <lb/>
            was no scale, but a number of tiny boats, <lb/>
            whether with or without lamps, were set <lb/>
            afloat upon water, and the object of the <lb/>
            player was to submerge as many as pos­ <lb/>
            sible with one throw. Divers complica­ <lb/>
            tions were introduced into the <foreign xml:lang="grc">κατακτὸς <lb/>
            κότταβος</foreign> for the sake of increasing the <lb/>
            amount of skill and ingenuity required. <lb/>
            Sometimes there was a pair of scales, fas­ <lb/>
            tened as in a balance, with a bronze sta­ <lb/>
            tuette under each, and the wine being <lb/>
            thrown into one scale sent it down upon <lb/>
            the Manes beneath it, whence it sprang <lb/>
            up with a rebound sufficient to drop the <lb/>
            other scale upon the other Manes. Or <lb/>
            again, water was placed under each scale, <lb/>
            and the wine flung into one scale sub­ <lb/>
            merged it beneath the water, until <lb/>
            brought up by a cast into the opposite <lb/>
            scale. Or again, the scale, detached, <lb/>
            had to strike the Manes at such an angle <lb/>
            as to fall into a bason placed below it. <lb/>
            Sometimes the frame that supported the <lb/>
            apparatus was a chandelier swinging from <lb/>
            the ceiling ; sometimes the winedrops <lb/>
            were not flung from the cup, but squirted <lb/>
            from the mouth. Athenaeus (xv. 1-7 <lb/>
            and elsewhere) quotes from the Come­ <lb/>
            dians a vast number of pleasant passages <lb/>
            illustrative of the game. In one extract <lb/>
            from the ’<foreign xml:lang="grc">Αφροδίτης</foreign> yoval of Antiphanes, <lb/>
            all the details of the game and the proper <lb/>
            mode of making the throw are very hap­ <lb/>
            pily explained to a wondering novice. <lb/>

            connexion with the balance, info 1248, <lb/>
            must not be understood as implying that <lb/>
            a <foreign xml:lang="grc">πλάστιγξ</foreign> was not also to be employed <lb/>

            ten by Antimachus of Colophon in a <lb/>
            much later age, indeed about the era of <lb/>

            equal length : the last three lines of the <lb/>
            Play, the farewell of Trygaeus, standing <lb/>
            by themselves. One line, the third in the <lb/>
            first antistrophe, is lost. The glyconics <lb/>

          <p>THE Peace is found, in a more or less perfect condition, in eight MSS. <lb/>
            They are :- <lb/>
            R. The Ravenna MS. <lb/>
            V. The first Venetian (No. 474, St. Mark's Library, Venice). <lb/>
            I. The Vaticano-Palatine (Pal. No. 67, Vatican Library). <lb/>
            F. The first Florentine (No. 31, 15, Laurentian Library). <lb/>
            p1, The second Parisian (No. 2715, National Library, Paris). <lb/>
            P2. The third Parisian (No. 2717, National Library, Paris).</p>
          <p>V2. The third Venetian (No. 475, St. Mark's Library).</p>
          <p>D. Havniensis (No. 190, Royal Library, Copenhagen).</p>
          <p>A careful collation of the first six MSS. has recently been published <lb/>
            in Zacher's edition. It was commenced by Velsen who collated R. V. F. <lb/>
            and the first 131 lines of I. The collation of this MS. was completed by <lb/>
            A. Wilmanns, " cujus collatio," says Bachmann, " non semper satis <lb/>
            accurata videtur." On Velsen's death the work was continued by <lb/>
            Zacher who collated Pl. and P2., but he too died before the edition was <lb/>
            ready for publication; and it was finally revised, and published with <lb/>
            a careful preface, by Bachmann. V2. is said in Bachmann's Preface to <lb/>
            be a mere copy of V., and D. to correspond with 1. P2. The publication <lb/>
            of Velsen's collations, and still more the photogravures of R. and V., <lb/>
             <pb n="173"/>
            have shown how inconceivably inaccurate were all previous collations, <lb/>
            and I have thought it better to confine myself to the readings given <lb/>
            in Zacher's edition, though invariably verifying from the photogravures <lb/>
            the readings of those two all-important MSS.</p>
          <p>It. and V. are the only MSS. which give the Play in its entirety. <lb/>
            All the other four omit from 947 to 1012; and none of them have lines <lb/>
            1355,1356. F. and Pl. indeed end the Play at line 1300. And in addition <lb/>
            to these gaps F. omits the first 377 lines; from 490 to 548; from 837 <lb/>
            to 893; and from 1126 to 1190.</p>
          <p>The first printed edition of Aristophanes was that published at Venice <lb/>
            by Aldo Pio Manuzio, A.D. 1498, the immediate editor being Marco <lb/>
            Musuro, a native of Crete, and afterwards Abp. of Monovasia. It was at <lb/>
            first intended to comprise seven Plays only, the Plutus, the Clouds, the <lb/>
            Frogs, the Knights, the Acharnians, the Wasps, and the Birds. At the <lb/>
            end of the Birds is the following finis: <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BELL_08_fig227.jpg"/></figure></p>
          <p>But before publication the editor had obtained and added to the work <lb/>
            two more Comedies, the Peace and the Ecclesiazusae; so that the Editio <lb/>
            Princeps, as published, contained all the Comedies we now possess except <lb/>
            the Lysistrata and the Thesmophoriazusae.</p>
          <p>Of course we cannot tell with certainty what were the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀντίγραφα <lb/>
            διάφορα</foreign> from which Musuro collected the nine Plays and their Scholia, <lb/>
            but it is generally agreed that he had before him amongst other <lb/>
            documents I. or a very similar MS.; and there is no doubt that for the <lb/>
            two additional Comedies he had also Pl. or a duplicate of Pl., since almost <lb/>
            all the numerous liberties with the text in which the writer of that MS. <lb/>
             <pb n="174"/>
            indulges are reproduced in the pages of the Aldine edition. Probably <lb/>
            some of the MSS. employed by the early editors have ceased to exist: <lb/>
            they would be used as copy for the press and so become soiled and torn; <lb/>
            and might well be cast away as worthless when their contents had been <lb/>
            committed to print.</p>
          <p>The Lysistrata and the Thesmophoriazusae remained unpublished for <lb/>
            seventeen years longer. But in the year 1515 two small volumes were <lb/>
            issued at Florence by the Giunta family; the earlier containing the nine <lb/>
            Comedies published by Manuzio, the later the two theretofore unpublished <lb/>
            Comedies. The two volumes are, I believe, always found bound together, <lb/>
            aud go by the name of "Junta." Ten years later the same family <lb/>
            published a third edition of Aristophanes under the editorship of Antonio <lb/>
            Fracini. Fracini is supposed to have had access to the Ravenna or some <lb/>
            very similar MS., since the important improvements which he introduced <lb/>
            into the text correspond very closely with the readings of R. In the <lb/>
            present Play, amongst other things, he was the first to print the 65 lines <lb/>
            from 947 to 1012 which are omitted in Aldus and Junta, as in every <lb/>
            known MS. except R. and V. In all these the line <foreign xml:lang="grc">ει</foreign>s <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀγαθὰ μεταβιβὰζει</foreign> <lb/>
            is immediately followed by <foreign xml:lang="grc">εἶτα μονω̩δει̑ν ἐκΜηδείας</foreign>. He did not, however, <lb/>
            include in his edition either the Lysistrata or the Thesmophoriazusae, <lb/>
            nor did his successor Gormont in his Paris edition of 1528 (the first <lb/>
            edition published out of Italy) ; and the eleven Plays were not published <lb/>
            in one volume until Cratander so published them at Basle in the year <lb/>
            1532. Thenceforward the eleven Plays have always been printed <lb/>
            together.</p>
          <p>The text as settled by the earliest editions remained substantially <lb/>
            unaltered for some two centuries. A few slight corrections were made <lb/>
            by Zanetti, and others, more numerous and more important, by <lb/>
            Grynaeus, but as a rule editors were content to hand on the text as they <lb/>
            received it from their predecessors. The edition which Aemilius Portus, <lb/>
            another Cretan scholar, published at Geneva in 1607 has perhaps been <lb/>
            unduly depreciated. If the editor added little of his own, he generally <lb/>
            contrived to select the best of the various readings adopted by earlier <lb/>
             <pb n="175"/>
            scholars. And he was the first to publish, together with the Greek, <lb/>
            a Latin translation and notes. It is true that neither the translation nor <lb/>
            the notes were his own; the former was a combination of the verse <lb/>
            translations of Florent Chretien and Frischlin, and for the remaining <lb/>
            Plays the prose translation of Andreas Divus; the latter consisted of the <lb/>
            Greek notes of Bisetus on all the eleven Comedies, and of Bourdin on the <lb/>
            Thesmophoriazusae, and the Latin notes of Girard on the Plutus, and <lb/>
            of Florent Chretien on the Wasps, the Peace, and the Lysistrata. He <lb/>
            also published the Greek scholia on the nine Aldine Plays as Aldus, <lb/>
            Fracini, and Gelenius had already done. And, on the whole, his edition <lb/>
            made the Comedies far more intelligible to the ordinary reader than they <lb/>
            had ever been before. It was however altogether superseded by Kuster's <lb/>
            edition published in 1710, a work on much the same plan, but carried <lb/>
            out with far greater erudition on the part of the editor, and with much <lb/>
            more important subsidiary appliances than existed in the time of Portus. <lb/>
            Kuster was the first editor to avail himself systematically of the help <lb/>
            afforded by the MSS. He tells us that he had consulted five which he calls <lb/>
            Vaticano-Urbinas, Vaticano-Palatine, Bodleian, Arundel, and Vossianus, <lb/>
            and which have been identified with the MSS. called in this series <lb/>
            U. (No. 141), I. (No. 67), the MS. x. 1 in the Library of Lincoln <lb/>
            College, Oxford, L3. (the fourth London, Arundel 530), and Bentley's <lb/>
            copy, now in the Library of Trinity College, Cambridge, of 1. (No 52. <lb/>
            in the University Library, Leyden). See Professor John Williams <lb/>
            Whitens articles on "the MSS. of Aristophanes." Apparently he relied <lb/>
            mostly, and very wisely, on the two Vatican MSS. which enabled him <lb/>
            to effect several important improvements. But his text is very unequal. <lb/>
            Many of the most glaring errors, both in language and in metre, are <lb/>
            entirely overlooked. Except that for the three versions by Andreas <lb/>
            Divus he substituted versions of the Birds by Hemsterhuys, of the <lb/>
            Ecclesiazusae by Le Fevre, and of the Thesmophoriazusae by himself, he <lb/>
            retained everything that was in Portus's edition. But he added a series <lb/>
            of valuable annotations by various scholars; by himself on all the <lb/>
            Comedies except the Wasps and the Peace; by Paulmier on the <lb/>
             <pb n="176"/>
            Lysistrata ; by Casaubon on the Knights; by Spanheim on the Clouds, <lb/>
            Frogs, and Plutus; by Le Fevre on the Ecclesiazusae; and by Bentley <lb/>
            on the Clouds and the Plutus. Moreover the copy of the Leyden MS. <lb/>
            which Bentley sent him contained the Scholia on the Lysistrata which <lb/>
            were for the first time published in this edition. No Scholia on the <lb/>
            Thesmophoriazusae were published until more than a century later, <lb/>
            viz. in Bekker's edition of 1829.</p>
          <p>Kuster was followed half a century later by Bergler, whose brief notes <lb/>
            enter fully into the spirit of Aristophanes, and teem with apt illustrations <lb/>
            and terse and happy comments. He made too some brilliant conjectural <lb/>
            amendments, but did not turn his attention to a systematic improvement <lb/>
            of the text. And unfortunately he died before the work was published, <lb/>
            and its publication was undertaken by Peter Burmann the younger, <lb/>
            a dull man incapable of appreciating either Aristophanes or Bergler. <lb/>
            Consequently the text which he prepared for Bergler's edition is as <lb/>
            infelicitous as Bergler's own annotations are brilliant.</p>
          <p>Brunck's edition was originally published at Strasburg in the year <lb/>
            1783, and the assistance afforded him by the Parisian MSS., and his own <lb/>
            sound practical judgement, enabled him to effect a very material improve­ <lb/>
            ment in the text of Aristophanes. He seems to have been the first <lb/>
            editor who went carefully through each Comedy, weighing every line, and <lb/>
            endeavouring to detect, and, so far as he could, to remedy, every <lb/>
            inaccuracy either of metre or of language. Hardly any error escaped <lb/>
            his notice, but not having access to the best MSS. he frequently failed <lb/>
            to administer the right remedy for the disease. Indeed on more than <lb/>
            one occasion, in reliance on the unsafe MS. which is called P1., he <lb/>
            unquestionably left the right path for the wrong." But his edition <lb/>
            was a remarkable advance on all preceding ones; it was universally <lb/>
            recognized as giving the standard text of Aristophanes; and would <lb/>
            doubtless have held its own till now, but for the flood of light unex­ <lb/>
            pectedly thrown upon the text by the discovery (or rediscovery) of <lb/>
            the great Ravenna and Venetian MSS.</p>
          <p>The Ravenna MS. was brought to the notice of Western scholars by <lb/>
             <pb n="177"/>
            Invernizzi in the year 1794. The edition which he commenced was <lb/>
            continued by Beck and completed by Dindorf. But Invernizzi's tran­ <lb/>
            scription of the MS. was of a deplorably imperfect and faulty character. <lb/>
            And the whole MS. together with the Venetian (which for the Peace is <lb/>
            hardly less valuable than the Ravenna) was again collated by Immanuel <lb/>
            Bekker, whose excellent Variorum edition, published in London in the <lb/>
            year 1829, professed to show, either in the text or in the footnotes, <lb/>
            every variation of these two important MSS. The results were embodied <lb/>
            in Dindorf's Oxford edition of 1835. But Bekker's own collation, though <lb/>
            vastly superior to Invernizzi's, was itself very far from accurate; and <lb/>
            the only thoroughly trustworthy collations that have ever been published <lb/>
            are those by Adolphus von Velsen of the Knights, the Peace, the <lb/>
            Thesmophoriazusae, the Frogs, the Ecclesiazusae, and the Plutus. <lb/>
            However the importance of collations has been considerably diminished <lb/>
            by the publication of photogravures of both these MSS.; that of the <lb/>
            Venetian in London and Boston, 1902, and that of the Ravenna in Leyden, <lb/>
            1904.</p>
          <p>I did not, in my former Appendix to the Peace, attempt to criticize <lb/>
            any editions published in my own lifetime, nor do I propose to do so <lb/>
            now, beyond observing that with Cobet and Meineke an era of <lb/>
            systematic corruption of the text was, most unhappily, inaugurated. <lb/>
            Empty irrational rules are formulated by anybody who has the audacity <lb/>
            to formulate them, and when the MSS. show them to be unfounded, it is <lb/>
            the MSS., and not the rules, which have to be altered. And he is acclaimed <lb/>
            the aptest scholar who can make the most numerous alterations. If <lb/>
            Aristophanes wrote one thing an editor will remark " Malim some other <lb/>
            thing," and merely on the ground of the editor's preference that other <lb/>
            thing at once takes its place in the text. Another editor considers his <lb/>
            suggestion "multo elegantius" than what Aristophanes wrote, and again <lb/>
            this much more elegant suggestion is substituted for the genuine reading. <lb/>
            That is the right way to correct a schoolboy's exercise, but it is most <lb/>
            emphatically the wrong way to deal with the writings of an ancient <lb/>
            poet, towards whom our attitude should be that of learners, and not that <note type="footnote"> PEACE </note> <note type="footnote"> N </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="178"/>
            of a dictatorial schoolmaster. One can imagine the indescribable mess into <lb/>
            which the Plays of Shakespeare would be thrown were they to be treated <lb/>
            in a similar manner even now, and much more 2000 years hence when <lb/>
            tastes and ideas may have undergone a complete transformation.</p>
          <p>I observed in my former Appendix that no complete edition of <lb/>
            Aristophanes, and indeed no complete edition of the Peace, had ever <lb/>
            been published by an English scholar; but although that was true in <lb/>
            1866, it is not true now. It is, however, still true that (as I proceeded to <lb/>
            say) no country has contributed more than our own to the improvement <lb/>
            of the Aristophanic text. The marvellous sagacity of Bentley had <lb/>
            already anticipated a great number of the corrections which were sub­ <lb/>
            sequently supplied from the MSS.; and " it is not too much to say," <lb/>
            as Bp. Monk (Life of Bentley, i. 195) most truly observes, "that had <lb/>
            he given his mind to such a work, no person ever lived who was so well <lb/>
            qualified for an editor of the great Comedian of Athens." His letters <lb/>
            on the subject to Kuster, published more fully in the Museum Criticum <lb/>
            than in Kuster's own edition, are specimens of literary criticism only less <lb/>
            delightful and instructive than his own immortal Dissertation on <lb/>
            Phalaris; and his marginal jottings on Aristophanes, printed in the same <lb/>
            Museum and in the Classical Journal, are altogether worthy of his <lb/>
            unrivalled reputation. The Aristophanic criticisms of Dawes are famous <lb/>
            all over the world; and truly, to pass from his Miscellanea Critica to <lb/>
            such works as the Vindiciae Aristophaneae of Meineke and Herwerden, <lb/>
            is like passing from the Garden of Eden to a barren and dry land where <lb/>
            no water is. Nor are the conjectures of Thomas Tyrwhitt, though briefer <lb/>
            and less concerned with general principles, unworthy to stand by the side <lb/>
            of the conjectures of Dawes. Person, to use the language of Bps. Monk <lb/>
            and Blomfield in their Preface to his Adversaria, "in Aristophanem <lb/>
            expoliendum semper incumbebat, et in hoc omnes nervos intendebat; <lb/>
            quin etiam credibile est, si vita suppeditasset, Comicorum principem <lb/>
            demum exiturum fnisse, a principe Criticorum innumeris fere locis <lb/>
            restitutum, Atticoque suo nitore postliminio donatum." His numerous, <lb/>
            though brief, criticisms were, after his death, edited by P. P. Dobree, <lb/>
             <pb n="179"/>
            whose own acute lucubrations were similarly given to the world by the <lb/>
            late Professor Scholefield. And finally no Aristophanic scholar is more <lb/>
            constantly cited or more highly appreciated by foreign critics than Peter <lb/>
            Elmsley, whose notes on the Acharnians are full of careful and patient <lb/>
            observation upon the text, not only of that Play, but also of Aristophanes <lb/>
            generally.</p>

          <p>The Destructive Criticism of these latter days has dealt gently with <lb/>
            the old Attic Comedy. No one has yet discovered, so far at least as <lb/>
            I am aware, that a Play of Aristophanes is a thing of shreds and patches <lb/>
            put together by the order of Peisistratus; or that it was composed by <lb/>
            "Lord Bacon," or in the days of the Maccabees. Doubtless these things <lb/>
            will come in good time; else how will the Professorial mind amuse itself <lb/>
            in all the centuries to be.</p>
          <p>I think that my original Appendix to this Play was the first attempt <lb/>
            to bring together the various readings of the MSS. and editions. In it I <lb/>
            proposed " to give the whole of the variations of the Ravenna and Venetian <lb/>
            MSS. according to Bekker's recension; the whole of the variations of the <lb/>
            Parisian MSS. so far as they are recorded by Brunck; and a tolerably <lb/>
             <pb n="181"/>
            complete collection of the various readings found in all the most <lb/>
            noteworthy editions which have been published since the collation of the <lb/>
            Ravenna and Venetian MSS.," besides giving a general account of the <lb/>
            readings of the earlier editions. But since then many similar collections <lb/>
            have been made, fuller and better than mine, and it did not seem <lb/>
            desirable in the present Appendix to repeat all the minute variations <lb/>
            of the MSS. and editions. Indeed the most important MS. readings, <lb/>
            those of the Ravenna and the Venetian MSS., are now brought within <lb/>
            the reach of every scholar by the publication of the two photogravures <lb/>
            as mentioned above. The present Appendix therefore contains only such <lb/>
            variations as appeared to be of some little importance or interest.</p>
          <p>1. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὡς τάχιστα κανθάρω̜</foreign> MSS. vulgo. is­ <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">τάχας τω̜̑κανθάρω̜</foreign> Kiehl, Richter, Blaydes, <lb/>
            Herwerden, Van Leeuwen, Zacher, and <lb/>
            Graves. Nothing but necessity would <lb/>
            justify an alteration which destroys the <lb/>
            rhythm of the line, and there is no <lb/>
            necessity here. The Greek dramatists <lb/>
            were not so strict about the use of the <lb/>
            article as modern critics are. And here <lb/>
            too there is the special circumstance <lb/>
            that the word <foreign xml:lang="grc">κανθάρω̜ι</foreign>s introduced <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">παρὰ προσδοκίαν</foreign>, without any preliminary <lb/>
            intimation having been given to the <lb/>
            audience of the existence of a beetle.</p>
          <p>2, 3. Dobree gives these two lines to <lb/>
            the second servant, and this is followed <lb/>
            by Weise, Meineke, and several other edi­ <lb/>
            tors. Yet while the traditional reading, <lb/>
            given in my text, is perfectly plain and <lb/>
            simple, Dobree's rearrangement bristles <lb/>
            with difficulties, and requires numerous <lb/>
            alterations of the text. It rests on <lb/>
            a misunderstanding of the word <foreign xml:lang="grc">τρέφει</foreign> <lb/>
            in the scholium, which has no reference <lb/>
            to the manual act of feeding an animal, <lb/>
            but means keeps, is in charge of; Clouds <lb/>
            109, 1407, Wasps 835, 928, Plutus 173, <lb/>
            &amp;c. For <foreign xml:lang="grc">αὐτω̜̑</foreign> in verse 2 Bentley sug­ <lb/>
            gested <foreign xml:lang="grc">αὐτὴν</foreign>, Lenting <foreign xml:lang="grc">αὐτὸ</foreign>, Richter <foreign xml:lang="grc">αὐτὸς</foreign>, <lb/>
            and Herwerden <foreign xml:lang="grc">αὖθις</foreign>. But <foreign xml:lang="grc">αὐτω̩̑</foreign>) is <lb/>
            obviously right, and it was hardly neces­ <lb/>
            sary for Dobree to refer to infra 1121 <lb/>
            and Frogs 1121. And for <foreign xml:lang="grc">φάγαι</foreign> in v. 3 <lb/>
            Brunck reads <foreign xml:lang="grc">φάγαις</foreign>. "Qua emenda­ <lb/>
            tiones non opus," says Richter," quum <lb/>
            infra quoque legamus <foreign xml:lang="grc">κατέφαγεν</foreign> et <foreign xml:lang="grc">φησίν</foreign>." <lb/>
            But of course what Brunck meant was, <lb/>
            not that the term <foreign xml:lang="grc">φάγαι</foreign> was in itself <lb/>
            inapplicable, but that the imprecation <lb/>
            lost all its force if referred to the beetle <lb/>
            whose favourite food the <foreign xml:lang="grc">μα̑ζα</foreign> in question <lb/>
            was. However his alteration is quite <lb/>
            inadmissible.</p>
          <p>5. <foreign xml:lang="grc">νμ̑ν δὴ "φερες</foreign>. Bergler (in notes), <lb/>
            Brunck, recentiores. <foreign xml:lang="grc">νυ̑ν δ' ἤφερες</foreign> MSS. <lb/>
            (except P1.), editions before Brunck. <foreign xml:lang="grc">νυ̑ν <lb/>
            γ ἤφερες</foreign> Pl. Dobree, and those who <lb/>
            adopt his arrangement, give the whole <lb/>
            of this verse and the first two words of <lb/>
            the next to the second servant: thence <lb/>
            to the end of v. 8 to the first. Meineke <lb/>
            (Vind. Aristoph.) truly says, "Servus <lb/>
             <pb n="182"/>
            (secundus) non potuit quaerere <foreign xml:lang="grc">που̑</foreign> yap <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἣνυ̑ν δὴ ἤφερες</foreign>; siquidem <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὰ φέρειν</foreign> <lb/>
            pinsentis servi est"; but instead of <lb/>
            discarding the faulty and perverse ar­ <lb/>
            rangement which alone creates the <lb/>
            difficulty, he would alter <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἔφερες</foreign> into <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἔφεραν</foreign>. And this is actually done by <lb/>
            Blaydes.</p>
          <p>7. <foreign xml:lang="grc">περικυλίσας</foreign> Bentley, Brunck, recen­ <lb/>
            tiores, except Richter. And this, which <lb/>
            seems to have been the reading of the <lb/>
            Scholiast, is confirmed by the passages of <lb/>
            Aristotle and Aelian referred to in the <lb/>
            Commentary. <foreign xml:lang="grc">περικυκλίσας</foreign> MSS. (except <lb/>

            tiores, except Bothe and Weise, and <lb/>
            except that one or two editors write it <lb/>

            before Invernizzi; and Bothe and Weise <lb/>
            afterwards. This line, according to <lb/>
            Dobree's arrangement, is given to the <lb/>
            first, and the next to the second, servant. <lb/>
            Yet Meineke (V. A.) justly says " Servo <lb/>
            pinsenti qui se imparem esse tarn foedo <lb/>
            negotio dixerat, responderi non potuit <lb/>
            a primo servo quod nunc respondetur." <lb/>
            But here again, instead of returning <lb/>
            to the traditional arrangement which <lb/>
            does not present a single difficulty or <lb/>
            require a single emendation, he would <lb/>
            further tamper with the text by sub­ <lb/>
            stituting <foreign xml:lang="grc">αἶσε</foreign> for <foreign xml:lang="grc">αἴσω</foreign>. For <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὴν ἀντλίαν</foreign> <lb/>
            Van Leeuwen reads <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὴν κάρδαπαν</foreign>, the <lb/>
            Scholiast here saying <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀντὶ ταυ τὴν σκάφην</foreign>, <lb/>
            and Pollux (x. 102) observing <foreign xml:lang="grc">Μένανδρας</foreign> <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BELL_08_fig228.jpg"/></figure> <lb/>
              <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐν Εἰρήνη̩</foreign>. But Pollux means that Aris­ <lb/>
              tophanes used <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀντλία</foreign>, not <foreign xml:lang="grc">κάρδαπας</foreign>, in <lb/>
              the sense of <foreign xml:lang="grc">σκάφη</foreign> in the Peace. And <lb/>
              so the other grammarians ; <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀντλία, σκάφη</foreign> <lb/>
              Hesychius, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀντλία, ἡσκάφη</foreign> Suidas, quoting <lb/>
              this very line.</p>
          <p>20. <foreign xml:lang="grc">αἶδ'ἐμαὶ</foreign> Brunck, recentiores,except <lb/>
            Bothe and Richter, who, with the MSS. <lb/>
            and editions before Brunck, read <foreign xml:lang="grc">αἶδέ μαι</foreign>.</p>
          <p>32. <foreign xml:lang="grc">τέως ἕως ... λάθη̩ς</foreign> MSS. vulgo. <lb/>
            And so the line is quoted by Priscian, <lb/>
            p. 1206, and by the Scholiast on Plato's <lb/>
            Hipparchus. Dawes, observing that <foreign xml:lang="grc">τέως <lb/>
            ἕως</foreign> are not elsewhere conjoined by any <lb/>
            Attic writer, and that <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἕως</foreign> with the sub­ <lb/>
            junctive requires <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἂν</foreign>, proposed <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἕως σεαυτὸν</foreign> <lb/>
            av <foreign xml:lang="grc">λάθη̩ς</foreign>, which is adopted by Brunck <lb/>
            and Bothe. Reisig suggested <foreign xml:lang="grc">λάθαις</foreign> for <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">λάθη̜ς</foreign>, a suggestion followed by Dindorf, <lb/>
            Holden, Meineke, and most recent edi­ <lb/>
            tors, but which seems to me inadmissible <lb/>
            where the sense is so distinctively future <lb/>
            as it is here. And in truth <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἓως</foreign> with the <lb/>
            subjunctive is frequently found without <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἂν</foreign> in the Tragedians, and in a matter <lb/>
            of this kind, quite unconnected with <lb/>
            the superior elevation of Tragic diction, <lb/>
            it seems absurd to say that a usage <lb/>
            allowable in Tragedy was impossible in <lb/>
            Comedy. The Tragedians were not shut <lb/>
            up in one watertight compartment with <lb/>
            a certain set of words and the Comedians <lb/>
            in another with a different set. They <lb/>
            were all Athenians, speaking and writ­ <lb/>
            ing the free language of Athens, though <lb/>
             <pb n="183"/>
            of course, in their compositions, the <lb/>
            former would, as a rule, select the more <lb/>
            dignified words as more suitable to <lb/>
            Tragedy, and the latter the lighter and <lb/>
            less formal, as more suitable to Comedy.</p>
          <p>42. <foreign xml:lang="grc">Διός Σκαταιβάτου</foreign>] The Ravenna <lb/>
            Scholiast, Van Leeuwen, Zacher, and <lb/>
            Graves, and this is approved by Meineke <lb/>
            in his Vind. Aristoph. <foreign xml:lang="grc">Δτός καταιβάτου</foreign> <lb/>
            MSS. vulgo, but in R. a letter before K <lb/>
            is erased. In all probability that letter <lb/>
            was <foreign xml:lang="grc">σ</foreign>, which the eraser took to be the <lb/>
            final letter of <foreign xml:lang="grc">Διός</foreign> reduplicated. Pauw <lb/>
            conjectured <foreign xml:lang="grc">καταιπάτου</foreign>, Blaydes <foreign xml:lang="grc">σκαται­ <lb/>
            φάγου</foreign> (a word which is found in the <lb/>
            Plutus), and Rutherford <foreign xml:lang="grc">Σκαταιβότου</foreign>, <lb/>
            which is adopted by Herwerden and <lb/>
            Sharpley, and is very attractive, but <lb/>
            departs a little too far from <foreign xml:lang="grc">Καταιβάτον</foreign>. <lb/>
            In all the MSS. (except V.) and in all <lb/>
            the editions the word preceding <foreign xml:lang="grc">Διός</foreign> is <lb/>
            ov. In V. it is <foreign xml:lang="grc">τοῦ</foreign>, and Bentley had <lb/>
            already proposed <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐκ ἔστι</foreign> TO <foreign xml:lang="grc">τέρας τοῦ</foreign>.</p>
          <p>47. <foreign xml:lang="grc">αἰνίττεται</foreign> MSS. vulgo. This being <lb/>
            the Attic form, Dobree proposed <foreign xml:lang="grc">αἰνἰσσε</foreign>- <lb/>
            TaL, which is approved by Dindorf in <lb/>
            his notes and read by Holden, Meineke, <lb/>
            and most subsequent editors. But in <lb/>
            using an alien dialect Aristophanes was <lb/>
            never careful to make it strictly accurate.</p>
          <p>48. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀναιδέως</foreign> R. V. Bekker, Dindorf, <lb/>
            Bothe, Holden, recentiores, except Her­ <lb/>
            werden and Merry, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀναιδῶς</foreign> the other <lb/>
            MSS. and all other editions before <lb/>
            Bothe's second. Bentley proposed <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀνέ­ <lb/>
            δην</foreign>, and Elmsley (at Ach. 178) <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἡδέως</foreign>, <lb/>
            omitting <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὴν</foreign>. In omitting <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὴν</foreign> he is <lb/>
            followed by Dindorf, Bothe, and Green. <lb/>
            But <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀναιδὲω</foreign>s is practically a trisyllable, <lb/>
            the epsilon here, as frequently elsewhere, <lb/>
            coalescing with the following vowel; <lb/>
            see Appendix to Lys. 63, and compare <lb/>
            Lys. 734 <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀλλ ἐῶ 'πολέσθαι τἄρια</foreign>, and such <lb/>
            words as <foreign xml:lang="grc">πόλεως</foreign>. The notion that <foreign xml:lang="grc">κεῖνος</foreign> <lb/>
            is Cleon has given rise to some singular <lb/>
            conjectures. Van Leeuwen in a maga­ <lb/>
            zine article (A.D. 1887) proposed to read <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐν 'Αίδεω</foreign>, and this is done by Herwerden <lb/>
            and Merry. Then it was necessary to <lb/>
            explain the meaning of <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὴν σπατίλην</foreign>. <lb/>
            Van Leeuwen thought it referred to the <lb/>
            filthy hides of the tannery ; Herwerden <lb/>
            (with whom Dr. Merry agrees) to the <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">σκῶρ ἀείνων</foreign> in which Cleon was presum­ <lb/>
            ably plunged in Hades. The notion <lb/>
            that the Ionian is pronouncing dogmati­ <lb/>
            cally as to what Cleon was doing in <lb/>
            the world below seems to me not comic <lb/>
            but ridiculous; and the idea that he is <lb/>
            engaged in eating the dung by which <lb/>
            he is supposed to be surrounded is not <lb/>
            merely ridiculous but repulsive. Neither <lb/>
            idea could have entered into the mind <lb/>
            of Aristophanes. And in fact Van <lb/>
            Leeuwen in his edition of the Play <lb/>
            (A.D. 1906), having come to the con­ <lb/>
            clusion that <foreign xml:lang="grc">κεῖνος</foreign> is the beetle, reverts <lb/>
            to the ordinary reading and the ordi­ <lb/>
            nary interpretation; and Herwerden, <lb/>
            though he still thinks that the words <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὡς κεῖνος</foreign> refer to Clean, agrees that the <lb/>
            rest of the line is spoken of the beetle; <lb/>
            "Like Cleon, the beetle eats muck in <lb/>
            a shameless manner." This seems pro­ <lb/>
            bable enough. Another difficulty in <lb/>
            referring the entire line to Cleon arises <lb/>
            from the present tense <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐσθίει</foreign> which, the <lb/>
            Scholiast says, is used for <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἤσθιεν</foreign>. Brunck <lb/>
            proposed to read <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἤσθιεν</foreign>, and Paulmier <lb/>
            and Dobree <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἔσθιεν</foreign>, which Blaydes intro­ <lb/>

            which have done so much harm to the <lb/>
            text of Aristophanes. Veitch, who in his <lb/>
            " Greek Verbs" showed it to be erro­ <lb/>
            neous, trusted according to Dr. Ruther­ <lb/>
            ford (New Pbrynichus, § 234) too impli­ <lb/>
            citly to the authority of the MSS; in <lb/>
            other words, he preferred to rely on the <lb/>
            facts rather than on the theory which <lb/>
            the facts disproved. Facts were abhor­ <lb/>
            rent to Cobet, " Errant omnes," he says, <lb/>
            "Sophistae, Rbetores, Magistri." An <lb/>
            investigator who works in this spirit is <lb/>
            little likely to arrive at the truth. The <lb/>
            truth could be more briefly stated in two <lb/>
            words " Errat Cobetus." But I too have <lb/>
            a little bone to pick with the old Gram­ <lb/>
            marians. Instead of saying that such a <lb/>
            form as <foreign xml:lang="grc">καταγορεύσῃ</foreign> is the aorist sub­ <lb/>
            junctive, and that there is no future <lb/>
            subjunctive, I wish that they had de­ <lb/>
            scribed it as both the aorist and the future <lb/>
            subjunctive. Cobet's error is followed <lb/>

            the two sentences which they introduce <lb/>
            are not contrasted, but practically iden­ <lb/>
            tical. See Lys. 262,263 and Thesm. 352, <lb/>

            said "Qu. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἁίερίων</foreign>,i.e. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀνθρωπείων</foreign>." He <lb/>
            meant <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἡμερίων</foreign>, but used the form familiar <lb/>
            in the Choral Odes of Tragedy. How­ <lb/>
            ever <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἡμερίων</foreign> could not possibly be equi­ <lb/>
            valent to <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀνθρωπείων</foreign>. The word means, <lb/>
            like <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐφήμερος</foreign>,lasting for a day; and <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἡμέριοι</foreign>, like <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐφήμεροι</foreign>, is used to signify <lb/>

            would mean not human food but food <lb/>
            lasting only for a day. Nevertheless the <lb/>
            MS. reading is ignored, and <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἡμἐρίων</foreign> sub­ <lb/>
            stituted for it, by Herwerden, Hall and <lb/>

            <foreign xml:lang="grc">Πειραιεῖ</foreign> Brunck, recentiores, except as <lb/>
            aforesaid, so that many who gave <foreign xml:lang="grc">πειραεῖ</foreign> <lb/>
            in 145 supra give <foreign xml:lang="grc">Πειραιεῖ</foreign> here. This <lb/>
            must, I think, be due partly to the cir­ <lb/>
            cumstance that, according to Bekker, V. <lb/>
            has <foreign xml:lang="grc">πειραεῖ</foreign> there and <foreign xml:lang="grc">Πειραιεῖ</foreign> here. <lb/>
            But Bekker was quite wrong ; V. has <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">Πειραεῖ</foreign> in both places. And partly to <lb/>
            the fact that the penultimate is short <lb/>
            there and long here ; but the length of <lb/>
            the syllable cannot depend upon the <lb/>
            presence or absence of the iota.</p>

            but that phrase involves an idea of mo­ <lb/>

            suggested <foreign xml:lang="grc">στρέφει</foreign>, and Cobet (Novae <lb/>
            Lect. p. 106), with his usual assurance, <lb/>
            takes upon himself to announce that <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">στροφεῖ</foreign> is a barbarism. <foreign xml:lang="grc">στροφέω</foreign> is no <lb/>
            more a barbarism than <foreign xml:lang="grc">φορέω</foreign>.The re­ <lb/>
            lation of the former word to <foreign xml:lang="grc">στρέφω</foreign> is <lb/>
            identical with that of the latter word to <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">φέρω</foreign>. However the prosaic <foreign xml:lang="grc">στρέφει</foreign> is <lb/>
            introduced into the text by Meineke, <lb/>
            who is followed by Holden, Blaydes, <lb/>

            me that the middle is required, the <lb/>

            MS. reading, refers to Wasps 155, Frogs <lb/>

            Suidas, s. vv. <foreign xml:lang="grc">μιαροὶ</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">τολμῆσαι</foreign>. But <lb/>
            in Kuster's edition of Suidas, s. v. <foreign xml:lang="grc">μιαροὶ</foreign>, <lb/>
            the line was made to commence <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὦ βδε­ <lb/>

            and a reminiscence of Frogs 465. Per­ <lb/>

            but of couise did not recommend its <lb/>
            adoption here. Yet Dindorf actually <lb/>
            introduced it into his text, and what is <lb/>
            still more strange, this ridiculous error <lb/>
            is followed by almost every subsequent <lb/>
            editor, even after Gaisford, in his edition <lb/>
            of Suidas, had struck out <foreign xml:lang="grc">βδελυρὲ</foreign> and <lb/>
            restored <foreign xml:lang="grc">μιαρὲ</foreign> from the MSS. Bothe <lb/>

            a, number of really nonsensical con­ <lb/>

            (since Pylus bad been taken long ago), <lb/>
            but so like one of Cobet's that it is not <lb/>
            surprising to find Cobet applauding it <lb/>
            as " verissimum," N. L. p. 204, and <lb/>
            Blaydes brings it into the text. Kock <lb/>

            Such alterations as these seem to go <lb/>

            and the preceding line are in the <lb/>
            punctuation rather than in the words, <lb/>
            the question being whether each line <lb/>
            is to be taken as an independent sen­ <lb/>
            tence, or whether <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἄσον κακὸν</foreign> is to govern <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">τοῦ πλάτους</foreign> as well as <foreign xml:lang="grc">τοῦ βλέμματος</foreign>, or <lb/>
            to be considered parenthetical. On <lb/>
            this point there is great diversity both <lb/>
            in the MSS. and in the editions, some <lb/>
            punctuating after <foreign xml:lang="grc">πλάταυς</foreign>, some after <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">κακὸν</foreign>, and some after both words. The <lb/>
            ordinary Aristopbanic usage seems <lb/>
            greatly in favour of taking line 238 as <lb/>
            an independent sentence; <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὦναξ῎ Απολλον, <lb/>

            says “Perspicue legendum <foreign xml:lang="grc">τρὶς ἄθλιαι</foreign>.” <lb/>
            And this is followed by Bothe and some <lb/>
            others but not generally. And see <lb/>

            Zacher, and Graves afterwards. But <lb/>
            Bentley, objecting probably both to the <lb/>
            use of <foreign xml:lang="grc">τρίψομαι</foreign> in a purely passive <lb/>
            sense, and to the rhythm of the line, <lb/>
            proposed <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὦ Μέγαρα</foreign> with <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπιτριβήσεσθ᾽</foreign>; <lb/>
            while for the latter word Elmsley <lb/>
            proposed <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπιτετρίψεσθ᾽</foreign>. And <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὦ</foreign> Me'yapa <lb/>
            was subsequently found to be the <lb/>
            reading of R. V. (though they also have <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπιτρίψεσθ᾽</foreign>, making the line a syllable <lb/>
            short, and so Invernizzi); whilst the <lb/>
            Scholiast on R. has <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπιτετρίψεσθ᾽</foreign>. Ac­ <lb/>
            cordingly there has been a general <lb/>
            acquiescence in Bentley's <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὦ Μέγαρα</foreign> and <lb/>
            Elmsley’s <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπιτετρίψεσθ᾽</foreign>. It is difficult <lb/>
            to say whether the fact that War's <lb/>
            other denunciations commence with <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἰὼ</foreign> <lb/>
            is in favour of, or against, the same <lb/>
            commencement here.</p>

            read in my previous edition, observing <lb/>
            that " <unclear>oἷ</unclear> <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἡ</foreign> might easily be mistaken <lb/>
            for <foreign xml:lang="grc">οἵη</foreign> and so become converted into <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">οἵα</foreign>.” Harpocration indeed, a. v. <foreign xml:lang="grc">Κεῖοι</foreign>, <lb/>
            does read <foreign xml:lang="grc">οἷα. οἵα</foreign> MSS. vulgo. Meineke <lb/>
             <pb n="190"/>
            reads olaf, with which however <foreign xml:lang="grc">πάλις</foreign> <lb/>
            would require the article. The MSS. ' <lb/>
            and early editions continue the line to <lb/>
            War, but Dobree's proposal to transfer <lb/>
            it to Trygaeus is obviously right, and is <lb/>
            now universally accepted.</p>
          <p>253. <foreign xml:lang="grc">χρῆσθἀτέρῳ</foreign>. The MSS. read <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">χρῆσθαι θἀτέρῳ</foreign>, making the line a <lb/>
            syllable too long. All editions before <lb/>
            Brunck rectified the metre by omitting <lb/>
            orai, which all the MSS. read. And so <lb/>
            (after Brunck) Bothe, Weise, and Rich­ <lb/>
            ter. '' At locum hie habere non potest <lb/>

            And so, or as Bekker wrote it, <foreign xml:lang="grc">χρῆσθἀ­ <lb/>

            aforesaid.</p>
          <p>254. <foreign xml:lang="grc">τετρώβαλον</foreign> MSS. vulgo. Dindorf <lb/>
            suggested <foreign xml:lang="grc">τετρωβόλσυ</foreign>, which is read by <lb/>
            Holden, Meineke, Richter, Green, and <lb/>
            Paley.</p>
          <p>257. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὡς δριμύς</foreign>. In the editions before <lb/>
            Bekker these two words were continued <lb/>
            to War. But Bentley proposed to trans­ <lb/>
            fer them to Riot, and this is now found <lb/>
            to be the arrangement in R. V., and is <lb/>
            followed by Bekker and others. <lb/>
            Hermann however proposed to transfer <lb/>
            them and the whole of the following <lb/>
            line (changing <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐνέβαλες</foreign> into <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐνέβαλεν</foreign>) to <lb/>
            Trygaeus, and this is followed by <lb/>
            Dindorf and others. It seems to me <lb/>
            that the MS. arrangement, which I <lb/>
            have retained, is in every respect better <lb/>
            than Hermann's.</p>
          <p>259. <foreign xml:lang="grc">αἴσεις</foreign> MSS. vulgo. Dobree on <lb/>
            Clouds 633 said " Qu. <unclear>oἶσ᾽</unclear> <foreign xml:lang="grc">οἶσ᾽</foreign>,” an un­ <lb/>
            fortunate suggestion, which he did <lb/>
            not repeat when he came to the Peace. <lb/>
            It is however adopted by Meineke, <lb/>
            Holden, and Blaydes.</p>

            editions before Brunck. Since Inver­ <lb/>
            nizzi all editions have adopted <foreign xml:lang="grc">᾽Αθηναίων</foreign>. <lb/>
            But according to the rule invented by <lb/>
            Dawes (at Plutus 166) the second <lb/>
            syllable of <foreign xml:lang="grc">μεταθρέξει</foreign> should be short; <lb/>
            and editors from Brunck downwards, <lb/>
            except as aforesaid, have sought to re­ <lb/>
            model the line so as to bring it into <lb/>
            conformity with this rule. Brunck <lb/>
            inserted <foreign xml:lang="grc">σὺ</foreign> before <foreign xml:lang="grc">μεταθρέξει</foreign>, and this <lb/>
            is followed by Bekker, Bergk, Van <lb/>
            Leeuwen, and others ; Elmsley (at Ach. <lb/>
            759) proposed to read’<foreign xml:lang="grc">Αθηναίοισι</foreign> subaud. <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὄντα</foreign> ; Dobree proposed to change raxv <lb/>
            into <foreign xml:lang="grc">ταχὺ πάνυ</foreign>, and this is done by <lb/>
            Meineke, Herwerden, Hall and Geldart <lb/>
            and others; Dindorf inserted <foreign xml:lang="grc">γε</foreign> before <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">μεταθρέξει</foreign>, and so Bothe, Richter, and <lb/>
            others, and Blaydes reads <foreign xml:lang="grc">τινὰ</foreign> TaxO. <lb/>
            But rules, so purely empirical as this, <lb/>
            however useful as showing the general <lb/>
            leaning of the Comic Writers, and the <lb/>
            airiness and vivacity which they strove <lb/>
            to infuse into their metres, become <lb/>
            positively mischievous when they are <lb/>
            elevated into Draconian laws which <lb/>
            must be strictly enforced against any <lb/>
            amount of opposing evidence. The <lb/>
            enormous number of passages (some, <lb/>
            but not all of which are collected by <lb/>
            Kidd in his notes on Dawes, and by <lb/>
            Mitchell in his Note H to the Wasps), in <lb/>
            which a perfectly simple and unsuspi­ <lb/>
            cious text has been vexed and worried <lb/>
            into a reluctant conformity with this <lb/>
            supposed rule, is at least sufficient to <lb/>
             <pb n="191"/>
            show that the rule, if it existed at all, <lb/>
            admitted of abundant exceptions. It is <lb/>
            not suggested that the rule applies to <lb/>
            any but the comic poets, and it seems <lb/>
            to savour strongly of the watertight <lb/>
            compartment theory ; see on 32 supra.</p>
          <p>262. <foreign xml:lang="grc">εἰ δὲ μή γε, κλαύσομαι</foreign> MSS. vulgo. <lb/>
            Meineke substitutes <unclear>γὼ</unclear> for <foreign xml:lang="grc">γε</foreign> and is <lb/>
            followed by Holden. Richter reads <foreign xml:lang="grc">εἰ <lb/>
            δὲ μὴ</foreign>— <foreign xml:lang="grc">ΠΟΛ. κεκλαύσεται. Κεκλαύσαμαι</foreign> <lb/>

            reading in all editions before Bothe and <lb/>
            Bekker. The iota in <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀλετρίβανος</foreign> was <lb/>

            before Bekker; and Bergk afterwards. <lb/>
            Richter too keeps this reading, but <lb/>
            changes the preceding <foreign xml:lang="grc">καὶ</foreign> into KOV, which <lb/>
            Meineke approves in his V. A.; Mazon <lb/>
            also retains it but takes <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀρχήσεσθ᾽</foreign> to be <lb/>
            the infinitive future. <foreign xml:lang="grc">μηδὲν ὀρχήσησθ᾽ ἔτι</foreign> <lb/>
            Bekker, recentiores, except as aforesaid. <lb/>
            But the future indicative is sometimes, <lb/>
            though rarely, found with <foreign xml:lang="grc">μὴ</foreign> or <foreign xml:lang="grc">μηδὲν</foreign>, <lb/>
            as in Plutus 488 <foreign xml:lang="grc">μαλακὸν</foreign> 8' <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐνδώσετε μη­ <lb/>

            it here, with the evidence of every MS. <lb/>
            in its favour.</p>
          <p>344. <foreign xml:lang="grc">συβαρίζειν</foreign> MSS. vulgo. The first <lb/>
            syllable of the verb is long, and the first <lb/>
            syllable of <foreign xml:lang="grc">Σύβαρις</foreign> (the city) is short, <lb/>
            Wasps 1259,1427,1435 ; but it is doubt­ <lb/>
            ful if the two words are really connected, <lb/>
            though assumed to be so in after times ; <lb/>
            and indeed it is not uncommon for <lb/>
            poets to adapt the quantity of proper <lb/>
            names to suit their own metrical exi­ <lb/>
            gencies. The existence of various forms <lb/>
            of the verb, <foreign xml:lang="grc">συβαριάζειν, συμβαρίζειν, <lb/>
            συβριάζειν</foreign>, is of itself sufficient to cast <lb/>
            some doubt upon the derivation from <lb/>

              Graec. Corn. vol. v. 41 (published in <lb/>
              1857), having regard to the word <foreign xml:lang="grc">συβα­ <lb/>
              ριασμὸς</foreign> in the line of Phrynichus, pro­ <lb/>
              posed <foreign xml:lang="grc">συβαριάζειν</foreign>, but in his edition of <lb/>
              the Play (published in 1860) he ignored <lb/>
              that suggestion and actually read <lb/>
              <foreign xml:lang="grc">πυδαρίζειν</foreign>, to which he adhered in the <lb/>
              Vind. Aristoph. (published in 1865). <lb/>
              <foreign xml:lang="grc">πυδαρίζειν</foreign> is, as Mr. Sharpley says, a <lb/>
              worthless suggestion, and is adopted <lb/>
              only by Van Leeuwen. <foreign xml:lang="grc">συβριάζειν</foreign>, Green, <lb/>
              Mazon. The despised <foreign xml:lang="grc">συβαριάζειν</foreign> was <lb/>
              however rescued from its obscurity and <lb/>
              brought into the text by Blaydes, who is <lb/>
              followed by Herwerden, Sharpley, <lb/>
              Zacher, and Graves.</p>
          <p>346-60. This little system is re­ <lb/>
            peated, with exact metrical concordance, <lb/>
            infra 385-99 and again infra 582-600. <lb/>
            I will here set out the scheme, which <lb/>
            in the earlier edition was given in the <lb/>
            Introduction :- <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BELL_08_fig231.jpg"/></figure> <pb n="193"/>
              <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BELL_08_fig232.jpg"/></figure></p>
          <p>In drawing out the scheme in the <lb/>
            former edition I did not make sufficient <lb/>
            allowance for the extreme frequency <lb/>
            with which the final syllable of a <lb/>
            cretic ending a line is found to be short, <lb/>
            so that the cretic really becomes a dac­ <lb/>
            tyl. For example in the eight cretico- <lb/>
            paeonic lines relating to the sons of <lb/>
            Automenes (Wasps 1275-82) this ter­ <lb/>
            mination occurs in four consecutive <lb/>
            lines, and perhaps more frequently <lb/>
            still, though not so continuously in any <lb/>
            one passage, in the Acharnians. It will <lb/>
            be seen that the system of seventeen lines <lb/>
            is composed of twelve cretico-paeonic <lb/>
            lines, all dimeters except the last which <lb/>
            is a trimeter, three trochaic tetrameters <lb/>
            catalectic, one iambic dimeter, and one <lb/>
            consisting of a trochaic dimeter followed <lb/>
            by a cretic dimeter. The last-mentioned <lb/>
            line is the first of the system, and is <lb/>
            the only line about the metre of which <lb/>
            there is any conceivable doubt; some <lb/>
            making it a trochaic tetrameter, and <lb/>
            others treating it as half trochaic and <lb/>
            half cretic, as it was given in the intro­ <lb/>
            duction to my former edition and now <lb/>
            appears in my text. Not a single MS. <lb/>
            gives the line in either of the three <lb/>
            systems as a trochaic tetrameter : one <lb/>
            gives it in one case exactly as in the <lb/>
            text, and the reading of the others <lb/>
            point to the same conclusion.</p>
          <p>346. <foreign xml:lang="grc">εἰ γὰρ ἐκγένοιτ᾽ ἰδεῑν ταύτην με τὴν <lb/>
            ἡμέραν</foreign>. This is the reading of R. except <lb/>
            that R. adds <foreign xml:lang="grc">ποτὲ</foreign>, a word that has <lb/>
            probably crept in from some marginal <lb/>
            gloss. It will perhaps make the matter <lb/>
            clearer if we divide the line into two <lb/>
            sections: (1) <foreign xml:lang="grc">εἰ</foreign> yap <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐκγένοιτ᾽ ἰδει̃ν</foreign> R. <lb/>
            Invernizzi, recentiores. For <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐκγένοιτ᾽</foreign> V. <lb/>
            has <foreign xml:lang="grc">γένοιτο</foreign>, I. P2- <foreign xml:lang="grc">γένοιτ᾽</foreign>, while P1. fills <lb/>
            up the gap left in these latter readings <lb/>
            by giving <foreign xml:lang="grc">μοι γένοιτ᾽</foreign>, and so all editions be­ <lb/>
            fore Brunck who reads <foreign xml:lang="grc">εἴθε μοι ταύτην ἰδει̃ν</foreign>. <lb/>
            (2) <foreign xml:lang="grc">ταύτην με τὴν ἡμέραν ποτέ</foreign> R. V. 1. P2. <lb/>
            Invernizzi, Bekker. Pl. having inserted <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">μοι</foreign> in the first section, omits <foreign xml:lang="grc">με</foreign> here, <lb/>
            reading <foreign xml:lang="grc">ταύτην τὴν ἡμέραν ποτέ</foreign>. And so <lb/>
            all editions before Brunck (who reads <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">γένοιτό ποτε τὴν ἡμέραν</foreign>), and Weise after­ <lb/>
            wards. Since Bekker three different <lb/>
            readings have prevailed. Person pro­ <lb/>
            posed <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὴν ἡμέραν ταύτην ποτέ</foreign>, and this is <lb/>
            followed by Meineke, Blaydes, and <lb/>
            Mazon. Dindorf proposed <foreign xml:lang="grc">ταύτην μέ <lb/>
            ποτε τὴν ἡμέραν</foreign>, which is followed by <lb/>
            Bothe, Green, and Paley. Bergk simply <lb/>
            struck away the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ποτὲ</foreign> from R.'s reading, <lb/>
            and this 1 followed in the introduction <note type="footnote"> PEACE </note> <note type="footnote"> 0 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="194"/>
            to my former edition; and, save as <lb/>
            aforesaid, it is adopted by all editors <lb/>
            subsequent to Bergk.</p>

          <p>382. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὦρμίδιαν</foreign> MSS. vulgo. Dindorf <lb/>
            is said to have suggested <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὦρμήδιον</foreign> (I do <lb/>
            not know where he did so), and this <lb/>
            appears to he the correct reading in <lb/>
            Lucian's Contemplantes 1. Schwabe <lb/>
            proposed <foreign xml:lang="grc">Ἑρμῄδιον</foreign>. But the first to <lb/>
            alter the text was Blaydes who read <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">Ἑρμείδιον</foreign>. His particular alteration has <lb/>
            not been followed, but his example in <lb/>
            altering the text has been followed by <lb/>
            all subsequent editors except Merry and <lb/>
            Mazon ; Herwerden adopting Schwabe's <lb/>
            proposal, and the others following in his <lb/>
            train. See the Commentary.</p>
          <p>385. <foreign xml:lang="grc">μηδαμῶς μηδαμῶς</foreign> V. Bergk, and <lb/>
            all the editors who in line 346 read <lb/>
            ratify <foreign xml:lang="grc">με τὴν ἡμέραν. μὴ μηδαμῶς μηδαμῶς</foreign> <lb/>
            R.I. Invernizzi. I imagine that in this <lb/>
            reading the first <foreign xml:lang="grc">μὴ</foreign> is merely a duplicate <lb/>
            of the last syllable of <foreign xml:lang="grc">Ἑρμῆ</foreign> which <lb/>
            immediately precedes. <foreign xml:lang="grc">μὴ μηδαμῶς μὴ <lb/>

            they object to Trap' <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐμοῦ</foreign>, from me, as my <lb/>
            gift, which is obviously right.</p>
          <p>389. <foreign xml:lang="grc">νόμιζ᾽ ἐν τῳ̑δε τῳ̑ νῦν πράγματι</foreign> <lb/>
            Bentley, Hall and Geldart. <foreign xml:lang="grc">νομίζων ἐν <lb/>
            τῳ̑δε τῳ̑ πράγατι</foreign> MSS., editions before <lb/>
            Brunck; and Invernizzi, Bothe, and <lb/>
            Beaker afterwards. Brunck wrote <foreign xml:lang="grc">κεῖνο <lb/>
            μὴ φαῦλον νομίζων τουτῳὶ Τῳ̑</foreign> 7rpay<foreign xml:lang="grc">ματι</foreign>. <lb/>
            Dindorf, combining the suggestions of <lb/>
            Bentley and Brunck, gave <foreign xml:lang="grc">νόμιζ ἐν <lb/>
            τουτῳὶ</foreign> T6 <foreign xml:lang="grc">πράγματι</foreign>, observing that the <lb/>
            words <foreign xml:lang="grc">τουτῳὶ τῳ̑ πρέγματι</foreign> occur in Lys. <lb/>
            615. And this has been almost univer­ <lb/>
            sally followed, though it departs far <lb/>
            more widely than Bentley's proposal <lb/>
            from the MS. reading. But Bergk and <lb/>
            one or two others end the line (as the <lb/>
            first line of the system) with two cretics <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">νόμιζ᾽ ἐν τῳ̑δε τῳ̑ πράγματι</foreign>, and Meineke <lb/>
            writes <foreign xml:lang="grc">νομίζων ἐν τοιούτῳ πράγματι</foreign> </p>
          <p>390. <foreign xml:lang="grc">μηδ᾽ ἔχε ... ἐμαι̃σι</foreign>. See the Com­ <lb/>

            ἡμῖν</foreign> MSS. vulgo, though all editions <lb/>
            before Invernizzi add <foreign xml:lang="grc">τις</foreign> after <foreign xml:lang="grc">παλίγκοτος</foreign> <lb/>
            and ye after <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἡμῖν</foreign>. Brunck twists the <lb/>
            MS. reading into a trochaic tetrameter <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἡμὶν ἐντιβολοῦιν, ὦναξ, μὴ γένῃπαλίγκοτος</foreign>, <lb/>
            and Richter into two trochaic dimeters <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">μὴ γένῃ παλίγκοτος προσκυναῦντί μοί σ</foreign>, <lb/>
            aVaE, but otherwise the MS. reading is <lb/>
            left untouched, as incurably corrupted. <lb/>
            Of course in my reading <foreign xml:lang="grc">παλίγκοτος</foreign> <lb/>
            might be read for <foreign xml:lang="grc">παλιγκότως</foreign>, but the <lb/>
            adverb is more usual.</p>
          <p>402. <foreign xml:lang="grc">κλέπται τε</foreign> yap <foreign xml:lang="grc">νῦν εἰσι μα̑λλον</foreign>. So <lb/>
            I read in the former edition, following <lb/>
            V., except that, with I. and P2., I wrote <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">εἰσι μα̑λλον</foreign> for <foreign xml:lang="grc">μα̑λλάν εἰσι</foreign>, so as to bring <lb/>
            the termination of the present line into <lb/>
            more exact conformity with that of its <lb/>
            predecessor; and so now Zacher reads. <lb/>
            R. omits the line, no doubt owing to the <lb/>
            similarity of termination, but some <lb/>
            corrector has written in the margin V.'s <lb/>
            reading rendered unmetrical by the <lb/>
            omission of <foreign xml:lang="grc">τε. κλέπται τε γὰρ νῦν μα̑λλον <lb/>

            <foreign xml:lang="grc">κλέπται τὰ νῦν γάρ εἰσι μα̑λλον</foreign>, which is <lb/>
            adopted by Van Leeuwen and Graves; <lb/>
            then, in his V. A., he altered <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὰ</foreign> vvv <foreign xml:lang="grc">γὰρ</foreign> <lb/>
            into <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὰ γὰρ νῦν</foreign> which Green follows.</p>

            Bentley however suggested <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἁμαρτωλίας</foreign>, <lb/>
            which is read by Bergk, Meineke, <lb/>
            Holden, Herwerden, and subsequent <lb/>
            editors except Mazon and Zacher ; but <lb/>
            which seems to me simply to destroy <lb/>
            a characteristic jest.</p>

            account of the anomalous position of <lb/>

            δὲ ξυναέλκυσον</foreign> or <foreign xml:lang="grc">συνεξέλκυσον</foreign>, and <lb/>
            some have adopted <foreign xml:lang="grc">ξυναέλκυσον</foreign> with <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">τήνδε</foreign> Kal. Meineke changed <foreign xml:lang="grc">τήνδε</foreign> into <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">τω̑νδε</foreign>, a very improbable reading, but <lb/>
            adopted by Herwerden, Sharpley, and <lb/>
            Zacher.</p>
          <p>420. <foreign xml:lang="grc">Διπολίει᾽</foreign>. With Zacher I have <lb/>
            adopted Mr. Sharpley's spelling of this <lb/>
            word, which is so spelled in inscriptions <lb/>
            and in the Lexicon Sangerman, Bekker's <lb/>
            Anecd. p. 91, and which corresponds <lb/>
            with the <foreign xml:lang="grc">Διπολιώδη</foreign> of Clouds 984. <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">Διιπόλει᾽</foreign> MSS., all editions before Bothe <lb/>
            and Bekker, and one or two afterwards. <lb/>
            Person objected to <foreign xml:lang="grc">Διιπόλει᾽</foreign> and proposed <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">Διπόλει᾽</foreign>, which is read by Bothe and <lb/>
            Bekker and almost all subsequent <lb/>
            editors.</p>
          <p>421. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἅλλαι</foreign>. The aspirate, proposed by <lb/>
            Bergk, is added by Meineke, Blaydes, <lb/>
            Herwerden, Van Leeuwen, Zacher, and <lb/>
            Graves. But even without the aspirate <lb/>
            there was never any doubt as to the <lb/>
            meaning of the line. "Tum civitates <lb/>

            tricacies of the Athenian theatre to <lb/>
            understand precisely what the Chorus <lb/>
            are directedto do ; but there is no need <lb/>
            of such idle conjectures as Bachmann's <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">εἶ᾽ ἰόντες</foreign> (which Herwerden introduces <lb/>
            into the text), or Kock's <foreign xml:lang="grc">εἶα πάντες</foreign>. And <lb/>
            we must remember that, as a rule, the <lb/>
            action of the Chorus is restricted to <lb/>
            songs, dances, and gesticulations in the <lb/>
            orchestra.</p>

            The apostrophe was added by Bentley <lb/>

            to me a complete mistake. Trygaeus <lb/>
            is not stating a fact, but exhorting to <lb/>
            prayer. <foreign xml:lang="grc">μεσθα</foreign>, Let its pray, was the <lb/>
            regular form. It is used again infra 973.</p>
          <p>439. ye <foreign xml:lang="grc">διάγειν</foreign>. This I proposed in <lb/>
            my former edition. The MSS. (except <lb/>
            Pl.) have simply <foreign xml:lang="grc">διάγειν</foreign> (without <foreign xml:lang="grc">γε</foreign>). Pl. <lb/>
            has Stayer <foreign xml:lang="grc">με</foreign>, and so all editions before <lb/>
            Dindorf. Dindorf proposed <foreign xml:lang="grc">διάξειν</foreign>, which <lb/>
            is followed by Weise, Green, and Blaydes. <lb/>
            Lenting proposed <foreign xml:lang="grc">διαγαει̑ν</foreign>, which is fol­ <lb/>
            lowed by Bergk, and, save as aforesaid, <lb/>
            all subsequent editors. Boissonade pro­ <lb/>
            posed <foreign xml:lang="grc">διάγειν γε</foreign>. It seems to me that <lb/>
            Stayer is right: compare Wasps 1006, <lb/>
            where Bdelycleon promises to take his <lb/>
            father to dinners, wine-parties, and public <lb/>
            spectacles <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὣσθ᾽ ἡδέως διάγειν σε τὸν λοιπὸν <lb/>
            χράναν</foreign>. But the ye should here come <lb/>
            after <foreign xml:lang="grc">εἰρήνῃ</foreign>, not after <foreign xml:lang="grc">διάγειν</foreign>.</p>
          <p>441. The Scholiast says <foreign xml:lang="grc">δύα πρόσωπα</foreign> <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BELL_08_fig233.jpg"/></figure> <lb/>
              take him to mean that the preceding <lb/>
              six lines have been a prayer for blessing, <lb/>
              but that now we come to a series of im­ <lb/>
              precations which he supposes to have <lb/>
              been invoked by a different speaker. <lb/>
              Dobree however, quite misunderstand­ <lb/>
              ing, as it seems to me, the Scholiast's <lb/>
              observation, divides the triplets which <lb/>
              follow into two sections, giving to <lb/>
              Trygaeus merely the description of <lb/>
              an objectionable person, and then making <lb/>
              the Chorus take the words out of his <lb/>
              mouth, and declare that person's fate. <lb/>
              Thus he arranges the first triplet in this <lb/>
              way : TP. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὅστις δὲ πόλεμον μα̑λλον εἶναι</foreign> <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BELL_08_fig234.jpg"/></figure> <lb/>
              <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐξαιραύμεναν</foreign>. And so on with the others : <lb/>
              so that Trygaeus is never allowed to <lb/>
              finish his sentence. This seems to me <lb/>
              supremely ridiculous, and it cannot be <lb/>
              what the Scholiast meant, for under this <lb/>
              arrangement Trygaeus never <foreign xml:lang="grc">εὔχεται</foreign>, the <lb/>
              Chorus does that for him. Yet no less <lb/>
              than five editors-Richter, Herwerden, <lb/>
              Mazon, Sharpley, and Graves-have <lb/>
              followed Dobree's mistake.</p>

            seems to have been suggested by Dindorf <lb/>
            in some earlier edition, and it is adopted <lb/>
            by Bekker and all subsequent editors <lb/>

            <foreign xml:lang="grc">τροχὸς</foreign>) vulgo. Here, as in Knights 805, <lb/>
            the weight of authority in favour of the <lb/>
            combination of <foreign xml:lang="grc">εἰ</foreign> with the subjunctive <lb/>
            is so great that it cannot reasonably be <lb/>
            rejected. And it seems certain that <lb/>
            Aristophanes occasionally used <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἢν</foreign> with <lb/>
             <pb n="197"/>
            the optative and el with the subjunctive. <lb/>

            805, Birds 1240, Plutus 217, and infra <lb/>

            easy to change <foreign xml:lang="grc">κεἰ</foreign> into <foreign xml:lang="grc">κἢν</foreign> or <foreign xml:lang="grc">ξυμμάβῃ</foreign> <lb/>
            into <foreign xml:lang="grc">ξυλλάβ</foreign>p<foreign xml:lang="grc">ι</foreign>. And indeed the former <lb/>
            change was made by Brunck and Bothe, <lb/>
            while the latter was suggested (though <lb/>
            not adopted) by Meineke, and made by <lb/>

            substitutes a lacuna for <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὦγαθὲ</foreign>, in which <lb/>
            he is followed by Green. Bothe, who <lb/>

            Paley, Blaydes, and Merry. Meineke, <lb/>
            not observing that the line is dactylic, <lb/>

            of authority therefore in these passages <lb/>

            Musuro, as so often in this Play, adopted <lb/>
            the alteration of P1., and so all editors <lb/>
            before Bekker, Bentley however sug­ <lb/>
            gesting that <foreign xml:lang="grc">μικρὸν κινου̑μέν γ</foreign>’ should be <lb/>
            read for <foreign xml:lang="grc">μικρόν γε κινου̑μεν</foreign>, and Brunch <lb/>
            and Bothe so reading. The intruding <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὦ εἶα, ὦ εἶα</foreign> was first ejected by Bekker, <lb/>
            on the authority of R. V., and save in <lb/>
            Weise and Bothe's second edition has <lb/>
            never appeared again. Bekker, wrongly <lb/>
            I think, left a blank after <foreign xml:lang="grc">δεινὸν</foreign>, and <lb/>
            all subsequent editors have assumed that <lb/>
            the missing half-line should come there; <lb/>
            and some have proposed, and some in­ <lb/>
            serted, a form of words to fill the gap. <lb/>
            Thus Dindorf proposed <foreign xml:lang="grc">δη̑τα τόδ</foreign>’ <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐστίν</foreign>; <lb/>
            which Graves reads; Bergk, <foreign xml:lang="grc">δη̑τα τόδ</foreign>’ <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὑμω̑ν</foreign>, which Herwerden reads: Holden <lb/>
            proposed <foreign xml:lang="grc">καὶ δεινότατον</foreign>. Richter reads <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">του̑τ</foreign>’ <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἔστ</foreign>’ <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὦνδρες</foreign>; Blaydes, <foreign xml:lang="grc">δη̑τ</foreign>’ <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐστ</foreign>’ <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὦνδρες</foreign>; Merry, <foreign xml:lang="grc">κἄτοπον, ὑμω̑ν</foreign> ; Sharpley, <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">κἄτοπόν</foreign> ; and Van Leeuwen, <foreign xml:lang="grc">του̑τ</foreign>’ <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἔστ</foreign>’ <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἤδη</foreign>. It seems to me, however, that <lb/>
            the blank really comes after <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀντισπα̑ν</foreign>, <lb/>
            and should be filled by words equivalent <lb/>
            in meaning to, but less prosaic than, <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">τοὺς δ</foreign>’ <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐδὲν</foreign> 8pav. There are three <lb/>
            parties among the Hellenic peoples; <lb/>
            those who are pulling their best; those <lb/>

            who are doing nothing, <foreign xml:lang="grc">δρω̑σ</foreign>’ <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐδὲν</foreign>, supra <lb/>

            Hemsterhuys and Toup pointed out that <lb/>

            No doubt what follows seems more <lb/>

            one of her attendant maidens ; but it is <lb/>
            difficult to believe that Trygaeus ad­ <lb/>

            artificial statue.</p>

            lish editor, Dr. Blaydes, who does so <lb/>
            here. For the words in the text he <lb/>
            reads <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὄζει δὲ καὶ τη̑ς κισίδος</foreign>, leaving <lb/>

            understand <foreign xml:lang="grc">τῃ̑ ὀσμῃ̑</foreign> as if Trygaeus had <lb/>
            used the word <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὀσμὴ</foreign> in the preceding <lb/>

            is read by Richter, Holden, Green, and <lb/>
            Graves, but is certainly wrong. As I <lb/>
            pointed out in the introduction to my <lb/>
            former edition, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὀξυρεγμία</foreign> is used by <lb/>

            Blaydes is the only editor who has <lb/>
            actually altered the text, reading <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὄχλον</foreign>, <lb/>
            but many have suggested an alteration. <lb/>

            feel that I too ought to read <foreign xml:lang="grc">κυάθους</foreign>, <lb/>
            but I cannot bring myself to believe <lb/>
            that <foreign xml:lang="grc">κυάθους προσκείμεναι</foreign> is Greek, or <lb/>
            that it can, as Cobet (N. L. 145) assures <lb/>
            us, be equivalent to <foreign xml:lang="grc">κυάθους προσκειμένους <lb/>
            ἔχουσαι</foreign>. Nor do I perceive the analogy, <lb/>
            upon which he insists, between <foreign xml:lang="grc">κύαθον <lb/>
            προστίθεμαι</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">κύαθον πρόσκειμαι</foreign>, the <lb/>
            latter being an intransitive verb. Nor <lb/>
            am I impressed by his argument that <lb/>
            “ <foreign xml:lang="grc">πρόσκειμαι κυάθω̨</foreign> eo fere sensu dicere­ <lb/>

            for that, I take it, is the very meaning <lb/>
            which the words arc intended to convey. <lb/>
            With Cicero's jest may be compared the <lb/>
            language, which in Beaumont and <lb/>

            a vast number of quotations, but in <lb/>
            every one of them, with the exception <lb/>
            of Medea 1372, the article accompanies <lb/>
            the genitive. A more apposite passage <lb/>
            than any which he has cited may be <lb/>
            found in Pausanias i. 25. 3 <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὰ</foreign> yap <lb/>

            "commenced the trouble"; and we <lb/>
            should certainly expect <foreign xml:lang="grc">τῆς ἄτης</foreign> here. <lb/>
            Bothe in his first edition suggested <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">αὐτὰς ἦρξε</foreign>, but he did not repeat the <lb/>

             <pb n="202"/>
            so unsatisfactory that every effort has <lb/>

            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἤκουσ᾽</foreign> is the conjecture of P1., but if so <lb/>
            it is much the best conjecture of the lot, <lb/>
            and I have in the Commentary given <lb/>
            my reasons for retaining it. Richter <lb/>
            and Zacher say that Aristophanes would <lb/>
            not have combined the expressions <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἄπαξ <lb/>
            τὸ πρῶτον</foreign>, and that may be true with <lb/>
            the reading <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἄκουσ᾽</foreign>; but it is exactly what <lb/>
            he would have done with the reading <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἤκουσ᾽</foreign> for the purpose of expressing <lb/>
            the instantaneous sequence of events.</p>
          <p>616. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἠκηκόειν</foreign> MSS., editions before <lb/>
            Brunck; and Bergk and Mazon after­ <lb/>
            wards. And this is the form which <lb/>
            Aristophanes invariably employed, ex­ <lb/>
            cept where metrical or rhythmical rea­ <lb/>
            sons compelled him to desert it. See the <lb/>
            Fourth Additional Note to the Birds, p. <lb/>
            244 of that Play. Brunch changed the <lb/>
            reading of all the MSS. into <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἠκηκόη</foreign>, <lb/>
            merely saying “<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἠκηκόη</foreign> Attice. Vulgo <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἠκηκόειν</foreign>,” and save as aforesaid he is <lb/>
            followed by all subsequent editors. Mr. <lb/>
            W. M. Starkie, Classical Review ix. 119, <lb/>
            finding that in Wasps 800 Dr. Merry <lb/>
            retains the form <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἠκηκόειν</foreign>, exclaims " Has <lb/>
            the teaching of Cobet and Rutherford <lb/>
            been writ in water ? " To the question, <lb/>
            so worded, the answer must be in the <lb/>
            negative ; for water has some sustaining <lb/>
            power; but if that very competent <lb/>
            scholar, instead of trusting to the <lb/>
            "teaching" of others, had looked into <lb/>
            the matter for himself, he would have <lb/>
            found that this "teaching" has NO­ <lb/>
            THING WHATEVER to support it. Van <lb/>
            Leeuwen indeed may be thought to <lb/>
            have discovered some support for it in <lb/>
            the present passage, for he says that <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἠκηκόη</foreign> is read by " Phrynichus in schol." <lb/>
            But this again is a mistake. The words <lb/>
            of the Scholiast are <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸ δὲ ἠκηκόειν οὖτω <lb/>
            διὰ</foreign> TOV <foreign xml:lang="grc">η Φρύνιχος ἀναγινώσκει</foreign>. The <lb/>
            Scholiast is calling Phrynichus as a wit­ <lb/>
            ness in favour not of <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἠκηκόη</foreign> but of <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἠκη­ <lb/>
            κόειν</foreign>, and the <foreign xml:lang="grc">η</foreign> to which he refers is the <lb/>
            first, not the last, syllable of the word. <lb/>
            He means that the pluperfect is com­ <lb/>
            monly written <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀκηκόειν</foreign> with an a, but <lb/>
            that Phrynichus recognizes the spelling <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἠκηκόειν</foreign> with an <foreign xml:lang="grc">η</foreign>.</p>

            adopted in the Aldine edition and by <lb/>

            By so doing these editors have destroyed <lb/>

            vulgo. The combination of these two <lb/>
            words in one sentence is no doubt a little <lb/>
            awkward, but I do not think that it is <lb/>
            inadmissible. Bothe however proposed <lb/>
            to change <foreign xml:lang="grc">παραδόες</foreign> into <foreign xml:lang="grc">παρελόντες</foreign>. <lb/>
            Hamaker's suggestion <foreign xml:lang="grc">τήνδε σκευὴν ἀπο­ <lb/>

            (N. L. p. 51), but has found favour with <lb/>
            nobody else. Meineke changes <foreign xml:lang="grc">δῶμεν</foreign> <lb/>
            into <foreign xml:lang="grc">φῶμεν</foreign> and is followed by Herwerden. <lb/>
            Blaydes reads <foreign xml:lang="grc">καταθέντες</foreign> for <foreign xml:lang="grc">παραδόντες</foreign>, <lb/>

            Mr. Richards to Blaydes's that it ought <lb/>

            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἒχει</foreign>, so making the line run <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἣν ἒχομεν <lb/>

            with Pl. And this is followed by every <lb/>
            edition before Brunck (except that <lb/>
            Florent Chretien and Grynaeus for <foreign xml:lang="grc">αὐτὸς <lb/>

            <foreign xml:lang="grc">χὠπόσα</foreign>, I did the same in my former <lb/>
            edition, under a complete misunder­ <lb/>
            standing of the reading of R., which had <lb/>
            been reported by Invernizzi, Bekker, <lb/>
            and Dindorf to be <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἣν ἒχομεν ὁδὸν, λόγον</foreign> <lb/>
             <pb n="205"/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">εἲπωμεν</foreign>, the commencement of an ana­ <lb/>
            paestic, not trochaic, line. But, strange <lb/>
            to say, Bekker, while misreporting R.'s <lb/>
            reading, gave in his text what R. really <lb/>
            reads, a trochaic tetrameter <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἣν ἒ</foreign>|<foreign xml:lang="grc">χομεν <lb/>

            And though one of the Scholiasts says that <lb/>
            the <foreign xml:lang="grc">κομμάτιν</foreign> consists of five anapaestic <lb/>
            tetrameters, another says it consists of <lb/>
            four anapaestic tetrameters, and the cor­ <lb/>
            rupt and confused words which follow <lb/>
            can only mean " and one trochaic <lb/>
            tetrameter." Bekker's, which is really <lb/>
            R.'s, reading has been followed by all <lb/>
            subsequent editors, except that Weise <lb/>
            embarks on an unintelligible line of his <lb/>
            own, and that he, Blaydes, Herwerden, <lb/>
            and Merry change <foreign xml:lang="grc">νοῦς</foreign> into <foreign xml:lang="grc">νοῦν</foreign>.</p>

            <foreign xml:lang="grc">Φρυνώνδς</foreign> : vide Hesych. Harpocrat. <lb/>
            Suid." Bentley. This line does not <lb/>
            seem very applicable to Heracles, and <lb/>
            Bergk placed it after the following line, <lb/>
            so as to make it a description of <foreign xml:lang="grc">τοὺς <lb/>
            δαύλους</foreign>, a transposition followed by <lb/>
            several editors. But this necessitates <lb/>
            a further alteration, since <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπίτηδες</foreign> and <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὓνεκα τουδὶ</foreign> would be merely tauto­ <lb/>
            logous. One or the other therefore of <lb/>
            the two lines must be omitted, and <lb/>
            this is accordingly done. On the whole <lb/>
            I think it better to adhere to the ar­ <lb/>
            rangement of the MSS., and to suppose <lb/>
            that the poet is referring to scenes in <lb/>
            Comedies now lost, but familiar to his <lb/>
            audience.</p>

            house, like that of Demosthenes and <lb/>
            Nicias in the Knights.</p>

            <foreign xml:lang="grc">θηρσὶ μεγίστοις</foreign> Merry, Sharpley. This <lb/>
            is a very ingenious alteration, but it <lb/>
            cannot I think be right. Apart from <lb/>
            the overwhelming unanimity of the <lb/>
            MSS., both here and in the Parabasis of <lb/>
            the Wasps, it seems to me that <foreign xml:lang="grc">τοίσι <lb/>
            μεγίστοις</foreign> is exactly what we should have <lb/>
            expected to find. Just as Aristophanes <lb/>
            says in the Ecclesiazusae that Agyrrhius <lb/>
            now <foreign xml:lang="grc">πράττει τὰ μέγιστα</foreign>, undertakes the <lb/>
            most important business, and in the <lb/>
            Birds that <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὰ μέγιστα</foreign>, the most important <lb/>
            benefits that men possess, are derived <lb/>
            from the birds, so here he would natu­ <lb/>
            rally say that the poetic Heracles essays <lb/>
            the most important tasks, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπιχειρεῖ τοῖσι <lb/>
            μεγίστοις</foreign>*. On the other hand, though <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">θηρσὶ</foreign> is in some respects very appro­ <lb/>
            priate, it gives rise to some slight <lb/>
            difficulty. Here there is but one an­ <lb/>
            tagonist; and in the Wasps the Agues <lb/>
            and Fevers, the extirpation of which <lb/>
            constitutes the Second Labour of <lb/>
            Heracles, though rightly called <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὰ <lb/>

            editions before Bekker; and Weise and <lb/>
            Bothe afterwards. But Bentley had <lb/>
            long before suggested <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπεχείρει</foreign>; the <lb/>
            present tense is not employed until the <lb/>
            poet is represented as speaking in his <lb/>
            own person.</p>
          <p>753. <foreign xml:lang="grc">βορβοροθύμους</foreign> MSS. vulgo. <lb/>
            Bentley suggested <foreign xml:lang="grc">βαρβαροθύμους</foreign> and <lb/>
            Meineke writes <foreign xml:lang="grc">βαρβαρομύθυς</foreign>.</p>
          <p>754. Kat <foreign xml:lang="grc">πρῶτον μὲν μάχομαι πάντων</foreign> <lb/>
            MSS. vulgo. Here the poet commences, <lb/>
            as it were, to speak in his own person, <lb/>
            and this is continued to the end of the <lb/>
            Parabasis Proper. He is borrowing <lb/>
            from the Parabasis of the Wasps, and <lb/>
            naturally introduces a few changes to <lb/>
            prevent an absolute sameness. Will it <lb/>
            be believed that, in defiance of all the <lb/>
            MSS., Meineke thinks himself justified <lb/>
            in striking out the new words, intro­ <lb/>
            duced into this line by Aristophanes, <lb/>
            and replacing the discarded words <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">θραϭέως ξυϭτὰς εὐθύς ἀπ</foreign>’ <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀρχῆς</foreign> ? And <lb/>
            this singular impropriety is repeated by <lb/>
            Holden, Herwerden, Van Leeuwen, and <lb/>
            Graves. Van Leeuwen indeed disap­ <lb/>
            proves of the poet's speaking in his own <lb/>
            person, and alters the succeeding verses <lb/>
            in various ways, which it is not necessary <lb/>
            to record, for the purpose of preventing <lb/>
            his doing so. For <foreign xml:lang="grc">μὲν μάχομαι</foreign> Richter <lb/>
            wrote <foreign xml:lang="grc">δὴ</foreign>’<foreign xml:lang="grc">μαχόμην</foreign>.</p>
          <p>756. <foreign xml:lang="grc">κεφαλαὶ</foreign> MSS. vulgo. Meineke <lb/>
            changed this into <foreign xml:lang="grc">γλῶτται</foreign>, and is followed <lb/>
            by Holden, Herwerden, Van Leeuwen, <lb/>
            and Graves. The alteration is sometimes <lb/>
            ascribed to Bentley, but apparently <lb/>
            without any justification. The passage <lb/>
            of Hesiod to which Aristophanes is <lb/>
            referring is <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐκ δέ οἱ ὤμων</foreign> | <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἦν ἑκατὸν <lb/>

            <foreign xml:lang="grc">κάμινον</foreign> would be better. For Pl. with <lb/>
            his usual readiness to alter the text <lb/>
            introduced <foreign xml:lang="grc">καμήλου</foreign> from Wasps 1035. <lb/>
            Aldus, as usual, adopted the reading of <lb/>
            Pl.; and all other editions, with the <lb/>
            exception aforesaid, follow Aldus.</p>

            However a century and a half or so <lb/>

            read by all subsequent editors except <lb/>
            Van Leeuwen. Here too Bentley, sup­ <lb/>
            posing <foreign xml:lang="grc">περινοϭτῶν</foreign> to be Kuster's con­ <lb/>

            unnecessary alteration, but adopted by <lb/>
            Blaydes, Herwerden, and Van Leeuwen. <lb/>
            Richter absurdly understands <foreign xml:lang="grc">τραπέζη</foreign> of <lb/>

            Holden, Richter, and Paley. Bergk <lb/>
            proposed <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἁδρὸν</foreign>, but the reading of the <lb/>

            right, see on 450 supra; but there seems <lb/>

            its voice of spring) editions before <lb/>
            Brunck: a very good reading, if the <lb/>
            metre permitted it. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἠρινὰ</foreign> may either be <lb/>
            governed by <foreign xml:lang="grc">κελαδῇ</foreign>, and agree with <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">κελαδήμαρα</foreign> understood, verna (sc. carmina) <lb/>
            cantat; or else be used adverbially, as <lb/>
            Brunch thinks, verno tempore cantat.</p>
          <p>802. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἑζομένη</foreign> MSS. vulgo. And this is <lb/>
            a characteristic of the swallow's song, <lb/>
            for practically it is only heard when the <lb/>
            bird is perching : see the Commentary. <lb/>
            Its flight is so rapid that even if it is <lb/>
            singing on the wing an observer can <lb/>
            only catch an occasional note. Bergk <lb/>
            however changed <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἑζομένη</foreign> into <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἡδομἐνη</foreign>, <lb/>
            and is followed by Van Leeuwen and <lb/>
            Zacher. The change, though unen­ <lb/>
            durable, is not without excuse, since we <lb/>
            should expect an epithet with <foreign xml:lang="grc">φωνῇ</foreign>, and <lb/>
            we have <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἡδαμένα̣ φωνᾷ</foreign> in Birds 236. But <lb/>
            what are we to say to Meineke's absurd <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἡδομέη</foreign> agreeing with <foreign xml:lang="grc">χελιδών</foreign> ? It is <lb/>
            difficult to speak of it in parliamentary <lb/>
            language. Possibly the use of <foreign xml:lang="grc">φωνῃ</foreign> <lb/>
            without an epithet is due to the fact <lb/>
            that <foreign xml:lang="grc">κελαδεῖν</foreign> may be employed of any <lb/>
            loud noise, and is not confined to vocal <lb/>
            sounds.</p>

            These I think are the only alterations <lb/>
            introduced into the text, but the <lb/>
            conjectures offered for our acceptance <lb/>
            are innumerable. Dr. Blaydes, for ex­ <lb/>
            ample, offers eleven in his critical note; <lb/>
            and, not content with that, adds six more <lb/>
            in his Addenda. As regards the first <lb/>
            syllables of the word Bentley suggested <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">εὐδι</foreign>, and this is adopted by Green. <lb/>
            Bothe too reads <foreign xml:lang="grc">εὐδι</foreign>-, but takes <foreign xml:lang="grc">εὐ</foreign> as <lb/>
            equivalent to <foreign xml:lang="grc">εὐ</foreign>. Van Leeuwen omits the <lb/>
             <pb n="208"/>
            line. The reading -<foreign xml:lang="grc">αυερι</foreign>- (perhaps a <lb/>
            burlesque on -aept-) is very old. The <lb/>
            Scholiast says <foreign xml:lang="grc">Δίδυμος πεπλάνηται λέγων <lb/>
            "αὐεριηχέτους</foreign>” <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐ γὰρ λέγουϭιν αὐέρα <lb/>

            all the MSS. and all editions before <lb/>
            Bergk, and save as hereinafter appears <lb/>
            all subsequent editions. But with Bergk <lb/>
            the assaults of the conjecturers com­ <lb/>
            menced. Bergk continued the words <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">῍Ιων ὁ Χῖος</foreign> to the Servant, and commenced <lb/>
            the speech of Trygaeus with <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὅϭτις ; <lb/>
            ἐποίηϭεν πάλαι</foreign>, which was plainly impos­ <lb/>
            sible, and has been followed by nobody. <lb/>
            Next Meineke tried his hand and con­ <lb/>
            tinued the Servant's speech to <foreign xml:lang="grc">᾽Ααῖόν ποθ᾽</foreign>. <lb/>
            This was adopted by Richter and Holden, <lb/>
            but was really as preposterous as Bergk's. <lb/>
            Herwerden gives to Trygaeus the Ser­ <lb/>
            vant's share of line 834,so that Trygaeus <lb/>
            speaks continuously from <foreign xml:lang="grc">μάλιϭα</foreign> to <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐκάλουν ὀστέρα</foreign>. Wilamowitz, reverting <lb/>
            to Bergk's division of the line, com­ <lb/>
            mences the speech of Trygaeuswith <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὅνπερ <lb/>
            ἐποίηϭεν πάλαι</foreign>, an ingenious suggestion, <lb/>
            which Zacher adopts, but this makes <lb/>
            an involved sentence, unsuited to the <lb/>
            sprightly directness of an Aristophanic <lb/>
            dialogue. The MS. reading, alone, stands <lb/>
            free from all possible objection.</p>

            trum) TOUT-a <foreign xml:lang="grc">ϭύ</foreign> ; TP. <foreign xml:lang="grc">πόθεν ; ἐκ τούρανοῦ</foreign>. <lb/>
            Tyrwhitt altered <foreign xml:lang="grc">ταῦτα</foreign> into <foreign xml:lang="grc">ταύτα</foreign>, and <lb/>
            so Bathe, who in other respects followed <lb/>
            Invernizzi, and this was supposed to <lb/>
            be R.'s actual reading and, except <lb/>
            as herein mentioned, is adopted by <lb/>
            subsequent editors. Hirschig suggested <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ταύτας</foreign> ; TP. <foreign xml:lang="grc">όπόθεν ; ἐκ τοὐρανοῦ</foreign>, which <lb/>
            is read by Meineke, Holden, Blaydes, <lb/>
            Herwerden, Hall and Geldart, Merry, <lb/>
            and Graves.</p>
          <p>851. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἂγε νυν ἲωμεν</foreign>. These words given <lb/>
            to the Servant by all the MSS. and vulgo <lb/>
            are, on the suggestion of Boissonade <lb/>
            (approved by Meineke) transferred to <lb/>
            Trygaeus by Holden, Herwerden, Hall <lb/>
            and Geldart, Merry, Van Leeuwen, <lb/>
            Zacher, and Graves. This is plainly <lb/>
            wrong. Trygaeus was not going any­ <lb/>
            where. He has told the Servant to <lb/>
            take Harvesthome in for her bridal bath, <lb/>
            and then to bring her back again. <lb/>
            Accordingly the Servant now calls upon <lb/>
            the girl to go in with him. It is to her <lb/>
            that these words are addressed. There <lb/>
            is the less excuse for this tampering with <lb/>
            the text, because the passage is carefully <lb/>
            explained by the Scholiast; <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὁ θεράπων</foreign> </p><figure type="illustration">

            without any mention of refreshments, <lb/>

            before this verse, but the other MSS. <lb/>
            continue the verse to Trygaeus, whence <lb/>
            no doubt the reading <foreign xml:lang="grc">φανεὶς</foreign> arose. <lb/>
            Bentley corrected <foreign xml:lang="grc">φανεὶς</foreign> into <foreign xml:lang="grc">φανει̑</foreign> and <lb/>
            restored the line to the Chorus. Then, <lb/>
            in all editions before Dindorf (except <lb/>
            Invernizzi), the following speech of <lb/>
            Trygaeus is arranged as three tetrameter <lb/>
            iambics, the first line ending with <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">κανθάρου βὰς</foreign>, the second with <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐν ται̑ς <lb/>

            <foreign xml:lang="grc">καθεύδειν</foreign> (the readings of Pl.), so that <lb/>
            Trygaeus had, in the whole, a speech <lb/>
            consisting of five consecutive tetra­ <lb/>

            of Trygaeus's speech into two, the <lb/>
            second ending with ’<foreign xml:lang="grc">πιβὰς</foreign>, but this was <lb/>
            not followed. Dindorf was the first to <lb/>

          <p>882. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐς μέσους αὐτός σ</foreign>’. So I wrote the <lb/>
            line in my former edition, and so Graves. <lb/>
            The pronoun <foreign xml:lang="grc">σ</foreign>’ had not previously been <lb/>
            inserted, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ς</foreign> (or <foreign xml:lang="grc">εἰς</foreign>) <foreign xml:lang="grc">μέσους αὐταὺς</foreign> R., all <lb/>
            the other MSS. (except V.), and all <lb/>
            editions before Dindorf. Unfortunately <lb/>
            Bekker gave <foreign xml:lang="grc">αὐτοὺς</foreign> is <foreign xml:lang="grc">μέσους</foreign> (which is <lb/>
            V.'s reading) as the reading of R., and <lb/>
            this being unmetrical Seidler proposed <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">αὐτὰς ἐς μέσους</foreign>, which is read by Dindorf <lb/>
            and all subsequent editors except as <lb/>
            hereinafter mentioned. Green proposed <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">αὐτὰς ἐς μέσον σ</foreign>’, and so Blaydes, Merry, <lb/>
            and Sharpley. Herwerden proposed <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">αὐτὰς ἐς μέσαυς σ</foreign>’, which is read by <lb/>
            Mazon. These alterations depart rather <lb/>
            more widely from the general reading <note type="footnote"> PEACE </note> <note type="footnote"> p </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="210"/>
            of the MSS. than mine, and I am not <lb/>
            sure that <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐς μέσον</foreign> gives the right sense. <lb/>
            Trygaeus speaks of introducing Mayfair <lb/>
            into the senatorial benches; is <foreign xml:lang="grc">μέσον</foreign> <lb/>
            might mean that he was about to <lb/>
            exhibit her in the centre of the stage.</p>
          <p>886. <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὰ σκεύη</foreign> R.V. vulgo. <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὴν σκευὴν</foreign> <lb/>
            Meineke, Herwerden, Merry. For, says <lb/>
            Meineke, “sequentia ostendunt aperte <lb/>
            jubere Trygaeum Theoriam ut nudam <lb/>
            sese spectandam praebeat." The <lb/>
            learned professor does not seem to be <lb/>
            aware that, just as actors who repre­ <lb/>
            sented men wore the penem scorteum <lb/>
            outside their clothes, so actors who <lb/>
            represented women exhibited the signs <lb/>
            of womanhood outside (or on) their <lb/>
            clothes, though even the dozen preceding <lb/>
            lines might have taught him that. And <lb/>
            he must have forgotten that if Mayfair <lb/>
            " nudam sese spectandam praebuisset" <lb/>
            she would have shown that she was not <lb/>
            a woman but a man.</p>
          <p>890. <foreign xml:lang="grc">μετέωρα</foreign> MSS. vulgo. Blaydes <lb/>
            suggested <foreign xml:lang="grc">μετεώρω</foreign>, which is read by <lb/>
            Herwerden, Sharpley, Van Leeuwen, and <lb/>
            Zacher.—<foreign xml:lang="grc">καταγαγει̑ν</foreign> MSS. vulgo. Blay­ <lb/>
            des conjectured <foreign xml:lang="grc">κᾆτ ἀγαγει̑ν</foreign>, which <lb/>
            Herwerden and Van Leeuwen read. <lb/>
            But I doubt if <foreign xml:lang="grc">κᾆτα</foreign>can be used, like <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">εἶτα</foreign>, to combine a participle with a <lb/>
            verb.</p>
          <p>891. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὁρα̑τε τοὐπτάνιαν ἡμι̑ν καλόν</foreign>. This <lb/>
            is the reading of Pl. Brunch, Invernizzi, <lb/>
            and Weise, except that for <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἡμι̑ν</foreign> they <lb/>
            read <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὑμι̑ν. ὁρα̑τε τοὐπτάνιον</foreign> is the reading <lb/>
            of all the MSS., but in R. it is <lb/>
            followed by <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἡμι̑ν ὡς καλὸν</foreign>, in V. by <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὡς <lb/>
            καλὸν ἡμι̑ν</foreign>, and in the other MSS. (except <lb/>
            P1.) by <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὑμι̑ν ὡς καλόν</foreign>, all three readings <lb/>
            being unmetrical. Save as aforesaid all <lb/>
            editors retain the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὡς</foreign>, most of them <lb/>
            reading with Bentley <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὁρα̂τ</foreign>’ <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὀπτάνιον</foreign>, and <lb/>
            others with Bekker opa <foreign xml:lang="grc">τοὐπτάνιον</foreign>, some <lb/>
            in each case adding <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἡμι̑ν</foreign> and others <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὑμι̑ν</foreign>. I am unwilling to give up the <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὡς</foreign>, but more unwilling to give up the <lb/>
            article <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸ ὸπτάνιον</foreign> which every MS. <lb/>
            reads. And therefore I follow on this <lb/>
            point the reading of P1.</p>
          <p>892. <foreign xml:lang="grc">κεκάπνικέ</foreign> rap'. So I read in the <lb/>
            former edition, the various readings of <lb/>
            the MSS. <foreign xml:lang="grc">κεκάπνικ</foreign>’<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἄρα</foreign>, or ap', or <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἆρ</foreign>’ <lb/>
            being all unmetrical. One or other of <lb/>
            them was followed by all the earlier <lb/>
            editions. Brunch read <foreign xml:lang="grc">κεκάπνικεν ἆρ</foreign>’, <lb/>
            which is followed by Invernizzi, Bergk, <lb/>
            Mazon, and Zacher. Dindorf read <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">κεκάπνικεν ἄρ</foreign>’, changing the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ένταυ̑θα</foreign> yap <lb/>
            which follows in the MSS. into <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐντευ̑θεν</foreign> <lb/>
            yap <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἦν</foreign>, and omitting the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἦν</foreign> at the end <lb/>
            of the next verse, and others have done <lb/>
            much the same. Blaydes inserts rot <lb/>
            before <foreign xml:lang="grc">καὶ κεκάπνικ</foreign>’, and so Herwerden. <lb/>
            Several editors give this and the next <lb/>
            line to the Servant.</p>
          <p>897. <foreign xml:lang="grc">πλαγίαν καταβάλλειν κ.τ.λ</foreign>. This <lb/>
            line was introduced by Invernizzi from <lb/>
            R. and is adopted by all subsequent <lb/>
            editors except Bothe. It does not ap­ <lb/>
            pear in any other MS., and it is difficult <lb/>
            to see how it applies to the festival. I <lb/>
            expect that Aristophanes, observing <lb/>
            this, superseded it by the line <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπὶ γη̑ς <lb/>
            παλαίειν κ.τ.λ</foreign>.</p>
          <p>906. <foreign xml:lang="grc">θέασ</foreign>’ R. V. and all MSS. (except <lb/>
            Pl.) Invernizzi, recentiores, except Weise <lb/>
            and Merry, and except that Dindorf <lb/>
            introduced the spelling <foreign xml:lang="grc">θα̑σ</foreign>’ which has <lb/>
            been adopted by several editors, quite <lb/>
            unnecessarily; see on 48 supra. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἴθ</foreign>’ Pl. <lb/>

            Zacher, and Graves. <foreign xml:lang="grc">πολίτης</foreign> MSS. vulgo. <lb/>
            Hermann's emendation seems to me <lb/>
            indubitably right. Such a sentence as <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">χρηστὸς ἀνὴρ πολίτης ἐστὶν ἅπασιν</foreign> would <lb/>
            be singularly top-heavy; and though <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἅποσιν</foreign> does not necessarily require a <lb/>
            substantive, it would in all probability <lb/>
            have one here as it has four lines below.</p>

            other MSS. except Pl. who (I presume <lb/>
            from an erroneous notion that the metre <lb/>
            required it) inserted <foreign xml:lang="grc">γ̕</foreign>between <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὅστις</foreign> <lb/>
            and <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐστὶ</foreign>, and so vulgo.</p>

            where the assent takes this shape; infra <lb/>

            Brunck, recentiores, except Van Leeu­ <lb/>
            wen. Pl. after <foreign xml:lang="grc">φήσεις</foreign> inserted <foreign xml:lang="grc">τί δη̑τ̕̕̕̕</foreign>’ (no <lb/>
            doubt from its double appearance in the <lb/>
            strophe 859 and 863) and omitted <foreign xml:lang="grc">νέου</foreign>, <lb/>
            and so all editions, except Fracini, be­ <lb/>
            fore Gelenius. Rapheleng omitted both <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">τί δη̑τ</foreign>’ and <foreign xml:lang="grc">νέου</foreign>, so making the line a foot <lb/>
            too short, and Kuster and Bergler in­ <lb/>
            serted them both, so making it a foot too <lb/>
            long. Tyrwhitt proposed to substitute <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">τί δη̑τ̕̕</foreign>’ for <foreign xml:lang="grc">φήοεις</foreign>, and this is done by <lb/>
            Van Leeuwen.</p>
          <p>918. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἄξιος</foreign> MSS. vulgo. Dawes (at Ach. <lb/>
            633) changed this to <foreign xml:lang="grc">αἴτιος</foreign>, which is <lb/>
            quite inadmissible. But he atoned for <lb/>
            this error by adding the article to <foreign xml:lang="grc">Ἀθ­ <lb/>
            μονεὺς</foreign>, in which he is followed by Brunck <lb/>
            and all subsequent editors. The first <lb/>
            syllable of<foreign xml:lang="grc">Ἀθμονεὺς</foreign> is short in 190 supra. <lb/>
            The name <foreign xml:lang="grc">Τρυγαι̑ος</foreign> is omitted in Pl. and <lb/>
            in all editions before Brunck, but was <lb/>
            restored by Bentley, was found by <lb/>
            Brunck in P2., has since been discovered <lb/>
            in R. V. and the other MSS., and is read <lb/>
            by Brunck and all subsequent editors.</p>
          <p>921. <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸν δημότην</foreign>. After this word the <lb/>
            MSS. and all editions before Dindorf <lb/>
            insert <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὅμιλον</foreign>, which is shown by the <lb/>
            corresponding verse in the strophe to be <lb/>
            an interpolation. It is therefore omitted <lb/>

            The <foreign xml:lang="grc">θεο</foreign>- is pronounced as a mono­ <lb/>

            And the other MSS. agree with P1., save <lb/>
            only that they omit the <foreign xml:lang="grc">γ</foreign>’ and give <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸ <lb/>

            tulates the insertion of <foreign xml:lang="grc">γ</foreign>’. Bergler <lb/>
            proposed <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἵν</foreign>’ <foreign xml:lang="grc">εἰ ἐν</foreign> " si <foreign xml:lang="grc">εἰ</foreign> corripiendum est <lb/>

            The latter suggestion was again ad­ <lb/>
            vanced by Elmsley who proposed (at <lb/>
            Ach. 335) to read <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸ ῤῆμ</foreign>’ <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπίτηδες οὖν</foreign> <lb/>
            with <foreign xml:lang="grc">λέγων</foreign> in the following line as a <lb/>
            nominative absolute. This seems very <lb/>
            improbable, but is adopted by Dindorf <lb/>
            and Paley. Bentley proposed to sub­ <lb/>
            stitute <foreign xml:lang="grc">εὶ</foreign> for <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐν</foreign>, and so Brunck. Por­ <lb/>
            son, also reading TO <foreign xml:lang="grc">ῥῆμ</foreign>’, proposed to <lb/>
            insert <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐὰν</foreign> between <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἵν</foreign>’ and <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐν</foreign>, and this is <lb/>

            Meineke inserted <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὅταν</foreign> in the same place, <lb/>
            and so Holden, Green, Blaydes, recen­ <lb/>

            The reading of R. and all the MSS. <lb/>

            Aldus, Junta, and Junta II. The line <lb/>
            is omitted in Fracini, but the Scholiast <lb/>
            has <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπείγετε</foreign>. Some editors have thought <lb/>
            that, as the three following lines are <lb/>
            anapaestic, this should be the same. It <lb/>
            is said (in Bekker's edition) that Dindorf <lb/>
            adopted <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἄγ</foreign>’ <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπείγετε</foreign> at Hermann's sug­ <lb/>
            gestion. This must have been in some <lb/>
            early edition. Dindorf ignores it alto­ <lb/>
            gether in his Oxford edition, and in his <lb/>
            treatise De Metris. It is however read <lb/>
            by Richter, Holden, Sharpley, and <lb/>
            Graves. “Hotibius ” suggested <foreign xml:lang="grc">κατεπεί­ <lb/>
            γετε</foreign> which is read by Mazon. It is <lb/>
            however to be observed that the first <lb/>
            line in each speech of the Chorus in <lb/>
            this and in the corresponding system is <lb/>
            metrically different from its successor: <lb/>
            and the simple <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπείγετε</foreign> seems more for­ <lb/>

            line, as it stands, must be taken as an <lb/>
            iambic dipody, followed by a cretic. <lb/>
            In order to make it an iambic Bentley <lb/>
            proposed o <foreign xml:lang="grc">Χαῖρις ἢν ὑμᾶς</foreign>, and Brunck, <lb/>
            borrowing the final word of the preced­ <lb/>
            ing line, reads <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὡς Χαῖρις ἢν ὑμᾶς</foreign>; while <lb/>
            in order to make it a glyconic Bergk <lb/>
            reads <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἢν Χαῖρις ὀλὰς</foreign>. In the antistrophe <lb/>
            we have <foreign xml:lang="grc">εν ἄνδρα τοιοῦτον</foreign>, and though <lb/>
            the first syllable of <foreign xml:lang="grc">τοιοῦτος</foreign> is often <lb/>
            long, as in Knights 49, Wasps 384, Birds <lb/>
            136, &amp;c., it is more commonly short. <lb/>
            The line is probably glyconic, but <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὀλὰς</foreign> <lb/>
            seems grotesque. Something like <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἢν <lb/>

            proposed to read <foreign xml:lang="grc">δαλίον</foreign> here, as indeed <lb/>
            Bentley had previously suggested. And <lb/>
            this is done by Bothe, Dindorf, and all <lb/>

            expected this passage to escape the <lb/>

            Blaydes offers five alternatives, one of <lb/>

            R. nor V. has the sign of a new speaker <lb/>
            before this line, so that, with them, it is <lb/>
            a continuation of the preceding speech. <lb/>
            Accordingly in Fracini and in all <lb/>
            editions prior to that called Scaliger's, <lb/>
            and in Kuster and Bergler afterwards, <lb/>
            it is continued to the Servant. In <lb/>
            “ Scaliger's " and " Faber's " it is given <lb/>
            to Trygaeus, to whom it was restored <lb/>
            by Brunck and by all subsequent editors <lb/>
            before Bergk ; and by Green and Paley <lb/>
            afterwards. But Bentley and Tyrwhitt <lb/>
            suggested that the last two words belong <lb/>
            to a second speaker, and V. is found to <lb/>
            preface them (though R. does not) with <lb/>
            the sign of a new speaker. And the <foreign xml:lang="grc">δὴ</foreign> <lb/>
            is certainly apt fora speaker not making, <lb/>
            but assenting to, a proposal. And so, <lb/>
            though the first four words have been <lb/>
            left to Trygaeus, the last two have been <lb/>
            assigned to the Chorus by Bergk, <lb/>
            Meineke, Holden, Hall and Geldart, <lb/>
            Sharpley, Van Leeuwen, and Graves; <lb/>
            and to the Servant by Richter, Blaydes, <lb/>
            Herwerden, Merry, Mazon, and Zacher. <lb/>
            My reasons for leaving the entire line to <lb/>
            Trygaeus will be found in the Com­ <lb/>
            mentary.</p>
          <p>990. <foreign xml:lang="grc">τρία καὶ δέκ</foreign>’ <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἔτη</foreign> R. V. vulgo. <lb/>
            This is quite accurate : see the Com­ <lb/>
            mentary and the Introduction to this <lb/>
            Play. Many critics however unaccount­ <lb/>
            ably assumed that the period of 13 years <lb/>
            here mentioned is intended to commence <lb/>
            with the commencement of the Archi­ <lb/>
            damian War. Paulmier, Brunck, and <lb/>
            others, therefore, thought it clear that <lb/>
            the Comedy was not exhibited nntil the <lb/>
            year 418 B. c. This notion, sufficiently <lb/>
            refuted (one would think) by the <lb/>
            Comedy itself, was finally disposed of by <lb/>
             <pb n="214"/>
            the discovery of the didascalia, first <lb/>
            printed in Bekker's edition, which <lb/>
            showed that it was exhibited in 421. <lb/>
            Since then, on the same erroneous <lb/>
            assumption, attempts have been made <lb/>
            to alter the text. Blaydes proposed <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">δέκτον τοδ</foreign>’ <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἔτος</foreign>, Herwerden <foreign xml:lang="grc">σου δίχα <lb/>

            somewhere seen, though I cannot <lb/>
            recall where, the suggestion <foreign xml:lang="grc">τρικακῶς <lb/>
            δέκ</foreign>’ <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἔτη</foreign>. But these are merely academic <lb/>
            conjectures ; nobody has really altered <lb/>
            the text.</p>
          <p>1000. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐμπλησθῆναι μ</foreign>є<foreign xml:lang="grc">γάλων</foreign> R. V. vulgo. <lb/>
            I observed in my former edition that in <lb/>
            all probability Aristophanes is in this <lb/>
            first group of articles (999-1002) refer­ <lb/>
            ring exclusively to the products of Megara <lb/>
            and the Peloponnese. Hamaker proposed <lb/>
            to change <foreign xml:lang="grc">μ</foreign>є<foreign xml:lang="grc">γάλων</foreign> into 'K Mє<foreign xml:lang="grc">γάρων</foreign>, and <lb/>
            this is done by Meineke, Blaydes, <lb/>
            Herwerden, Mazon, Van Leeuwen, <lb/>
            Zacher, and Graves ; while Mr. Sharpley, <lb/>
            leaving the present line as it stands, <lb/>
            substitutes <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐκ μὲν</foreign> Mє<foreign xml:lang="grc">γάρων</foreign> in the pre­ <lb/>
            ceding line for <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἡμ</foreign>ȋ<foreign xml:lang="grc">ν ἀγαθῶν</foreign>. These <lb/>
            changes give far too much importance <lb/>
            to the resources of Megara. To repre­ <lb/>
            sent the Athenians as exulting in the <lb/>
            idea that their market would be full of <lb/>
            good things imported from Megara is <lb/>
            contrary to all the facts of history. The <lb/>
            exclusion of Megara from the Athenian <lb/>
            markets was the voluntary act of the <lb/>
            Athenians themselves, and while it <lb/>
            ruined Megara did not affect the <lb/>
            Athenians at all. That unfortunate <lb/>
            country, now a mere desert owing to <lb/>
            the incursions of the Athenian armies, <lb/>
            was in its most flourishing days of little <lb/>
            importance to the Athenian market. <lb/>
            The soil was poor (<foreign xml:lang="grc">παράλυπρος</foreign>, Strabo ix. <lb/>
            1, § 8, p. 393), and there was never any­ <lb/>
            thing to import except such trifles as <lb/>
            garlic, cucumbers, and the like. In the <lb/>
            Acbarnians, the Boeotian brings a load <lb/>
            of good things such as those enumerated <lb/>
            below 1003-5. The Megarian has <lb/>
            nothing whatever to bring. It seems to <lb/>
            me therefore preposterous to confine <lb/>
            this first group of articles to Megara. <lb/>
            The apples and pomegranates would <lb/>
            come from other districts of the <lb/>
            Peloponnese.</p>
          <p>1012. є<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἶτα μονῳδε</foreign>ȋ<foreign xml:lang="grc">ν</foreign>. Here the lacuna <lb/>

            and in all editions before Bekker, and <lb/>
            by Bothe afterwards. Florent Chretien <lb/>
            changed it to <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὰς</foreign> and so Bekker, and, <lb/>
            save as aforesaid, all subsequent editors. <lb/>
            The change seems a necessary conse­ <lb/>
            quence of the reading <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀποχηρωθείς</foreign>.</p>

            vulgo. <foreign xml:lang="grc">μένοντα νῦν</foreign> Brunck, Invernizzi, <lb/>
            Bothe. But the corresponding line in <lb/>
            the strophe (939) is iambo-trochaic, and <lb/>
            the efforts of all later editors have <lb/>
            been directed to making this an iambo- <lb/>
            trochaic line also. Dindorf in his text <lb/>
            marked a lacuna before <foreign xml:lang="grc">μένοντα</foreign>, and <lb/>
            this is followed by Holden, Bergk, <lb/>
            Meineke, Green, Hall and Geldart, and <lb/>
            Merry. That lacuna was filled by <lb/>
            Richter with <foreign xml:lang="grc">μένειν</foreign> Kat, by Enger and <lb/>
            Van Leeuwen with <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐνθαδὶ</foreign> after <foreign xml:lang="grc">θύρασιν</foreign>, <lb/>
            while Blaydes suggested <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὦ γέρον</foreign> in <lb/>
            the same place with <foreign xml:lang="grc">πῦρ καὶ</foreign> for <foreign xml:lang="grc">τοίνυν</foreign> <lb/>
             <pb n="215"/>
            But Dindorf in his notes said that he <lb/>
            now thought it more probable that the <lb/>
            lacuna came after <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐνοντα</foreign> (or <foreign xml:lang="grc">μένοντ</foreign>') <lb/>
            and that <foreign xml:lang="grc">τοίνυν</foreign> should be struck out; <lb/>
            and so Weise, Blaydes, Herwerden. <lb/>
            Blaydes suggested in his notes (besides <lb/>
            the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὦ γέρον</foreign> mentioned above) two modes <lb/>
            of filling up this lacuna, <foreign xml:lang="grc">μένοντ' ἐνθάδ</foreign>’ <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὦ Τρυγαῖε</foreign>, or <foreign xml:lang="grc">μένοντ</foreign>’ <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὦ Τρυγαῖε καὶ πῦρ</foreign>. <lb/>
            I had written the line as in my text <lb/>
            before I observed that he had, in his <lb/>
            Addenda, offered a fourth suggestion, <lb/>
            very similar to mine, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐνθάδε ξὺν ἡμῖν</foreign>, <lb/>
            though of course <foreign xml:lang="grc">ξὺν ἡμῖν</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">μεθ</foreign>’ <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἡμῶν</foreign> <lb/>
            had very different meanings,</p>
          <p>1028-9. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐστιν τόν γε σοφῇ</foreign>. There have <lb/>
            been so many small variations in these <lb/>
            lines that it is not worth while to record <lb/>
            them. All the MSS. except P1. have <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐστι τὸν σοφῇ</foreign>, and so Bekker, Bergk, <lb/>
            Meineke, and Graves. P1. and all <lb/>
            editions before Brunck have <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐστὶ χρεὼν</foreign> <lb/>
            TOP <foreign xml:lang="grc">γε σοφῇ</foreign>. Dindorf omits <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐστι</foreign> and <lb/>
            marks a lacuna between <foreign xml:lang="grc">σοφῇ</foreign> and <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">δόκιμον</foreign>, and many have done the same. <lb/>
            But Hermann changed <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐστι</foreign> into <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐστιν</foreign>, <lb/>
            and this with PIs <foreign xml:lang="grc">τόν</foreign> ye gives the re­ <lb/>
            quired metre. And the line as written <lb/>
            in my text is read by Hall and Geldart, <lb/>

            σεσθε</foreign>, though indeed the same change <lb/>
            had been suggested by Bentley before <lb/>
            Dawes had enunciated his rule. On the <lb/>
            other hand Elmsley, in an excellent note <lb/>
            on Oed. Col. 177, lays down " <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐ μὴ</foreign> cum <lb/>
            future vetantis est, cum subjunctive vero <lb/>
            negantis," and would alter here <foreign xml:lang="grc">παύσει</foreign> <lb/>
            into <foreign xml:lang="grc">παύσῃ</foreign>, and infra 1226 <foreign xml:lang="grc">ποιήσει</foreign> into <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ποιήσῃ</foreign>. And this alteration is made in <lb/>
            both passages by Blaydes, Sharpley, and <lb/>
            Van Leeuwen, and in this passage by <lb/>
            Hall and Geldart, and Graves. I cannot <lb/>
            follow them in this, or in striking out <lb/>
            the <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐ</foreign> in the <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐ μή σ</foreign>’ <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐγὼ περιόψομαι</foreign> of <lb/>
            Frogs 508. I do not believe that the <lb/>
            rule was so strict as Dawes on the one <lb/>
            hand, or Elmsley on the other, contends: <lb/>
            or that <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐ μὴ</foreign> might not be used as an em­ <lb/>
            phatic negative either with the future in­ <lb/>

            I leave <foreign xml:lang="grc">παύσησθε</foreign> in Lys. 704 because all <lb/>
            the MSS. read it, and for the same reason <lb/>

            general reading. But Bekker and <lb/>

            there, which can hardly be right; while <lb/>
            Bergk introduced <foreign xml:lang="grc">τρηχὺν</foreign> into both <lb/>

            other MSS. and vulgo. Recent editors <lb/>
            have fallen away to <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀπένεγκε</foreign> because it <lb/>
            is alleged by Richter and Blaydes that <lb/>
            Aristophanes invariably uses <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἔνεγκε</foreign> the <lb/>
            second aorist form, and never <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἔνεγκον</foreign> the <lb/>
            first aorist form, of the imperative. <lb/>
            Yet we have <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐνεγκάτω</foreign> infra 1149 and in <lb/>
            Ach. 805, Wasps 529, Frogs 1304, and <lb/>

            860. And besides, this is the only place <lb/>
            in which the second person singular is <lb/>
            found at the end of the line, and that too <lb/>
            an heroic hexameter which seldom closes <lb/>
            with a short vowel. In all the fifty­ <lb/>

            many other conjectures, suggested <foreign xml:lang="grc">τί δαὶ <lb/>
            ᾽γώ</foreign>; which Zacher adopts. The MS. <lb/>
            readings <foreign xml:lang="grc">τί δὴ ᾽γώ</foreign>; and <foreign xml:lang="grc">τί δ᾽ ἔγωγε</foreign>; seem <lb/>
            better than any of these conjectures.</p>

            centiores, except Weise and Bothe. <lb/>
            The other MSS. and all editions before <lb/>
            Brunck omit <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὦ</foreign>, so making the line <lb/>
            a syllable short. Bentley therefore <lb/>
            suggested beginning the line with either <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὦ</foreign> (which is found to be the true reading) <lb/>
            or <foreign xml:lang="grc">παῖ</foreign>. Dawes also suggested 'rat, and <lb/>
            this is read by Brunck and Weise, and <lb/>
            by Bothe in his second edition, though <lb/>
            in his first he had read <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὦ</foreign>. Dawes in­ <lb/>
            tended <foreign xml:lang="grc">παῖ</foreign> for the vocative of <foreign xml:lang="grc">παῖς</foreign>, but <lb/>
            Brunck must have taken it as an ab­ <lb/>
            breviated form of <foreign xml:lang="grc">παῖε</foreign>, since in his <lb/>
            translation he altered Bergler's double <lb/>
            percite, percute into a triple percute, <lb/>
            percute, percute. And this is approved <lb/>
            by Elmsley (in a note at the end of his <lb/>
            Review of Hermann's "Hercules Fu­ <lb/>
            rens," Classical Journal viii. 218) who <lb/>

            from R., by Invernizzi, who is followed <lb/>
            by all subsequent editors. Apparently <lb/>
            it is found in all the MSS. except P1., but <lb/>
            it is absent from every edition before <lb/>

            mann, with his usual want of judgement, <lb/>
            kept it out of Bergler's text. Brunck <lb/>
            read <foreign xml:lang="grc">συγκέας</foreign>, but before any other edition <lb/>
            was published Bergler's conjecture was <lb/>

            all the conjectures, and as it has since <lb/>
            been approved by Blaydes, and adopted <lb/>
            by Herwerden (who however, I suppose <lb/>
            by a clerical error, spells it <foreign xml:lang="grc">έκπεπρημνισ­ <lb/>

            this is contra metrum. Pl. has <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">έκπεπιεσμένα</foreign>, and so all editions before <lb/>

            Mazon, Sharpley, Van Leeuwen, and <lb/>
            Zacher, and this is no doubt nearer the <lb/>
            MS. reading, but I think that the <lb/>
            genitive is necessary, not indeed for the <lb/>
             <pb n="218"/>
            metre but for the sense. The order is <lb/>

            the system admits no paeon except in <lb/>

            without the slightest objection having <lb/>
            been taken to the genuine, and far <lb/>
            superior, reading. Cf. <foreign xml:lang="grc">εὖποιου̑ντος</foreign> <lb/>
            infra 1157.</p>
          <p>1146. 'K <foreign xml:lang="grc">του̑ χωρίον</foreign>. The 'K was sug­ <lb/>
            gested by Bentley, and being found in <lb/>
            both R. and V. is read by Invernizzi and <lb/>
            all subsequent editors except Weise. It is <lb/>
            omitted in the other MSS. and editions.</p>
          <p>1154. <foreign xml:lang="grc">Αἀσχινάδου</foreign> MSS. vulgo. This is <lb/>
            the third instance of a name being <lb/>
            introduced into these Comedies which <lb/>
            does not seem to be in accordance with <lb/>
            the metre, the others being Lacratides <lb/>
            (Ach. 220) and Hippodamus (Knights <lb/>
            327), where see the notes. They are all <lb/>
            proper names, and it may be that to <lb/>
            appellations so constantly in use custom <lb/>
            gave an accent which did not properly <lb/>
            belong to them, and consequently that <lb/>
            though the second syllable of <foreign xml:lang="grc">Αίσχίνης</foreign> is <lb/>
            short, that of <foreign xml:lang="grc">Αἱσχινάδου</foreign> may be long. <lb/>
            Here several attempts have been made <lb/>
            to amend the metre. Elmsley (at Ach. <lb/>
            220) proposed to insert <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὖν</foreign>after <foreign xml:lang="grc">αἳτησον</foreign>. <lb/>
            Meinekc in the Fragm. Corn. Graec. iv. <lb/>
            542 (on the Philargyrus of Dioxippus) <lb/>
            suggested <foreign xml:lang="grc">Αίσχυνάδου</foreign> which is read by <lb/>
            Green and Blaydes, but in his own <lb/>
            edition he gave '<foreign xml:lang="grc">Αρχινάδου</foreign>. Herwerden <lb/>
            proposed <foreign xml:lang="grc">Αἱσχρωνίδου</foreign>. But the most <lb/>
            ingenious of all these conjectures is <lb/>
            that of Van Leeuwen who reads <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἒξ πορ' <lb/>
            Αἱσ χίνου</foreign>, six myrtles from Aeschines. <lb/>
            With this lengthening of a short vowel <lb/>
            in a proper name scholars compare Aesch. <lb/>
            Septem 483, 542 '<foreign xml:lang="grc">Ιππομέδοντος</foreign> and <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">Παρθενοπαϊος</foreign>, where the second syllable <lb/>
            in each name is treated as if it were long.</p>

            R. I. P2- Markland (at Eur. Suppl. 1181) <lb/>
            conjectured <foreign xml:lang="grc">Χεζικηνικὸν</foreign>, which is adopted <lb/>
            by Brunck, Invernizzi, and Bekker. <lb/>
            Brunck also changed <foreign xml:lang="grc">αὐτὸς</foreign> to <foreign xml:lang="grc">αὑσὴ</foreign>, viz. <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὴ φοινικὶς</foreign>, which perhaps was necessary <lb/>
            with <foreign xml:lang="grc">Χεζικηνικὸν</foreign>, but which really de­ <lb/>
             <pb n="219"/>
            stroys the contrast intended between the <lb/>
            man's face and his cloke, as in Lys. 1140, <lb/>
            where Pericleidas is described as <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὠχρὰς <lb/>
            ὲν φαινικίδι</foreign>. Lines 1175,1176 are omitted <lb/>
            in the text of V., but are added in the <lb/>
            margin.</p>
          <p>1178. <foreign xml:lang="grc">λινοπτώμενος</foreign> MSS. vulgo. This <lb/>
            is the reading of every MS. and every <lb/>
            edition, but it has been assailed of late <lb/>
            years on the ground that the first <lb/>
            syllable of <foreign xml:lang="grc">λίνον</foreign> is short. That is of <lb/>
            course true, and is probably the very <lb/>
            reason why the word is employed here. <lb/>
            I said in ray former edition that the <lb/>
            sentence appeared to be a parody of <lb/>
            some passage unknown ; and the parody <lb/>
            may be due to the fact that the parodied <lb/>
            poet had made the first syllable long. <lb/>
            The substitutions proposed have been <lb/>
            singularly infelicitous, such as <foreign xml:lang="grc">ληνοπτώ­ <lb/>

            done by Richter, Holden, and several <lb/>
            recent editors. It is of course the par­ <lb/>
            ticiple of <foreign xml:lang="grc">προσίστημι</foreign>, but the Attics do <lb/>
            not seem to have doubled the <foreign xml:lang="grc">σ</foreign> in these <lb/>
            compounds of <foreign xml:lang="grc">πράς</foreign>. Neither <foreign xml:lang="grc">προσστὰς</foreign> <lb/>

            the transcriber forgot to alter.</p>
          <p>1190. <foreign xml:lang="grc">έν μάχη</foreign> MSS. vulgo. Zacher <lb/>
            strangely represents Dobree as propos­ <lb/>
            ing to change this into <foreign xml:lang="grc">έν 'Εφέσῳ</foreign>. But <lb/>
            Dobree is correcting not Aristophanes, <lb/>
            but the Scholiast. The Scholium runs <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">Παροιμία παρὰ τοὺς έν τη̑̑ 'Ασίᾳ Λάκωνας <lb/>
            ὰτυχήσαντας, " οἲκοι λέοντες, ἐν 'Εφέσῳ δὲ <lb/>
            Λάκωνες</foreign>." And when Dobree says <lb/>
            " Schol. Lege <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὲν 'Εφέσῳ δ' άλώπεκες</foreign>, ut <lb/>
            Kuhn. ad Aelian. V. H. xiii. 9" he means, <lb/>
            as Kuhn had said before him, that the <lb/>
            proverb should run <foreign xml:lang="grc">οἲκοι λέοντες, ἐν 'Εφέ­ <lb/>

            He is proposing to change <foreign xml:lang="grc">Λάκωνες</foreign> to <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">άλώπεκες</foreign> in the Scholium not <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐν μάχη</foreign> to <lb/>

          <p>1201. <foreign xml:lang="grc">πεντήκαντά δρᾱχμω̑ν</foreign> MSS. vulgo. <lb/>
            The first syllable of <foreign xml:lang="grc">δραχμὴ</foreign> is long here, <lb/>
            as in Wasps 691, Plutus 1020, several <lb/>
            fragments of other Comic Poets, and <lb/>
            probably in other lines of Aristophanes, <lb/>
             <pb n="220"/>
            such as Ach. 161 and the line following <lb/>
            the present, in each of which an ana­ <lb/>
            paest is more rhythmical than a tribrach. <lb/>
            It is however more commonly short; <lb/>
            and Dawes (at Plutus 166) proposes to <lb/>
            insert <foreign xml:lang="grc">γἐὠ</foreign> after <foreign xml:lang="grc">δρᾰχμω̑ν</foreign> in the present <lb/>
            line. But Dawes was arguing that a <lb/>
            short vowel could not be made long <lb/>
            before <foreign xml:lang="grc">χμ</foreign> ; he was not considering the <lb/>
            case of a vowel which in its own nature <lb/>
            might be either long or short, quite <lb/>
            apart from the consonants which might <lb/>
            happen to follow it. Plautus (Trinum­ <lb/>
            mus ii.. 4. 23) divides the consonants <foreign xml:lang="grc">χ</foreign> <lb/>
            and <foreign xml:lang="grc">μ</foreign>, writing drachumarum, but still <lb/>
            makes the first syllable long. Brunck <lb/>
            inserted <foreign xml:lang="grc">αὓτ</foreign>' " id est <foreign xml:lang="grc">τἀ δρέπανα</foreign> " after <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">δραχμω̑ν</foreign>, and is followed by Invernizzi. <lb/>
            Elmsley, at Ach. 178, found a further <lb/>
            fault with the line, viz. "plane absurdum <lb/>
            esse falces quinquagenis drachmis ae­ <lb/>
            stimari, cum proximo versu cadi trims <lb/>
            veneant." And this objection is echoed <lb/>
            by several subsequent editors. Very <lb/>
            likely they are right. But I am not <lb/>
            myself aware of the relative values of a <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">δρέπανον</foreign> and a <foreign xml:lang="grc">κάδας</foreign>; and am certainly <lb/>
            not prepared to say that a <foreign xml:lang="grc">δρέπαναν</foreign>, <lb/>
            which was a much more elaborate im­ <lb/>
            plement than our sickle, might not have <lb/>
            been worth as much as 16 or 17 little <lb/>
            casks for country use or nearly as much <lb/>
            as a trumpet, infra 1241. However, <lb/>
            Elmsley proposed to read <foreign xml:lang="grc">νυνὶ</foreign>8' <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὲγὼ <lb/>

            (save that he changes <foreign xml:lang="grc">ταυ̑τ</foreign>' into <foreign xml:lang="grc">πάντ</foreign>', <lb/>
            surely a change for the worse) by Van <lb/>

            Florent Chretien's proposal, to read <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">κάδων θ</foreign>' for <foreign xml:lang="grc">καὶ τω̑νδ</foreign>', though inadmis­ <lb/>
            sible, is worth recording for its real <lb/>
            ingenuity.</p>
          <p>1210. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ΛΟΦΟΠΟΙΟΣ</foreign>. I have named the <lb/>
            speakers in the ensuing dialogue, as they <lb/>
            are named substantially in the MSS. and <lb/>
            in all the editions down to and including <lb/>
            Bergk's. Bergk however thought that <lb/>
            the dialogue with Trygaeus from 1210 to <lb/>
            1264 was carried on by one speaker, an <lb/>
            '<foreign xml:lang="grc">Οπλοποιὸς</foreign> or an '<foreign xml:lang="grc">Οπλοπώλης</foreign>, for which <lb/>
            others have substituted from line 1209 <lb/>
            "<foreign xml:lang="grc">Οπλων κάπηλος</foreign>. He did not indeed <lb/>
            introduce this arrangement into his <lb/>
            own edition ; but it was carried out by <lb/>
            Meineke and most subsequent editors, <lb/>
            the only exceptions, I think, being <lb/>
            Paley, Blaydes, Hall and Geldart, and <lb/>
            Merry. Yet the MSS. are quite unani­ <lb/>
            mous, and are confirmed by the Scholiast, <lb/>
            who on 1210 says <foreign xml:lang="grc">ό λοφοποιὰς ἓρχεται, <lb/>
            καταβοω̑ν Τρυγαίου κ.τ.λ</foreign>,; and on 1225 <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἂλλας δέ έστιν αὖτοςὀλοφυρόμενος</foreign>; and on <lb/>
            1250 <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὖτοςκράν κομίζει δύα</foreign> ; and indeed <lb/>
            line 1250 <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὦ, δυσκάθαρτε δα</foreign>ȋ<foreign xml:lang="grc">μον ὢς μ' <lb/>
            ἀπώλεσας</foreign> seems to postulate the inter­ <lb/>
            vention of a new speaker. And that <lb/>
            a continuous succession of speakers was <lb/>
            quite in the manner of Aristophanes at <lb/>
            this period of his career we see from the <lb/>
            examples in the next extant Comedy, the <lb/>
            Birds. And, supra 545-9, the <foreign xml:lang="grc">λοφοπαιὰς, <lb/>
            ξιφαυργὀς</foreign>, and <foreign xml:lang="grc">δαρυξὰς</foreign> are distinguished <lb/>
            from each other, and not compressed into <lb/>
            a single '<foreign xml:lang="grc">Οπλοπαιάς</foreign>. Moreover this <lb/>
            huddling them all up under a single <lb/>
            name destroys the distinction so clearly <lb/>
            drawn between the manufacturer, the <lb/>
             <pb n="221"/>
            retail dealer, and the non-trader. The <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">λοφοποιὀς</foreign> himself manufactured the <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">λόφοι</foreign>, and therefore nothing is said about <lb/>
            what they had cost him; Trygaeus <lb/>
            alludes merely to the elaborate work­ <lb/>
            manship. The <foreign xml:lang="grc">θωρακοπώλης</foreign> and the <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">κρανοπώλης</foreign> are not manufacturers, they <lb/>
            are merely retail dealers; and their <lb/>
            complaint therefore is of the expense <lb/>
            they incurred in purchasing the articles <lb/>
            which the action of Trygaeus has <lb/>
            rendered unsaleable. The <foreign xml:lang="grc">σαλπιγκτὴς</foreign> <lb/>
            appears to be not a trader at all, but <lb/>
            merely a bandsman who has bought <lb/>
            a military trumpet, now useless. (I do <lb/>
            not know how we should class the <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">δορυξός</foreign>.) So far therefore from thinking <lb/>
            that Bergk's view has such superior <lb/>
            merit as to justify our deserting the <lb/>
            unanimous authority of the MSS., I think <lb/>
            that the MS. arrangement, taken on its <lb/>
            own merits, is in every respect far <lb/>
            superior.</p>

            patible with the speech of the Helmet- <lb/>
            seller, which Trygaens is answering. <lb/>
            Many suggestions have been made to <lb/>
            reconcile the two speeches, the one <lb/>
            which has found most support being <lb/>
            the transfer of the Helmet-seller's <lb/>
            speech to some other person. The best <lb/>
            MSS. as we have seen read <foreign xml:lang="grc">μάθῃς</foreign>and <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀποδώσεται</foreign>. One of these must be <lb/>
            wrong; but the change of <foreign xml:lang="grc">μάθῃς</foreign> into <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">μάθῃ</foreign> necessitates further alterations ; <lb/>
            whilst the change of <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀποδώσε</foreign>[<foreign xml:lang="grc">τα</foreign>]<foreign xml:lang="grc">ι</foreign> into <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀποδώσει</foreign>makes the whole passage clear <lb/>
            and consistent. And even in the next <lb/>
            two lines we have two examples of the <lb/>
            omission of y', since R. and V. are the <lb/>
            only MSS. which insert it after <foreign xml:lang="grc">μηδαμῶς</foreign>, <lb/>
            and R. the only one which omits it after <lb/>

            me to be no sufficient foundation for <lb/>
            Dawes's view. The use of the future <lb/>
            middle does not in any way negative the <lb/>
            coexistence of the future active. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὄ̩δω</foreign> <lb/>
            is merely a contracted form of <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀείδω</foreign>, <lb/>
            both the future middle and the future <lb/>
            active of which are in common use. <lb/>
            There is therefore no a priori presump­ <lb/>
            tion against a future active of <foreign xml:lang="grc">ᾆδω</foreign>, and <lb/>
            two such thoroughly well attested ex­ <lb/>

          <p>In the former edition, there being at that time no translation of the Peace into <lb/>
            English verse, I collected in the Appendix half a dozen poetic versions by various <lb/>
            authors of favourite and isolated scenes. Of these I now retain only two, one by <lb/>
            Professor Eugène Fallex and the other by Henry Hart Milman, Dean of St. Paul's ; <lb/>
            and these I retain because Fallex and Milman were the only two authors cited who <lb/>
            were then living, and their kindness in allowing me to cite their versions is <lb/>
            gratefully acknowledged in the Introduction. The first passage is taken from the <lb/>
            “Theâtre d'Aristophane ; scenes traduites en vers français par Eugène Fallex, <lb/>
            Professeur de seconde au Lycée Napoleon. Deuxième edition. Durand, Paris, <lb/>
