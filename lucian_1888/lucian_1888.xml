          </head>
          <p>FOR the few ascertained facts in the life of the greatest <lb/>
            prose satirist and most brilliant wit of Greek and Latin <lb/>
            antiquity, we are indebted, almost wholly, to scattered and <lb/>
            incidental allusions in his own various writings.</p>
          <p>Like his immediate predecessor, Menippus the satirist; <lb/>
            the illustrious Neo-Platonist, Porphyry, in the third; and <lb/>
            the orator, Libanius, in the fourth century, Lucian was <lb/>
            Syrian by birth. He was born at Samosata—its heap of <lb/>
            ruins still retains the old name almost unchanged-on the <lb/>
            Euphrates, not far distant from Edessa, and the chief <lb/>
            city of the district of Kommagene, in the extreme north­ <lb/>
            east of Syria, about the year 120 A.D. Tradition protracts <lb/>
            the term of his existence to the age of ninety, or even of <lb/>
            one hundred years. He thus lived through the reigns of <lb/>
            Hadrian, the two Antonines, and Commodns, and (at all <lb/>
            events) the earlier part of the reign of Severus—alto­ <lb/>
            gether the happiest period of the Roman Empire, and <lb/>
            one of the most interesting ages in the world's his­ <lb/>
            tory. Of his earlier life, the brief record supplied <lb/>
            in his incomplete autobiographical sketch, the Dream, <lb/>
            so often has been repeated, that it is not necessary to <lb/>
            do more than to refer to it here. It is enough briefly to <lb/>
            repeat that the deliberations of a family council deter­ <lb/>
            mined his parents, who were in poor circumstances, to <lb/>
            apprentice him, at the age of fifteen, to his maternal uncle, <lb/>
            a statuary, for whose art he had shown some boyish incli­ <lb/>
            nation ; that, by a fortunate accident-fortunate, at least, <lb/>
            for the world of literary, if not of plastic, Art-the breaking <lb/>
            of a piece of marble, he was induced to run away from his <lb/>
            master, in resentment at a severe flogging, and to transfer <lb/>
             <pb n="xiv"/>
            his allegiance to Literature (Paideia1) ; or, rather, to <lb/>
            prepare himself, in the first instance, by a severe course <lb/>
            of training, for the profession of a rhetor (in modern <lb/>
            phrase, a public speaker), which eventually led him to em­ <lb/>
            brace the career of philosophy and letters.</p>
          <p>At this very early stage his memoir, unhappily, comes <lb/>
            to an end, and we are left to incidental remarks in his more <lb/>
            considerable productions. His experiences for some years <lb/>
            lay in the hard school of poverty and neglect (<foreign xml:lang="grc">πένηςκαὶ</foreign>) <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀφανής</foreign>). In search of employment, or, rather, to master <lb/>
            the rudiments of his profession, the young Lucian wain­ <lb/>
            dered through the cities of the south-western region <lb/>
            of the Lesser Asia, the celebrated and highly-cultured <lb/>
            Ionia, gradually getting rid of his provincial manner and <lb/>
            dialect, but still conspicuous by his Syrian (or, as he calls <lb/>
            it, Assyrian) and un-Greek style of dress (The Twice- <lb/>
            Accused, 27). In his twentieth year he arrived in Greece, <lb/>
            and made his first acquaintance with the Platonic philo­ <lb/>
            sopher Nigrinus, who gives the title to one of his Dialogues. <lb/>
            He next settled in the Syrian capital, Antioch, where he <lb/>
            practised at the bar, and acquired considerable reputation <lb/>
            as a pleader ; but the chicanery and frauds of the inter­ <lb/>
            preters of the laws soon caused him to abandon that pur­ <lb/>
            suit (The Fisherman, 29). The skill thus gained he turned <lb/>
            to lucrative account as travelling disputant (sophistes, as it <lb/>
            was termed)-a popular and profitable calling, which was as <lb/>
            common in the philosophic Hellenic and Roman world in the <lb/>
            second century, A.D., as it was in Scholastic Europe of the <lb/>
            Middle Ages. In that capacity he traversed Syria and Egypt. <lb/>
            Soon afterwards he visited Rome (in the year 150), among <lb/>
            other reasons, to consult an oculist; and in his Nigrinus, <lb/>
            the literary result of his visit, he stigmatizes the prevail­ <lb/>
            ing corruptions and laborious trifling of the literary as <lb/>
            well as fashionable society of the capital. After a stay of <lb/>
            two years in Italy, he proceeded to southern Gaul, at that <lb/>
            time, and long previously, celebrated for its schools of <note type="footnote"> 1 The fine allegory of the rivalry of Paideia and Techne (" Trade ") <lb/>
            may have been suggested to him, in part, by the charming idyll of <lb/>
            Moschus (in which Europe and Asia appear in a dream to the daughter <lb/>
            of Kadmus, and contend for her possession), as well as by the Choice of <lb/>
            Herakles of Prodikus and Xenophon. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="xv"/>
            rhetoric. In Gaul he continued his profession of public <lb/>
            lecturer for some ten years, his residence in that country <lb/>
            being interrupted only by a visit to Olympia. During <lb/>
            this period, probably, he composed many of his published <lb/>
            rhetorical pieces.</p>
          <p>Having now secured an independent income, at the age <lb/>
            of forty, Lucian set out again on his travels, and made a <lb/>
            journey through Macedonia and Thessaly, on his way to <lb/>
            his Syrian home. His stay at Samosata was only tempo­ <lb/>
            rary ; and, inducing his surviving family to remove to <lb/>
            Athens, in the next year he himself followed them to the <lb/>
            literary metropolis, which to him, as to every Greek <lb/>
            or phil-Hellenist, doubtless was an object of supreme <lb/>
            intellectual curiosity. It was on his journey to Athens <lb/>
            that he had the interview with the Paphlagonian prophet, <lb/>
            Alexander, which gave birth to his satire of that name. <lb/>
            The contempt openly exhibited by him for that eminent <lb/>
            miracle-worker had almost, as he assures us (Alex. 56, 57), <lb/>
            cost him his life : for the exasperated Alexander had <lb/>
            secretly instructed the crew of the vessel, which he had <lb/>
            insidiously placed at his visitor's disposal, to make away <lb/>
            with their charge-a conspiracy frustrated only by the <lb/>
            interposition of the relenting captain. Thus saved from a <lb/>
            premature and inglorious end, he proceeded on his journey <lb/>
            to Athens, accompanied by that extraordinary adventurer, <lb/>
            Peregrinus, or Peregrinus Proteus, whose fiery immolation <lb/>
            of himself (like that of another Hercules Furens), be­ <lb/>
            fore the assembled multitude at Olympia, witnessed by <lb/>
            Lucian, in the year 165, forms the principal subject of the <lb/>
            Peregrinus.</p>
          <p>At Athens Lucian seems-for there is no positive evi­ <lb/>
            dence—to have taken up his fixed abode for the greater <lb/>
            part of his remaining life, occupying himself, as may safely <lb/>
            be conjectured, in the highest philosophical and literary <lb/>
            studies, and in the enjoyment of the friendship of such <lb/>
            exceptional philosophers as Celsus, the famous Platonist- <lb/>
            critic of nascent Christianity (in his True Account, known <lb/>
            to us only through the Reply of Origen, published fifty <lb/>
            years later), of the Stoic Sostratus, and the Eclectic Be­ <lb/>
            monax. His sketch of the career of the last, a meritorious <lb/>
            ethical teacher, forms one of the not rare proofs of his <lb/>
             <pb n="xvi"/>
            esteem for real goodness.1 During this period appeared <lb/>
            his masterpieceshis principal theological, philosophical, <lb/>
            and ethical Dialogues—when that consummate skill in the <lb/>
            management of the marvellous Attic dialect had been <lb/>
            attained which rivals the style of the best masters, and <lb/>
            which, as the acquisition of a foreigner, excites the admira­ <lb/>
            tion of all his editors and critics. Perhaps the only other <lb/>
            equally remarkable instance of such kind of excellence is <lb/>
            that of the African Terence.</p>
          <p>When about the age of seventy, impelled, it would seem, <lb/>
            by imminent poverty-for authors, then, even of the highest <lb/>
            reputation fell very far short of obtaining from the Sosii <lb/>
            of the day the immense pecuniary profits now often secured <lb/>
            by ephemeral writers—Lucian once more resumed his old <lb/>
            occupation of rhetor or sophist, and produced some of those <lb/>
            declamatory essays which appear among his published <lb/>
            works. At a fortunate moment, he found relief from his <lb/>
            pecuniary difficulties in an official income derived from his <lb/>
            appointment to the registrarship or clerkship of the law- <lb/>
            courts of the Egyptian capital, the presentation to which <lb/>
            office has variously been assigned to Marcus Aurelius, <lb/>
            Commodus, and Severus. Chronology seems, on the whole, <lb/>
            to support the claims of the last prince, who became em­ <lb/>
            peror in 193, to the honour of saving from destitution the <lb/>
            greatest literary ornament of the century. To clear him­ <lb/>
            self from the charge of teaching one thing (in his satire, On <lb/>
            Hired Dependants) and practising another, by way of sup­ <lb/>
            plement to that essay he published his Apology. From it, <lb/>
            incidentally, we learn that he derived a large salary (<foreign xml:lang="grc">πολυτά­ <lb/>
            λαντος</foreign>) from his legal post. He alleges the forcible argu­ <lb/>
            ment that, as the Imperial master of the Roman legions <lb/>
            himself-not to mention numerous less exalted personages <lb/>
            -by no means refused the richest emoluments of office, <note type="footnote">1 The most interesting, and most meritorious, fact recorded in the life <lb/>
            of this highly interesting philosopher, who inclined in opinion chiefly to <lb/>
            the School of Plato, in practice to that of Antisthenes, is his fine remon­ <lb/>
            strance addressed to the people of Athens, who were contemplating the <lb/>
            introduction of the cruel " sports" of the Roman amphitheatres. <lb/>
            “ Refrain, Athenians," he protested, " from voting this, until you have <lb/>
            first pulled down your altar erected to Pity " (Dem. 51). See, too, his <lb/>
            very rational remark on sacrifices (Dem. 6). </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="xvii"/>
            he, the starving critic, could scarcely be blamed for fol­ <lb/>
            lowing-in a very humble fashion, and at a very long inter­ <lb/>
            val—that elevated example For the most part, his official <lb/>
            duties at Alexandria he devolved upon a deputy, so that <lb/>
            his learned leisure was little disturbed at Athens, where, <lb/>
            as already stated, he died at an advanced age, but at what <lb/>
            date is quite uncertain.</p>
          <p>Such are the somewhat meagre facts collected from his <lb/>
            writings. To these his earlier biographers or critics, led <lb/>
            by the lexicographer Suidas, have been pleased to make <lb/>
            some sensational and apocryphal additions. Suidas, of <lb/>
            whom nothing is known except that he belongs to a <lb/>
            very late date in Byzantine literary history, having, pro­ <lb/>
            bably, in mind the story of the tragic end of the infidel <lb/>
            Euripides, assures his readers that the " blasphemer" <lb/>
            found a well-merited end in having been torn to pieces by <lb/>
            wild dogs ; and, not content with so unique a termination <lb/>
            to his earthly career, adds, as to his posthumous existence, <lb/>
            " in the future, with Satan, he will have his portion in <lb/>
            eternal fire." Another equally discreet authority, of the <lb/>
            sixteenth century, Raffaelle Maffei (or Volaterranus, as he <lb/>
            is called from his birthplace), avers that he was a mali­ <lb/>
            cious apostate from Christianity, attributing to him the <lb/>
            bon mot, that he had gained nothing from his old creed but <lb/>
            change of name—Lucianus in place of Lucius (or Lykinus). <lb/>
            To these and similar mendacious assertions Erasmus re­ <lb/>
            plies, " they attached to him the name of blasphemer, that <lb/>
            is, 'evil-speaker;' but they who did so, one may be sure, <lb/>
            were those whose festering sores he had probed." To his <lb/>
            bitter and persistent satirical assaults upon the established <lb/>
            religion, and upon the contending sects of (so-called) “ phi­ <lb/>
            losophy,” we may be sure, not a few (ephemeral) replies <lb/>
            appeared : but no notices of them have come down to <lb/>
            us. While, however, the last echoes of pagan sacerdotal <lb/>
            or sectarian animosity, excited by his exposures, died away <lb/>
            at the establishment of Christianity, orthodox zeal, on the <lb/>
            other side, even still sometimes regards him as the declared <lb/>
            enemy of the Christian faith. The hostility of the earlier <lb/>
            Christian authorities had been aroused, in particular, by <lb/>
            two very famous Dialogues—the Peregrinus and the Philo­ <lb/>
            patris (" The Patriot”). As for the latter, it has been proved, <lb/>
             <pb n="xviii"/>
            beyond reasonable doubt, to have been the production of <lb/>
            a much later writer, bearing the same name as the reputed <lb/>
            author; while, as for the former, the chief offence origi­ <lb/>
            nated in a mistaken reading or interpretation of the text, <lb/>
            where allusion is made to the Founder of Christianity.1 <lb/>
            In fact, the brief allusions of the Greek satirist to the new <lb/>
            faith seem to discover less hostility than is displayed in <lb/>
            his ridicule of the rival Oriental creeds, of the established <lb/>
            religion itself, or of the popular systems of philosophy and <lb/>
            ethics.</p>
          <p>If Lucian has been thus vilified by the ignorance or <lb/>
            malice of critics of early days, on the other hand, from the <lb/>
            first moment of his resurrection, at the restoration of <lb/>
            learning-from the first appearance of the editio princess, <lb/>
            in 1496—he received an enthusiastic recognition of his <lb/>
            rare merits from the best scholars of the time. Among <lb/>
            them towers conspicuously the illustrious Erasmus, one of <lb/>
            the earliest translators (1514), in conjunction with Sir <lb/>
            Thomas More, of the great master of Ridicule, whom he <lb/>
            himself so admirably imitates in his Encomium Moriæ <note type="footnote"> 1. According to the text of Hemsterhuis and Lehmann, the especially <lb/>
            significant and highly interesting passage in question-by many critics <lb/>
            believed to have been purposely mutilated-reads as follows :—“ At <lb/>
            which time, he [Peregrinus] made himself thoroughly master of the <lb/>
            wonderful philosophy of the Christians, associating, in Palestine, with <lb/>
            their priests and scribes. And-for what need of details -in a short <lb/>
            time he brought them to be all mere children in his hands, aspiring to <lb/>
            the character of prophet, to be president of their public services, and COIl­ <lb/>
            vener of their Assemblies (<foreign xml:lang="grc">θιασάρχης καὶ ξυναγωγεὺς</foreign>), and he was, in fact, <lb/>
            all in all to them. Of their books some he interpreted and expounded, <lb/>
            many of them even he himself wrote ; and they regarded him in the <lb/>
            light of some divine being, set him up as their legislator, and chose <lb/>
            and publicly acknowledged him as their special patron [here occurs the <lb/>
            suspected hiatus. They, in fact, worship that great man who was <lb/>
            crucified in Palestine, because of his introducing into the world this new <lb/>
            religious mystery (<foreign xml:lang="grc">τελετην</foreign>).”— On the Death of Peregrinus, 11. For <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">μέγαν</foreign> his earlier Christian critics seem to have read <foreign xml:lang="grc">μάγον</foreign> ("magician"), <lb/>
            a reading which is approved by Gesner; while to the epithet " won­ <lb/>
            derful" has been assigned an ironical meaning. Of Peregrinus a more <lb/>
            favourable account is given by Gellius (no very high authority), and <lb/>
            Ammianus Marcellinus (a late writer), as well as by the Christian <lb/>
            writers Athenagoras and Tertullian. The Philopatris (in which satirical <lb/>
            allusion is made to the visions of St. Paul) is assigned to the year 363, the <lb/>
            date of the Emperor Julian's Persian expedition. Cf. Philopseudes. 16. </note> <lb/>

            (“Praise of Folly"), and, not altogether so happily, in his <lb/>
            Colloquies. Citing the well-known verse of the Latin satirist­ <lb/>
            poet, <lb/>
            Omne tulit punctum qui miscuit utile dulci, <lb/>
            he protests :—" no one, if not Lucian, has succeeded in illus­ <lb/>
            trating this truth. He has imitated the raillery, without <lb/>
            copying the wantonness, of the Old Comedy. Gracious <lb/>
            heaven ! [deum immortalem is his strong expletive of admira­ <lb/>
            tion], with what sly humour, with what grace and elegance, <lb/>
            he touches everything ! With what power of sarcasm he <lb/>
            holds up every folly to ridicule, how he seasons everything <lb/>
            with his wonderful wit—touching no absurdity that he does <lb/>
            not cover with some irony or satire ! Such grace," con­ <lb/>
            tinues Erasmus, echoing the dictum of Archbishop Photius, <lb/>
            " dominates in his style, there is so much felicity of inven­ <lb/>
            tion, so much elegance in his wit, such pungency in his more <lb/>
            serious assaults; he so tickles with his allusions, so mingles <lb/>
            the grave with the gay, in such a way does he enunciate <lb/>
            truth with a smile, so admirably does he picture the <lb/>
            manners, the characters, the pursuits of men, as it were, <lb/>
            with a painter's pencil; in such a manner does he display <lb/>
            things which we can not only read but actually see, that <lb/>
            whether one regards entertainment, or utility and instruc­ <lb/>
            tion, there is no comedy, no satire, that has a right to be <lb/>
            put in competition with his Dialogues." At the beginning <lb/>
            of the sixteenth century, at least, this high eulogy was <lb/>
            scarcely an exaggeration.</p>
          <p>Among the Dialogues translated (into Latin) by Erasmus, <lb/>
            it is interesting to note, are the Timon and the Alexander; <lb/>
            by More (who, as an ecclesiastical zealot, and as Lord Chan­ <lb/>
            cellor, so soon forgot the spirit of his author, and the <lb/>
            principles of his own Utopia), the Menippus, the Philo­ <lb/>
            pseudes (" The Lover of Lies "), and the Tyrannicide. Even <lb/>
            Melancthon, the associate of Luther in the Reformation <lb/>
            struggle in Germany, assisted in the work of annotating the <lb/>
            great sceptic (1527). Rabelais, although there is no evi­ <lb/>
            dence that he took part in illustrating so congenial a mind, <lb/>
            must have been greatly indebted to him. Early in the next <lb/>
            century (1615) his most considerable French editor, Bour­ <lb/>
            delot, enthusiastically maintains that, " in proportion as the <lb/>
             <pb n="xx"/>
            influence of Lucian's writings was diffused, the love of <lb/>
            knowledge and virtue increased, which still resides in the <lb/>
            hearts of a few ;” and goes so far as to affirm that by such <lb/>
            influence the culture, and even civilization, of the philoso­ <lb/>
            pher s native country perceptibly benefited in the succeeding <lb/>
            age. A Dutch critic, Hoogstraaten, believes him to have <lb/>
            been not only the greatest genius of his own age, but even <lb/>
            of all antiquity. These high eulogiums, for the most part, <lb/>
            have been repeated by later critics to the days of Hemster­ <lb/>
            huis and Reitz (whose judicious settlement of the text, and <lb/>
            criticism and summary of the labours of preceding editors <lb/>
            and annotators, respectively, first made to the world a <lb/>
            worthy presentation of his genuine and attributed produc­ <lb/>
            tions), and by competent judges of our own time. The <lb/>
            English historian of Greek Literature, J. W. Donaldson, <lb/>
            holds that “his merits can scarcely be over-estimated," <lb/>
            and considering him with reference to his own age, and <lb/>
            to the Literature of Greece," justly adds the learned his­ <lb/>
            torian, “a position of the utmost importance must be <lb/>
            assigned to him, both in regard to the systems of religion <lb/>
            and of philosophy to which he gave the death-blow, and <lb/>
            in respect to the cultivation of a purer style which <lb/>
            he vainly taught and exemplified.” During the sixteenth <lb/>
            century sixty-five editions (in Greek or Latin), in the <lb/>
            seventeenth twenty-two, in the eighteenth forty-four (be­ <lb/>
            sides translations), bore ample witness to the estimation <lb/>
            in which he was held by the learned world. In England <lb/>
            the first edition of him (and that only in part) did not <lb/>
            appear till 1677. The first version (in part) in 1634. No <lb/>
            English translation of any pretension appeared till that <lb/>
            of Carr (1775-1798), a spirited, but extremely free, presen­ <lb/>
            tation of him, which was followed by that of Franklin <lb/>
            Professor of Greek at Cambridge (1780), and of Tooke <lb/>
            (1820) Franklin's, although not very faithful or accu­ <lb/>
            rate, being altogether the most valuable of the three chief <lb/>
            English presentations of Lucian. Of French translations, <lb/>
            lalbot s sions, (1857) has the greatest repute. Of German ver­ <lb/>
            that of Wieland, the well-known poet and romancist <lb/>
            (1788), is easily first; and, indeed, it is generally held to <lb/>
            be entitled to the foremost place among all attempts at a <lb/>
            modern representation of the Greek wit.</p><pb n="xxi"/>
            
          <p>Lucian is almost encyclopædic in the extent and rarity <lb/>
            of his productions — critic, moralist, philosopher, poli­ <lb/>
            tician, poet, romancist, litterateur. Of the eighty-four <lb/>
            separate writings attributed to him, and published in the <lb/>
            editions of his works, not a few find an undeserved place <lb/>
            there. Some pieces of inferior merit are the production of <lb/>
            his earlier rhetorical period, and show sufficiently evident <lb/>
            traces of the stilted style characteristic of the fashionable <lb/>
            declamatory essay, as well in matter as in manner. Of his <lb/>
            undoubted productions, the shorter pieces—Dialogues of <lb/>
            the Gods, of the Sea-Gods, and of the Dead—by reason of <lb/>
            their popular subject-matter and peculiar graces of style, <lb/>
            have always been most generally read. His more con­ <lb/>
            siderable masterpieces are Zeus the Tragedian, the Sale <lb/>
            of Lives, the Timon, the Ferry Boat, the Twice Accused, the <lb/>
            Fisherman, the Fugitives, the Banquet, the Convicted Zeus, <lb/>
            the Convention of the Gods, the Charon, the Icaro-Menippus, <lb/>
            the True History, the Prometheus, the Philopseudes, How <lb/>
            History Ought to be Written (the first attempt at a philo­ <lb/>
            sophy of history, but not of sustained merit throughout), <lb/>
            the Peregrinus, On Sacrifices, On Mourning, and the Alex­ <lb/>
            ander. In the Greek Anthology twenty Epigrams are ascribed <lb/>
            to a writer bearing the name of Lucian. Whether the <lb/>
            composition of the Lucian or not, they are by no means <lb/>
            unworthy of his genius,1 and they are among the best in <lb/>
            the whole extensive Collection.</p>
          <p>It is his theological Dialogues that have most contributed <note type="footnote"> 1 Especially admirable are those numbered ix., XIII., xcvi. (Westmin­ <lb/>
            ster Selection); XXXVIII., LX., LXII., LXIII. (Eton Selection); XXXII., <lb/>

            E. g.:—“ The wealth of the soul is the only true wealth " (xx., Ed. S.). <lb/>
            " Let a seal on words not to be spoken lie on the tongue. A careful <lb/>
            watch over words is better than one over wealth " (XL .,Ed. S.). "Address <lb/>
            to the Gout:”—“O Goddess! who hatest the Poor, and art the sole <lb/>
            subduer of wealth, who knowest how to live ‘ well' at all times, thou <lb/>
            delightest to be supported on strange feet, and knowest how to wear <lb/>
            shoes of felt, and ointments are a care to thee. Thee, too, garlands <lb/>
            delight, and the liquor of the Ausonian Bacchus. But these things <lb/>
            never exist, at any time, for the Poor. And, therefore, thou fliest from <lb/>
            the threshold of Poverty, that has no gold, and art delighted, on the <lb/>
            other hand, in coming to the feet of Wealth" (XXXII., Ed. S.). This. <lb/>

            to his fame. The inimitable Hellenic arts of architecture <lb/>
            and of sculputre which adorned, disguised, and, in some <lb/>
            measure, served to redeem the character of the religion of <lb/>
            Zeus, or Jupiter, had long shown symptoms of decay, the <lb/>
            outward and visible sign of a corresponding coolness in the <lb/>
            " religious ” feeling of the upper classes ; but the religion <lb/>
            of Homer and Hesiod still kept fast hold of the affections <lb/>
            of the body of the peoples (as it continued to do, in fact, <lb/>
            throughout the country districts, longafter the State <lb/>
            recognition of Christianity), while the great majority of <lb/>
            the educated or influential sections of society regarded it <lb/>
            as a useful means of retaining the masses in subjection.1 <lb/>
            To undermine this imposing structure of mingled fraud <lb/>
            and imposture, the absurdities, the follies, and the hypo­ <lb/>
            crisies of its various adherents, Lucian especially devoted <lb/>
            his almost unrivalled powers of wit and sarcasm ; and, if <lb/>
            ridicule could inflict a mortal wound, he might have been <lb/>
            well satisfied with his brilliant efforts. But reflection on <lb/>
            the history of the Past must sometimes have inspired him <lb/>
            with some misgiving, or even despair. For he was far <lb/>
            from having been the first to expose the character of the <lb/>
            orthodox Theology. In the drama, the most popular form <lb/>
            of literature in Hellas—in Tragedy, Euripides (of the school <lb/>
            of Sokrates) had, in the latter half of the fourth century, <lb/>
            given expression to the more rational belief of the best­ <lb/>
            educated minds of the time; in Comedy, the conservative <lb/>
            Aristophanes, in his inimitable dramas, whether purposely <lb/>
            or not, had held up to the most open and undisguised <lb/>
            contempt the most sacred objects of the national and <lb/>
            popular worship. In the two next centuries Scepticism <lb/>
            was rampant. In the lighter forms of literature, the Mimes <lb/>
            (" parodies ") of Sophron of Syrakuse, and the bitter <lb/>
            satires (silloi, as they were termed) of Timon of Phlius, a <lb/>
            disciple of Pyrrho, whose name has given a synonym for <lb/>
            the extremest scepticism, held up to derision the occupants <lb/>
            of the national Pantheon. Such rationalistic writers, too, <lb/>
            as Euhemerus, author of the Sacred Inscriptions; Palæ­ <lb/>
            phatus, author of the Incredible Legends; and, in parti­ <lb/>
            cular, Menippus, were direct predecessors of the satirist of <note type="footnote"> 1 For instances of this doctrine of Expediency, see the remarkably <lb/>
            candid admissions of Polybius and of Strabo. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="xxiii"/>
            Samosata. But these more popular writers were not the <lb/>
            only assailants of the Pagan Pantheon : and it is enough <lb/>
            merely to mention the names of Anaxagoras, Xenophanes, <lb/>
            Demokritus, Zeno (the founder of the Stoic School), <lb/>
            Antisthenes (the founder of the most practical satirists, <lb/>
            the Cynics), and, above all, Epikurus, to recall their wide <lb/>
            divergences from, and sometimes direct assaults on, <lb/>
            the Olympian theology. -To Lucian, however, as to Vol­ <lb/>
            taire, in the last century, was reserved, in very special <lb/>
            degree, the work of popularizing and bringing within the <lb/>
            reach of the most ordinary intelligence the various labours <lb/>
            of his predecessors. Of his models in the Dialogue form of <lb/>
            writing, Plato and Xenophon are most commonly quoted: <lb/>
            but the eloquent founder of the Academy, and the author <lb/>
            of the Œconomicus, rather improved than originated it. <lb/>
            Sophron of Syracuse, and Zeno of Elea in Italy, had already <lb/>
            brought it into use. In the following century, Antisthenes <lb/>
            also employed it.</p>
          <p>As for the ethical character of Lucian, if we may trust <lb/>
            to his own representation of himself, it deserves high <lb/>
            praise. In the Dream, among the superior advantages <lb/>
            offered by Paideia, he gives prominent place to the virtues <lb/>
            of justice, mildness, and reasonableness. In his Revived <lb/>
            Philosophers, he declares himself to be a hater of falsehood, <lb/>
            of imposture, of arrogance, of pride, a lover of truth, of <lb/>
            beauty, of sincerity, and all things lovely (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ὅσα τῷ φιλει̃σθαι <lb/>
            συγγενη̃</foreign>). He abandoned the profession of the Law from <lb/>
            disgust for its iniquity, or for the fraudulent methods of <lb/>
            its practisers. He engages, as he declares, in the war against <lb/>
            Falsehood quite conscious that he is fighting a desperate <lb/>
            battle-that the vast majority are against him (Fisher­ <lb/>
            man, 20). In his biography of his friend, Demonax, his <lb/>
            appreciation of that superior Cynic exhibits him as a <lb/>
            sympathetic admirer of true worth. In one department of <lb/>
            Morals—on the assumption of his having been the author <lb/>
            of the scandalous Erotes (“Loves”)—he has been made the <lb/>
            subject of undeserved censure; for its tedious dulness and <lb/>
            its frigid and sophisticated tone, alike foreign to Lucian's <lb/>
            manner, prove it to be spurious.</p>
          <p>It has been sometimes objected to Lucian's philosophical <lb/>
            claims, that he made no attempt to build anew upon the ruins <lb/>
             <pb n="xxiv"/>
            of the religious system overthrown by him. But, in the first <lb/>
            place, systems of "faith," or “morals,” already abounded <lb/>
            ad nauseam, and to have erected another system of " philo­ <lb/>
            sophy " would have been only to add to the existing confu­ <lb/>
            sion. The work immediately and urgently needed was <lb/>
            that of complete destruction, and the clearing of the ground <lb/>
            for the future dissemination of higher and no bIer ideas. <lb/>
            This he did-at all events, as far as religionism and meta­ <lb/>
            physical shams were concerned-with the persistent zeal <lb/>
            of a sincere reformer. In the second place, if the charge <lb/>
            be a substantial one, he shares the blame with almost every <lb/>
            destructive critic of after ages, whose opportunities for <lb/>
            establishing better faiths have been superior to his. The <lb/>
            charge to which he is more justly open-and it is the <lb/>
            only grave fault, perhaps, in his writings-is indiscrimi­ <lb/>
            nation in his assaults on the philosophies of the day. His, <lb/>
            apparently, contemptuous treatment, in particular, of Pytha­ <lb/>
            goreanism, the parent of Platonism, and the philosophical <lb/>
            school which was most productive of examples of the <lb/>
            higher virtues as well as of intellectual ability, deserves <lb/>
            censure. In his Sale of Lives, in the Revived Philosophers, <lb/>
            and in one of the Dialogues of the Dead in particular, he <lb/>
            seems to have yielded to the temptation-a sort of tempta­ <lb/>
            tion to which great wits have always been liable-of utilizing <lb/>
            matter so promising as the ridiculous fables which the ene­ <lb/>
            mies of Pythagoreanism abundantly supplied.1 That among <lb/>
            the (self-styled) followers of Pythagoras were to be found <lb/>
            some pretenders, and not a few extravagant expositors of <lb/>
            his teaching-as such are found in all societies or sects— <lb/>
            is sufficiently probable; but to hold up indiscriminately to <lb/>
            ridicule what was, in the main, a meritorious system of <lb/>
            (ethical) philosophy-that, certainly, did not become the <lb/>
            character of a just critic. He lived, indeed, before the <lb/>
            appearance of the School of New or Newer Platonism, <note type="footnote"> 1 In the Sale or Auction of Lives, Pythagoras, who responds to the <lb/>
            inquiries of the bidder, as to his qualifications, that he does " not eat <lb/>
            the flesh of animals, but everything else except beans," is sold at the <lb/>
            price of forty pounds. Epikurus (to whose school, if to any, Lucian <lb/>

            whose founders, Plotinus, Ammonins, and Porphyry (the <lb/>

            following century. Extravagant as may have been some of <lb/>
            their speculations, the New-Platonists, by their noble, if <lb/>
            hopelessly futile, attempts to reform and spiritualize the <lb/>
            established religion, and by their noble protests against the <lb/>
            gross practical Materialism of life, have deserved (equally <lb/>
            with the early Christians), among the various contending <lb/>
            sects of religion or philosophy, very high esteem. Had he <lb/>
            witnessed their self-denying lives, and been acquainted with <lb/>

            real merits, as distinguished from the errors of judgment <lb/>
            which lay on the surface, and which were the inevitable <lb/>
            outcome of the scientific defects of the age.</p>
          <p>The present volume includes what may be termed the <lb/>
            principal theological Dialogues. In the spelling of Greek <lb/>
            names, in the transitional and unsettled state of Greek <lb/>
            orthography in this country, any attempt to adopt a more <lb/>
            natural method must, necessarily, be a compromise : hence <lb/>
            the present version is open to the charge of some ortho­ <lb/>
            graphical inconsistency. As for the translation itself, the <lb/>
            method adopted has been to adhere as closely to the ori­ <lb/>
            ginal as essential differences of idiom allow : to represent <lb/>
            Lucian's peculiar graces of style no translator can reason­ <lb/>
            ably aspire. The versions, entire or partial, which have <lb/>
            appeared up to this time, however spirited they may be-­ <lb/>
            and the German Wieland surpasses all his rivals in this <lb/>
            respect, in whose hands, as Lehmann expresses it, “all <lb/>
            Lucian lives and breathes "-for the most part are not <lb/>
            distinguished by any very strict fidelity to their original. <lb/>
            The text followed is that of the great work of Hemsterhuis <lb/>
            and Reitz (in Lehmann's edition), which has been com­ <lb/>
            pared with the alternative readings adopted by Jacobitz.</p>

          <p>Prometheus. Yet you shall not release me without recom­ <lb/>

          <p>Zeus. You are for outwitting me, Prometheus.</p>
          <p>Prometheus. And what advantage should I gain ? For <lb/>
            you will not be ignorant hereafter of the whereabouts of <lb/>

            so much importance to us.</p>
          <p>Prometheus. If I tell you for what purpose you are now <lb/>

            prophesy about the rest ?</p>

          <p>Prometheus. Don't have anything to do with the Nereid, <lb/>

            will treat you exactly as you, too, treated</p>

            Ida; and you from this place-for you are now enrolled <lb/>

            father and to your country; and, instead of cheese and <lb/>
            milk, you will eat ambrosia and drink nectar: this latter, <lb/>

            mortal, but shall become immortal, and I will make your <lb/>

          <p>Ganymedes. And if I want to play, who will play with <lb/>

            pleasanter to you to sleep with me ?</p>
          <p>Zeus. Yes, with such an one as you, Ganymede, so hand­ <lb/>
            some as you are.</p>
          <p>Ganymedes. Why, how will handsome looks give you <lb/>
            pleasure, in respect to sleep ?</p>
          <p>Zeus They have a certain sweet charm, and bring it on <lb/>
            more softly.</p>
          <p>Ganymedes. Yet my father used to be annoyed with me, <lb/>
            when I slept in the same bed with him, and used to tell me <lb/>
            in the morning how I had taken away his sleep by my <lb/>

            which reason he would generally send me to bed with my <lb/>

            insult me, in your cups, on account of this male Hebe of <lb/>
            yours.</p>

            needs act as butler, with his limping gait, coming straight <lb/>
            from his forge, still covered all over with sparks, his fire- <lb/>
            tongs only just laid aside : and from those fingers of his I <lb/>
            had to receive the goblet, and drawing him to me to greet <lb/>
            him with a salute between while, whom not even you, his <lb/>
            mother, would kiss with any pleasure, with his face com­ <lb/>
            pletely blackened with soot.1 The present arrangement is <lb/>
            much more agreeable : for will you say that it is not so ? <lb/>
            That cup-bearer of yours certainly excellently becomes the <lb/>
            table of the gods; while Ganymede must be sent down <lb/>
            back to Ida—for he is clean, and rosy-fingered, and hands <lb/>
            the goblet deftly; and, what most vexes you, gives kisses <lb/>
            more sweet than nectar.</p>
          <p>Hera. Yes. Hephæstus is lame now, and his fingers are <lb/>
            not fit to touch your cup, and he is covered with soot, and <lb/>
            the sight of him turns you sick-ever since Ida produced <lb/>
            that handsome youth with the flowing locks. Yet, for­ <lb/>
            merly, you did not observe these things; neither the sparks <lb/>
            nor the forge turned your stomach so as to prevent your <lb/>

          <p>Zeus. You plague yourself to no purpose, Hera, while <lb/>
            you intensify my love for him by your jealousy. Well, if <lb/>
            you are annoyed at receiving the goblet from a beautiful <lb/>
            boy, let your son pour out your wine, and as for you, <lb/>

          <p>Zeus. A good kind of man, and a boon companion: for <lb/>

          <p>Hera. Insolence ? and what else—I blush, however, to <lb/>
            mention it, such was his daring impertinence.</p>
          <p>Zeus. Yet that is the more reason you should tell me, <lb/>
            in proportion to the baseness of his attempt. Surely he <lb/>
            has not attempted any one's virtue, has he ? For I under­ <lb/>

          <p>Hera. On mine, and no one else's has he made his assaults, <lb/>
            now for a long time past. At first I was ignorant of the <lb/>
            reason why he kept staring fixedly at me, while he would <lb/>
            sigh and secretly drop a tear; and whenever, after drinking, <lb/>

            it between while, and put it to his eyes, and again stare at <lb/>
            me. These actions I now began to perceive to be amorous <lb/>
            signs. For a long time I felt ashamed to speak to you, <lb/>
            and thought that the fellow would cease from his mad <lb/>

          <p>Zeus, Not at all. But let us form a phantom out of a <lb/>
            cloud like your very self, and when the dinner party is <lb/>
            broken up, and he, as is highly probable, is keeping his <lb/>
            vigils, under the influence of his passion, let us carry it <lb/>
            and lay it down by his side. In this way he would cease <lb/>
            to be plagued; supposing he had had what he wanted.</p>
          <p>Hera. Get away with you. Plague take him for indulg­ <lb/>
            in- hopes beyond his station.1</p>
          <p>Zeus. Put up with it, however, my dear Hera, for what <lb/>
            terrible harm could you get from the counterfeit figure, if <lb/>
            Ixion shall have to do with a mere cloud ?</p>
          <p>Hera. Yes, but I shall be supposed to be the cloud, and <lb/>
            he will perpetrate upon me his foul purpose, through the <lb/>
            resemblance.</p>
          <p>Zeus. Your objection is nothing to the purpose. For <lb/>
            neither will the cloud ever be Hera, nor will you be a <lb/>
            cloud, while Ixion will only be deceived.</p>
          <p>Hera. But all men are so vulgar-minded and without <lb/>
            good taste, when he goes down he will, probably, talk big <lb/>
            and recount to everybody that he has enjoyed the favours <lb/>
            of Hera, and shared the bed of Zeus; and, maybe, he will <lb/>
            even assert that I am in love with him; and, not knowing <lb/>
            it was a cloud he was with, they will believe him.</p>
          <p>Zeus. Then, if he should say anything of the kind, the <lb/>
            wretch shall be thrown into hell, be bound to a wheel, and <lb/>
            carried round with it for ever and ever, and shall suffer <lb/>
            everlasting torture, paying the penalty not of his love-for <lb/>
            that, surely, is not so dreadful a crime-but of his loud <lb/>
            boasting.2 <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Μὴ ὥραισιν ἴκοιτο τω̃ν ὑπὲρ αὑτὸν ἐπιθυμω̃ν</foreign>. Cf. Lucian, <foreign xml:lang="grc">Περὶ <lb/>

          </ab>

            <title type="sub">Apollo and Hephœstus.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>Hephœstus. Apollo, have you seen Maia's baby, which <lb/>
            is just born ? What a pretty thing it is, and how it smiles <lb/>
            on every one, and already plainly shows he is going to turn <lb/>
            out some great treasure !</p>
          <p>Apollo. That a baby, or a great treasure, who is older <lb/>
            than Iapetus himself, as far as depends on rascality !</p>
          <p>Hephœstus. And what possible mischief could an infant <lb/>
            just born be able to do ?</p>
          <p>Apollo. Ask Poseidon, whose trident he stole, or Ares; <lb/>
            for even from the latter he abstracted his sword from the <lb/>
            sheath without being found out, not to speak of myself, <lb/>
            whom he disarmed of my bow and arrows.</p>
          <p>Hephcestus. The new-born brat did this, who hardly keeps <lb/>
            on his feet, who is still in his long clothes ?</p>
          <p>Apollo. You will know well enough, Hephæstus, if only <lb/>
            he come near you.</p>
          <p>Hephœstus. Indeed, he already has been near me.</p>
          <p>Apollo. Well, have you all your tools, and is none of <lb/>
            them missing ?</p>
          <p>Hephœstus. All of them are safe, my dear Apollo.</p>
          <p>Apollo. All the same, examine carefully.</p>
          <p>Hephœstus. By heaven ! I don't see myfire-tongs.</p>
          <p>Apollo. No, but you will probably see them among the <lb/>
            infant's swaddling clothes.</p>
          <p>Hephœstus. Is he so light-fingered, for all the world as <lb/>
            though he had mastered the purloining art in his mother's <lb/>
            womb ?</p>
          <p>Apollo. No wonder you ask, for you have not heard his <lb/>
            glib and voluble prattling. He is, besides, quite ready to <lb/>
            wait upon us. And yesterday he challenged Eros, and <lb/>
            wrestled with him and threw him, somehow tripping up <lb/>
            his feet. Then, while he was getting praised for it, he <lb/>
            stole Aphrodite's cestus, as she was folding him to her <lb/>
            breast on account of his victory; and, while he was laugh­ <lb/>
             <pb n="16"/>
            ing, the sceptre of Zeus, also. And, if the thunder-bolt <lb/>
            were not a little too heavy, and had a good deal of fire in <lb/>
            it, he would have filched that too.</p>
          <p>Hephœstus. The child you describe is a regular Gorgon.</p>
          <p>Apollo. Not only so, but already he is a musical genius, <lb/>
            also.</p>
          <p>Hephcestus. From what can you draw your inference as <lb/>
            to that ?</p>
          <p>Apollo. Somewhere or other he found a dead tortoise, <lb/>
            and from it formed a musical instrument: for, having fitted <lb/>
            in the horns (or side-pieces) and joined them by a bar, he <lb/>
            next fixed pegs, and inserted a bridge beneath them; and, <lb/>
            after stretching seven strings upon it, he set about playing <lb/>
            a very pretty and harmonious tune, so that even I, practised <lb/>
            as I have long been in playing the cithara,l envied him. <lb/>
            And Maia assured us that not even his nights would he <lb/>
            pass in heaven, but from mere busybodyness be would de­ <lb/>
            scend as far as Hades, to steal something from thence, I <lb/>
            suppose. He is furnished with wings, and has made for <lb/>
            himself a sort of staff 2of wonderful virtue, with which he <lb/>
            chaperones the souls of dead men, and conducts them <lb/>
            down to the infernal regions.</p>
          <p>Hephœstus. I gave him that for a plaything.</p>
          <p>Apollo. Then he has paid you back: your fire-tongs</p>
          <p>Hephœstus. Well remembered. So I will march off to <lb/>
            recover it, if, as you say, it is anywhere to be found among <lb/>
            his cradle-clothes. <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Κιθαίζειν</foreign>. The cithara differed somewhat from the lyra and <lb/>

            but bring it down with a will, and split my head in two.</p>
          <p>Hephœstus. You are trying me, if I am in my right <lb/>
            senses ? Order, pray, something else, whatever it is you <lb/>
            really want done to you.</p>
          <p>Zeus. I desire my skull to be split open-that and nothing <lb/>

          <p>Hephœstus. 'Tis sorely against my will, but I will down <lb/>

              in armour! A mighty pain you had in your head, Zeus. <lb/>
              With good reason, I admit, you were so short-tempered, <lb/>
              maintaining alive in the pia mater of your brain a virgin of <lb/>
              such proportions, and that too, in a suit of armour! It <lb/>
              was a camp, surely, not a head you have had all this while <lb/>
              without its being known. Why! she leaps and dances the <lb/>
              Pyrrhic dance, and clashes her shield, and brandishes her <lb/>
              spear, and is all on fire with martial excitement; and, <lb/>
              what is more, in this short time, she has become a very <lb/>
              beautiful woman, and is in her full bloom already. She <lb/>
              has a fierceness in her bluish-gray eyes' to be sure, but <lb/>
              her helmet sets off that, too, to advantage. So, Zeus, pay <lb/>
              me my midwife-fee, by betrothing her to me now at once.</p>
          <p>Zeus. You ask impossibilities, Hephæstus, for she chooses <lb/>
            to remain ever a virgin: but I, however, as far as I am <lb/>
            concerned, offer no opposition.</p>
          <p>Hephœstus. That's all I wanted. The rest shall be my <lb/>
            care, and I will carry her off even now.</p>
          <p>Zeus. If you find it an easy affair, do so: but I know <lb/>

            who is this Semele?.</p>
          <p>Hermes. A lady of Thebes, one of the daughters of <lb/>
            Kadmus. He paid her a visit, and made her enceinte.</p>
          <p>Poseidon. Then, did he take her place in the straw,<lb/>

          <p>Hermes. Exactly, however strange and paradoxical it <lb/>
            appears to you. For Hera-you know how jealous she is <lb/>
            –secretly laid a trap for her, and persuaded her to request <lb/>
            from Zeus that he would come to her with thunder and<lb/>
            <lb/>
            lightning. And when he complied, and came with his<lb/>
            thunderbolt, the roof of the house was set all on fire, and<lb/>
            burnt up, and poor Semele perished in the flames. And<lb/>
            <lb/>
            he orders me to cut open the lady's womb, and to bring up<lb/>
            to him the still imperfect embryo of seven months. When<lb/>
            I had so done, he cuts open his own thigh and inserts it,<lb/>
            that it might there receive its completion; and now,<lb/>
            <lb/>
            exactly in the third month, he has given birth to the child<lb/>
            and is feeling poorly after the pangs of parturition.</p>
          <p>Poseidon. Where, then, is the baby now?</p>
          <p>Hermes. I took it off to Nysa, and delivered it to the<lb/>
            Nymphs to bring up, after giving it the name of Dionysus.1</p>
          <p>Poseidon. And is my brother really both father and<lb/>

          <p>Hermes. So it seems. But I am now off to fetch water <lb/>

            are customary, just as for a lady after confinement.2 <note type="footnote"> <lb/>

          <p>Hermes. Why so gloomy and dejected, my dear Apollo ?</p>
          <p>Apollo. Because, Hermes, I am unhappy in my love affairs.</p>
          <p>Hermes. Such misfortune is, indeed, worthy occasion for <lb/>
            grief : but in what affair is it you are unfortunate ? Does <lb/>
            that business of Daphne2 still affect you ?</p>
          <p>Apollo. Not at all. No, I mourn for my favourite, the <lb/>
            Laconian, the son of Œbalus.3</p>
          <p>Hermes. What! tell me, is Hyakinthus dead ?</p>

            Hermes. How ? For I am anxious to hear manner <lb/>

          <p>Apollo. He was learning to play with the quoit, and I <lb/>
            was playing with him. Well, that most cursed of winds,<lb/>
            Zephyrus, himself was in love with him, from a long time , <lb/>
            past; and being neglected, and not able to endure his <lb/>
            superciliousness (while I threw my quoit up into the air, <lb/>
            as we are accustomed to do), blowing down from Taÿgetus, <lb/>
            bore the disc along and caused it to fall on the head of the <lb/>
            youth, so that blood flowed from the wound in large quantity,<lb/>
            and the boy died immediately. However, I at once avenged<lb/>
            myself on Zephyrus by shooting at him with my arrows,<lb/>
            pursuing him in his flight as far as the mountain. And to<lb/>
            the boy I had a tomb raised at Amyklæ, where the quoit<lb/>
            struck him down; and from his blood I caused the ground<lb/>
            to send up a flower, the sweetes, Hermes, and the gayest-<lb/>
            coloured of all flowers, having, moreover, letters mournig1<lb/>
            for the dead imprinted on it. Do I appear to yuo to have<lb/>
            been grieved unreasonably?.</p>
          <p>Hermes. Yes, my dear Apollo : for you knew that you<lb/>
            <lb/>
            had made a mere mortal the object of your particular<lb/>
            affection. So, pray, don't vex yourself about his death. <note type="footnote"> 1 <lb/>

          <p>Hermes. But the fact, Apollo, that, though he is both <lb/>
            lame, and a mere brazier by trade, he has married the <lb/>
            most beautiful wives of us all, Aphrodite and Charts ! 1</p>
          <p>Apollo. A mere piece of good luck, my dear Hermes. <lb/>
            But this I do wonder at-that they tolerate having anything <lb/>
            to do with him; most especially when they see him running <lb/>
            down with perspiration, as he stoops laboriously over his <lb/>
            furnace, and with a quantity of soot upon his face. And <lb/>
            yet, though he is such a figure, they embrace him, and <lb/>
            kiss him, and sleep with him !</p>
          <p>Hermes. This, too, I feel indignant about, and envy <lb/>
            Hephæstus—whereas you wear long, flowing, hair, and <lb/>
            play on the cithara, and pride yourself greatly on your <lb/>
            good looks, and I upon my vigour and good habit of body <lb/>
            and my lyre, straightway, when we have to go to bed, we <lb/>
            shall sleep all alone.</p>
          <p>Apollo. Besides, too, as far as I am concerned, I have no <lb/>
            fortune in my affaires de cœur,2 and two, at all events, <lb/>
            whom I especially loved, Daphne and Hyakinthus—well, <lb/>
            Daphne hated me to such a degree that she chose to become <lb/>
            a tree rather than have my embraces ; while Hyakinthus <lb/>
            I killed with that quoit, and now, in place of them, I have <lb/>
            to be content with garlands.3</p>

            all, how is it. Aphrodite is not jealous of Charts or Charts <lb/>
            jealous of her ?</p>
          <p>Hermes. Because, my dear Apollo, the former lives with <lb/>
            him in Lemnos,1 and Aphrodite in Heaven. And besides, the <lb/>
            latter is, for the most part, taken up with Ares, and is in <lb/>
            love with him, so that she cares little for this brazier fellow.</p>
          <p>Apollo. And do you suppose that Hephæstus knows this?</p>
          <p>Hermes. He knows well enough : but what could he do, <lb/>
            when he sees a fine youth, and that, too, a soldier ? So he <lb/>
            keeps quiet. However, he threatens, at all events, that he <lb/>
            will devise some kind of fetters for them, and catch them <lb/>
            together by throwing a net over their bed.</p>
          <p>Apollo. I don't know, but I would devoutly pray that I <lb/>

            as for your children, one of them is beyond all measure, <lb/>
            masculine, and mountainish, and to crown all, has made off <lb/>
            to Scythia, and everyone knows what her diet is there, <lb/>
            slaying strangers, and imitating the Scythians themselves, <lb/>
            who are cannibals.1 As for Apollo, he makes pretence to <lb/>
            universal knowledge-to shoot with the bow, to play the <lb/>
            cithara, to be a doctor, and to prophesy-and having set up <lb/>
            his oracle-shops, one at Delphi, another at Klaros and at <lb/>
            Didyma, he juggles and cheats those who consult him, <lb/>
            giving crooked answers,2 and double meanings, applicable <lb/>
            to either side of the question, so that he runs no risk of <lb/>
            failure, and from such trickery he makes his fortune : for <lb/>
            numerous are the fools, and those who offer themselves <lb/>
            willing victims to be cheated and imposed upon. But by <lb/>
            the wiser part of men it is not unknown that he is, for the <lb/>
            most part, a mere juggler in words. The prophet himself, <lb/>
            at all events, did not know he would kill his favourite <lb/>
            with the quoit, nor did he divine for his own advantage, <lb/>
            that Daphne would flee from him ; and that, too, although <lb/>

            eloquent description of the most beautiful conception in all remaining <lb/>
            Greek Sculpture, see Shelley's Letters from Italy. As for the miracu­ <lb/>
            lous metamorphosis of Niobe, Pausanias, who had seen the pillar of <lb/>
            stone, considers that there need be no difficulty in believing it, for it <lb/>
            happened in the old times of frequent miraculous interposition of <lb/>
            Heaven. He is not prepared, however, to maintain that such miracles <lb/>
            take place in his own day, for man's impiety precludes the possibility. <lb/>
            Accordingly, he does not credit the received story that the petrified <lb/>
            Niobe sheds tears, or the popular tales about lycanthropy, or that the <lb/>
            Tritons blow through their shells, as the vulgar believe (viii. 2). Cf. <lb/>
            viii. 8. With this expression of pious faith compare, also, the remarks <lb/>
            of Diodorus (B. 1. iv. 1), who holds that miraculous stories must not <lb/>

            vexes you to see them in the company of the gods; and <lb/>
            especially whenever the one is commended for her beauty, <lb/>
            and the other performs on his cithara, to the admiration <lb/>
            of all in the banqueting-hall.</p>
          <p>Hera. I could not help laughing, Leto—he an object of <lb/>
            admiration, whom, if the Muses had chosen to give a just <lb/>
            decision, Marsyas would have flayed, as himself the con­ <lb/>
            queror in the musical contest.1 But, as it was, the poor <lb/>
            man was overreached, and perished by an unjust doom. <lb/>
            And, as for your beautiful virgin, she is so beautiful, that, <lb/>
            when she found she had been seen by Actæon, from fear <lb/>
            the youth might proclaim her ugliness, she set on him his <lb/>
            own dogs.2 I don't say all I might, for I omit to dwell on <lb/>
            the fact, that, if she were really a virgin,3 she could not <lb/>
            even assist ladies in the straw.</p>
          <p>Leto. You bear yourself superciliously, Hera, because <lb/>
            you share the bed and throne of Zeus; and for that reason, <lb/>
            you utter your insults without fear. But, however, I shall <lb/>

          <p>Apollo. How ? For I fancy you are going to tell met <lb/>
            something pleasant!</p>
          <p>Hermes. For a long time I imagine he had been aware of <lb/>
            this amour, and was hunting them down ; and when he had <lb/>
            enveloped their bed with invisible fetters,1 he went back to <lb/>
            his forge and worked away as usual. Then Ares enters <lb/>
            unobserved, as he supposed; but Helios looks down upon <lb/>
            them and sees them, and tells Hephæstus. And when they <lb/>
            had got upon the bed, and were in each other's arms, and <lb/>
            were involved within the meshes, the fetters completely <lb/>
            entangle them, and Hephæstus suddenly comes upon them. <lb/>
            She, you may be sure, had no means-for in fact she was <lb/>
            entirely naked-of veiling her shame; while Ares at <lb/>
            first kept making efforts to escape, and hoped to break the <lb/>
            bonds ; but afterwards, perceiving himself to be inextricably <lb/>
            caught,2 he began to act the suppliant.</p>

          <p>Athena. And pray, why is she so inquisitive about that ?</p>
          <p>Hermes. I don't know. But she says it occurred to her <lb/>
            quite casually, and she had no purpose in asking.</p>
          <p>Athena. Well, is he unmarried ?</p>
          <p>Hermes. I think not.</p>
          <p>Athena. What then ? Has he a desire for the military <lb/>
            life, and is he at all ambitious for glory, or is he altogether <lb/>
            devoted to his herds ?</p>
          <p>Hermes. The exact truth I am unable to say: but one <lb/>
            must suppose that a young fellow like him would be eager <lb/>
            to acquire fame in these things, and would like to be first <lb/>
            in fighting.</p>
          <p>Aphrodite (pouting). Do you see ? I don't find fault, nor <lb/>
            charge you with talking to her on the sly—for such sort of <lb/>
            querulousness is peculiar to people not over much pleased <lb/>
            with themselves : it's not Aphrodite's way.</p>
          <p>Hermes. Indeed she asked me almost exactly the same <lb/>
            question as she did you: so don't be in a pet, and don't <lb/>
            imagine you are worse treated, if I answered her somewhat <lb/>
            frankly and simply. But while we are talking, we have <lb/>
            already advanced far on our road, and taken leave of the <lb/>
            stars,2 and, in fact, are almost opposite Phrygia. And now, <lb/>
            in fact, I see Ida and the whole of Gargarus distinctly, and, <lb/>
            if I am not deceived, Paris himself, your umpire.</p>
          <p>Hera. But where is he ? For he is not visible to my <lb/>

            made our own descent, it is high time for you, Aphrodite, <lb/>

          <p>Aphrodite. These sneers of yours, Hera, don't disturb me <lb/>
            over much.</p>
          <p>Hermes. Well, I will act as your guide and chaperon; <lb/>
            for I myself, in fact, passed some time on Ida when Zeus, <lb/>
            to be sure, was in love with the Phrygian boy ;2 and often <lb/>
            have I come here, when sent down to look after the child. <lb/>
            And when, at length, he was mounted on the eagle,3 I flew by <lb/>
            his side with him, and helped to support my handsome <lb/>
            charge : and, if I recollect aright, from this rock here he <lb/>
            snatched him up—for the boy happened to be piping to his <lb/>
            flock at the moment-and flying down himself, from be­ <lb/>
            hind,4 Zeus very lightly embraced him in his talons, and, <lb/>
            grasping his turban with his beak, bore the lad aloft in a <lb/>
            terrible state of alarm, as he was gazing on his ravisher <lb/>
            with neck bent backwards. Then, picking up his shep­ <lb/>

            me, for here is our umpire close at hand: so let us accost <lb/>
            him.—Good day to you, herdsman.</p>
          <p>Paris. The same to you, young man. But who are you, <lb/>
            and what is the purpose of your visit to us ? What ladies <lb/>
            are these you are conducting ? For such town belles <lb/>
            as they are, they are not fitted for roving over rough <lb/>
            mountains.</p>
          <p>Hermes. But they are not women, Paris ; but it is Hera, <lb/>
            and Athena, and Aphrodite you see; and I, I am the God <lb/>
            Hermes Zeus has sent with them. But why do you <lb/>
            tremble and turn so pale ? Don't be frightened, for there <lb/>
            is nothing to be afraid of. He only bids you to be the <lb/>
            judge of their beauty: "for since," says he, "you are a <lb/>
            handsome youth yourself, and clever in love-matters, I <lb/>
            entrust the judgment to you ; and when you have read the <lb/>
            inscription on the apple, you will know the prize of the <lb/>
            contest.”</p>
          <p>Paris. Come, let me see what it all means—“ LET THE <lb/>
            BEAUTIFUL ONE TAKE ME," it says. How, pray, Sir Hermes, <lb/>
            could I, a mere mortal myself, and a simple peasant, too, <lb/>
            be a judge of so preternaturally wonderful a spectacle, and <lb/>
            one too great for a poor herdsman to decide upon ? To <lb/>
            judge in matters of such importance is rather for delicately­ <lb/>
            nurtured persons and courtiers : but, for my part, whether <lb/>
            one she-goat be more beautiful than another she-goat, or <lb/>
            one heifer surpasses another heifer in beauty I could per­ <lb/>
            haps decide secundum artem. But these ladies are all <lb/>
            equally beautiful, and I don't know how a man could <lb/>
            wrench away his gaze and transfer it from the one to the <lb/>
            other; for it will not easily unfix itself, but where it first <lb/>
            rests, to that part it clings, and commends what's imme­ <lb/>
            diately before it. And even though it pass on to another <lb/>
            part, that too it sees to be beautiful, and lingers, and is <lb/>
            caught by the adjoining charms; and, in short, their <lb/>
            beauty has circumfused itself about me, and wholly taken <lb/>
            possession of me, and I am vexed that I, too, cannot, like <lb/>
            Argus, see with all my body. I think I should judge <lb/>
            fairly, if I give the apple to all: for, indeed, there is this <note type="footnote"> 1 As in other of his similar descriptions, Lucian probably had in mind <lb/>
            some well-known picture, or sculpture, of the scene. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="43"/>
            difficulty besides ; it happens that this lady is the sister and <lb/>
            wife of Zeus,1 and that these are his daughters. How, I <lb/>
            should like to know, is not the decision a hard one from <lb/>
            this point of view, too ?</p>
          <p>Hermes. I don't know about that: but it's not possible <lb/>
            to shirk the commands of Zeus, I know.</p>
          <p>Paris. This one thing, Hermes, persuade them to-that <lb/>
            the two defeated ladies be not angry with me, but. consider <lb/>
            the error to attach to my eyes alone.</p>
          <p>Hermes. (confers with the Goddesses, apart.) They pro­ <lb/>
            mise to comply with your request. And now it is high <lb/>
            time for you to proceed with your judgment.</p>
          <p>Paris. I will do my best endeavours, for how can one <lb/>
            help it ? But this first I wish to know-will it be quite <lb/>
            enough to view them as they are, or will it be necessary to <lb/>
            make them undress for an accurate examination ?</p>
          <p>Hermes. That must be your part as judge to decide. <lb/>
            Give your orders how and in what way you like.</p>
          <p>Paris. How I like, really ? I wish to see them un­ <lb/>
            dressed.2</p>
          <p>Hermes. Ho, you ladies there, off with your clothes.3 <lb/>
            (To Paris.) For your part make a thorough survey-as for <lb/>
            me, I avert my face at once.</p>
          <p>Hera. Very well said, Paris, and I will be the first to <lb/>
            undress, that you may perceive that I have not only <lb/>
            “ white arms," and that I am not proud of having " cow's- <lb/>
            eyes" 4 only, but that I am equally and proportionally <lb/>
            beautiful all over.</p>
          <p>Paris. Off with your clothes, too, ApHrodite. <note type="footnote"> 1 " Ast ego, quæ divom incedo regina, Iovisque <lb/>

            0 Zeus, worker of miracles! the glorious vision! the <lb/>
            beauty ! the delight! How superb is the Virgin-Goddess ! <lb/>
            And how right royally, and with what dignity does this God­ <lb/>
            dess [Hera] shine in all her splendour ! and how truly right <lb/>
            worthy of Zeus ! But how sweetly does this Goddess here <lb/>
            [Aphrodite] look; and what a kind of pretty, seducing smile <lb/>
            she has !—Well, now I have enough of this felicity—but, <lb/>
            if it is agreeable, I wish to have a look at each of them sepa­ <lb/>
            rately, in private ; as, at present, I am really in doubt, and <lb/>
            don't know on what part to fix my gaze, for my eyes are <lb/>
            distracted in every direction.</p>
          <p>Aphrodite. Let us do as he wishes.</p>
          <p>Paris. Withdraw then, you two, and do you, Hera, <lb/>
            remain.</p>
          <p>Hera. I will do so-And, after you have had a good look <lb/>
            at me, it will be time for you to consider other matters <lb/>
            besides-whether the gifts at my disposal, in return for your <lb/>
            vote, do not appear fair to you. For if, my dear Paris, you <lb/>
            award me the prize of beauty, you shall be lord of all Asia.1</p>
          <p>Paris. Our decision depends not on bribes. Now with­ <lb/>
            draw, please; for whatever seems proper will have to be­ <lb/>
            done hereafter. And, now, Athena, do you approach.</p>
          <p>Athena. Here I am at your service. And, in my turn, <lb/>
            Paris, if you award to me the prize of beauty, you shall <lb/>
            never come out of battle worsted, but always victorious ; <lb/>
            for I will make a warrior and a conqueror of you.</p>
          <p>Paris. I don't want war and fighting, Athena; for <lb/>
            peace, as you see, at present, prevails both in Phrygia and <lb/>
            in Lydia, and my father's kingdom is free from war. But <lb/>
            never mind, for you shall not be the worse for it, even <lb/>
            though we do not give judgment for bribes. Well, now <lb/>
            put on your clothes again, and replace the helmet on your <lb/>
            head, for I have seen enough. It is now time for Aphrodite <lb/>

          <p>Aphrodite. Here am I at your elbow, and examine care­ <lb/>
            fully each part of me, one by one, passing over nothing, <lb/>
            but dwelling upon every one of my charms; and, if you <lb/>
            will, my handsome youth, listen to this from me. I have <lb/>
            reason to ask Tou to do so; for I have long ago observed you <lb/>
            to be young and good-looking, of such sort, that I doubt if <lb/>
            all Phrygia supports another like you, and I congratulate <lb/>
            you on your good looks: but I blame you, that you do not <lb/>
            leave these lonely cliffs and these rocks, and go and live in <lb/>
            the city, instead of wasting your sweetness on the desert <lb/>
            air. For what enjoyment can such as you obtain from the <lb/>
            mountains ? And what satisfaction can your cows derive <lb/>
            from your handsome face ? You ought by this time to <lb/>
            have married-not, however, some hoydenish and rustic <lb/>
            girl, such as are the women of Ida, but some girl out of <lb/>
            Hellas, from Argos, or from Korinth, or a Spartan lady, <lb/>
            such as Helen, young and beautiful, and in no way inferior <lb/>
            to myself; and, what is, indeed, most to the point, of an <lb/>
            amorous disposition. For, I tell you, if she were but only <lb/>
            to see you, she would, I am sure, leave all and give herself <lb/>
            up soul and body to you, and would follow your fortunes <lb/>
            and live with you. But, surely, even you have heard <lb/>
            something of her fame.</p>
          <p>Paris. Not a word, Aphrodite, and I should now be glad <lb/>
            to hear from you a full account of her.</p>
          <p>Aphrodite. She is the daughter of Leda, the famous <lb/>
            beauty, to whom Zeus flew down in the shape of a swan.</p>
          <p>Paris. What is she like to look at ?</p>

            I have two handsome boys, Desire and Love:2 them I will <lb/>

          <p>Ares. Did you hear, Hermes, what threats Zeus uttered <lb/>
            against us, how arrogant and absurd ? " If I should have <lb/>
            a mind to it," says he, " I will let down a chain from <lb/>
            Heaven, and you shall hang on it and use all your force to <lb/>
            pull me down, but you will labour in vain; for you will <lb/>

            my part, would not deny that he is superior to and stronger <lb/>
            than any of us taken separately; but that he surpasses so <lb/>
            many of us together, so that we could not wear him out, <lb/>
            even though we brought to our aid Earth and Sea—that I <lb/>

          <p>Hermes. Fair speech,2 my dear Ares ; for it's not safe to <lb/>
            speak in this sort of way, for fear we reap some mischief <lb/>

          <p>Hermes. By heaven, rather, probably, of an intrigue of <lb/>
            goats: for how could you be mine, with your horns, and <lb/>
            such a snub nose, and shaggy beard, and cloven feet, and <lb/>
            goatish legs, and tail upon your rump ?</p>
          <p>Pan. Whatever sneers you aim at me, it is your own son <lb/>
            you render an object of reproach, my dear father, but <lb/>
            yourself still more, for begetting and making such offspring. <lb/>
            I am innocent of it all.</p>
          <p>Hermes. And whom do you call your mother ? Have I <lb/>
            perchance had an intrigue with a goat without knowing it ?</p>
          <p>Pan. You have not committed adultery with a goat: <lb/>
            but recollect yourself, if you have never offered violence to <lb/>
            a girl of gentle birth in Arcadia. Why do you bite your <lb/>
            thumb to find an answer, and remain in doubt so long ? I <lb/>
            allude to Penelope, the daughter of Ikarius.1</p>
          <p>Hermes. Then under what circumstances did she bring <lb/>
            you into the world, resembling a goat instead of myself ?</p>
          <p>Pan. I will give you her very own story. Well, when <lb/>
            she despatched me to Arcadia, “My child," said she, "I <lb/>
            am your mother, Penelope, of Sparta, and know you have <lb/>
            a God, Hermes, the son of Maia and Zeus, for your father. <lb/>
            And if you wear horns, and have the legs of a goat, let not <lb/>
            that circumstance distress you; for, when your father <lb/>
            visited me, he gave himself the form of a he-goat, to avoid <lb/>
            notice, and for that reason you have turned out very like <lb/>
            that animal.</p>
          <p>Hermes. In truth, I remember to have done something <lb/>
            of the kind. Shall I, however, who pride myself so greatly <lb/>
            on my good looks, and am still without a beard, have the <lb/>
            reputation of being your father, and incur ridicule at the <lb/>
            hands of all on account of my lovely offspring ?</p>
          <p>Pan. Yet I shall not disgrace you, father, for I am a <lb/>
            musician, and play the pipe with remarkable sweetness ; and <lb/>
            Bacchus can do nothing without me, but has made me his <lb/>

            And I rule over all Arcadia; and, but lately, having <lb/>

            you go to Athens, you will know how great is the name of <lb/>
            Pan there.</p>
          <p>Hermes. But tell me, have you already married, Pan ?— <lb/>
            for that, I believe, is what they call you.</p>
          <p>Pan. Certainly not, father; for I am of an amorous <lb/>
            turn, and could never be content to live with one wife.</p>
          <p>Hermes. Then, no doubt, you make love to your she­ <lb/>

          <p>Pan. You are indulging in sarcasm. I keep company <lb/>
            with Echo and with Pitys,3 and with all the Mænads of <lb/>

          <p>Hermes. Do you know, however, how you could gratify <lb/>
            me, my dear son, who ask a favour of you for the first time ?</p>
          <p>Pan. Lay your commands upon me, father, and let us <lb/>
            know them.</p>
          <p>Hermes. Come to me, then, and affectionately embrace <lb/>
            me: but see that you don't call me father, at least in the <lb/>

            ambiguous appearance—you could not plainly distinguish <lb/>
            whether he is a young man 1 or a virgin. As for the third, <lb/>
            he is masculine beyond the bounds of all decency—Priapus, <lb/>
            I mean.</p>
          <p>Dionysus. There is nothing to be surprised at, Apollo; <lb/>
            for Aphrodite is not the cause of it, but the different <lb/>
            fathers. Often, in fact, where the children are by the <lb/>
            same father, of the same mother, they are, like yourselves, <lb/>
            the one a male, the other a female.</p>
          <p>Apollo. Yes, but we are alike, and follow the same pur­ <lb/>
            suits-for we are archers, both of us.</p>
          <p>Dionysus. As far as the bow is concerned, your occupa­ <lb/>
            tion is the same, Apollo: but those other things are not <lb/>
            exactly similar-that Artemis murders strangers among <lb/>
            the Scythians, and you act the prophet, and set up for a <lb/>
            doctor.</p>
          <p>Apollo. Why, do you imagine that my sister is happy <lb/>
            with the Scythians, seeing she is quite prepared, if any <lb/>
            Greek should ever happen to touch at the Tauric peninsula, <lb/>
            to sail away with him, loathing her sacrificial butchery ? 2</p>
          <p>Dionysus. And she does well to do so. As for Priapus, <lb/>
            however-for I will tell you something highly ridiculous- <lb/>
            being lately at Lampsacus, I was travelling by the city, <note type="footnote"> ports, Hermes and Aphrodite; Priapus, Aphrodite and Dionysus. <lb/>
            Priapus, the personification of natural fertility, was, as regards his <lb/>
            character and worship, like so many other divinities in the Hellenic <lb/>
            theology, a strange amalgam of Eastern and Western fancy. He was <lb/>
            pre-eminent by his ugliness as well as obscenity. As frequently repre­ <lb/>
            sented in Art, Hermaphroditus was half male, half female. See <lb/>

          <p>Apollo. And you, what did you do thereupon ?</p>

          <p>Apollo. Well done ! that was acting in no unkind or <lb/>
            uncivil manner. He was to be excused, indeed, considering <lb/>
            his attempt was directed against so good-looking a person­ <lb/>
            age as yourself.</p>
          <p>Dionysus. For that same reason, my dear Apollo, he <lb/>
            might direct his attention to you, too ; for you are a good- <lb/>
            looking youth, and adorned with long flowing tresses, so <lb/>
            that Priapus might well attempt your virtue even in his <lb/>

            tears, and his mother Klymene with him, after mounting <lb/>
            him on the chariot I cautioned him how he must stand <lb/>
            firmly, and how far he should allow his horses to go into <lb/>
            the higher regions, and be borne aloft; then how far he <lb/>
            must direct them downwards again, and how he must have <lb/>
            complete control of the reins, and not surrender them to <lb/>
            the fieriness of his steeds. And I told him, too, how great <lb/>

            with us yesterday, and this is Polydeukes.</p>
          <p>Apollo. How do you make your distinction ? For they <lb/>
            are as like as two peas. <note type="footnote"> 1 Of the Heliadæ or Heliades, Phoebe, Phaethusa, and Lampetie, <lb/>
            whose tears were converted into amber by divine interposition, Ovid has <lb/>

            was, later, identified with the Padus (Pado). AEschylus, in his lost <lb/>

          <p>Hermes. Thus—because this one, Apollo, has upon his <lb/>
            face the traces of the wounds which he received from his <lb/>
            antagonists when boxing, and especially the wounds which <lb/>
            were inflicted on him by the Bebrycian Amykus, 1 when on <lb/>
            the voyage with Jason; while the other shows nothing of <lb/>
            the kind, but is untouched and unwounded in his face.</p>
          <p>Apollo. You have conferred an obligation upon me by <lb/>
            indicating the distinguishing marks, since in regard to <lb/>
            other parts, all are exactly alike-the half segment of an <lb/>
            egg and star above, on their heads, a javelin in the hand, <lb/>

            name of Polydeukes. But tell me this, too, why in the <lb/>
            world do they not both live with us, but by halves either <lb/>
            of them at one moment is a dead man, and at another a <lb/>
            divinity ?</p>
          <p>Hermes. They act so out of brotherly affection, For, since <lb/>
            one of the sons of Leda must have died, and the other <lb/>
            have been immortal alone, they of their own accord <lb/>
            divided for themselves immortality between them in this <lb/>
            way.</p>
          <p>Apollo. A not altogether wise division, Hermes, since <lb/>

          <p>Doris. A handsome lover, my dear Galateia, that Sicilian <lb/>
            shepherd they say is so madly in love with you!</p>
          <p>Galateia. Don't sneer, Doris, for he is Poseidon's son, <lb/>
            whatever he may be like.</p>
          <p>Doris. What then ? If he were even the son of Zeus <lb/>
            himself, and showed so savage and uncouth a figure; and, <lb/>
            most unsightly of all his uglinesses, possessed only one <lb/>
            eye, do you imagine his birth would at all avail him, in <lb/>
            comparison with his shape ?</p>
          <p>Galateia. Not even his uncouthness and his savageness <lb/>
            (as you call it) is without its charm-for it gives him a <lb/>
            manly air ; and his eye becomes his forehead, and sees not <lb/>
            less than if there were two.</p>
          <p>Doris. You seem, Galateia, to consider your Polyphemus <lb/>
            not as the courting, but as the courted, one, such are your <lb/>
            praises of him.</p>
          <p>Galateia. Courted, no, but I cannot endure that excessive <lb/>
            proclivity of yours to finding fault, and you others seem to. <lb/>
            me to do it from envy; because, when, some time ago, he <lb/>
            was tending his flocks, and had a glimpse of us from his <lb/>
            cliff, as we were sporting upon the shore, at the foot of <lb/>
            Ætna, where it extends between the mountain and the sea, <lb/>
            he did not even look at you others, whereas I appeared to. <note type="footnote"> 1 Cf. Theok. <foreign xml:lang="grc">Εἰδ</foreign>. xi. (where the Cyclops charges the Sea-Nymph with <lb/>

            him as the most beautiful of all of us, and so he kept his eye <lb/>
            upon me alone. It is this that vexes you, for it is a proof <lb/>
            that I am superior, and deserving to be loved; while you <lb/>
            other Nymphs have been neglected.</p>
          <p>Doris. If you appear beautiful to the eyes of a keeper of <lb/>
            sheep and to a fellow who wants an eye, do you suppose you <lb/>
            are an object of envy ? and, besides, what else had he to <lb/>
            commend in you than your white skin ? and that, I suppose, <lb/>
            because he is accustomed to cheese and milk : everything, <lb/>
            therefore, resembling those things he considers beautiful. 1 <lb/>
            For as to other charms, whenever you wish to discover <lb/>
            what you are really like, stoop from some rock, when the <lb/>
            sea is calm, over the water, and behold yourself to be <lb/>
            nothing else than an exceedingly white skin ; and that is <lb/>
            not commended unless, too, there is colour to set it off.</p>
          <p>Galateia. Yet I, so purely white as I am, nevertheless <lb/>
            have a lover, though it's only he; whereas there is not <lb/>
            one of you whom either shepherd, or sailor, or boatman <lb/>
            praises. And my Polyphemus, among other merits, is also <lb/>
            musical.</p>
          <p>Doris. Hold your tongue, Galateia; we heard his singing, <lb/>
            when but now he came serenading to you. So may <lb/>
            Aphrodite be2 my friend, one would have imagined an ass <lb/>
            was braying. And his very lyre-what a thing it was ! <lb/>
            The bare skull of a stag, and the horns served as the <lb/>
            handles,3 and he bridged them, and fitted in the strings, <lb/>
            without even twisting them round a peg, and then began <lb/>
            to perform some horribly unmusical and unmelodious <lb/>
            melody; himself roaring out one thing, and his lyre accom­ <lb/>
            panying him to something else, so that we could not even <lb/>
            restrain our laughter at that fine love ditty. Why, Echo <lb/>
            would not even return any reply to his bellowing, loquacious <note type="footnote"> 1 Polyphemus, in such preference, is not without high authority. <lb/>
            With the poets, indeed, extreme whiteness has been one of the principal <lb/>
            characteristics of feminine beauty. Spenser's Una is even " whiter than <lb/>

            was carrying in his arms, for a plaything, a bear's cub, <lb/>
            resembling himself in shagginess. Who, pray, would not <lb/>
            envy you, my Galateia, such a lover ?</p>
          <p>Galateia. Do you then, my dear Doris, show us your own <lb/>
            adorer, who is, doubtless, handsomer, and more of a <lb/>
            musician, and better skilled in performing on the cithara.</p>
          <p>Doris. Nay, I have no adorer, nor do I pride myself on <lb/>
            being admired. But as for your Cyclops, such as he is, <lb/>

            put out my eye, assaulting me when I was lulled to sleep.</p>
          <p>Poseidon. Who dared to do this, my poor Polyphemus ? <lb/>
            Cyclops. In the first instance, he called himself Outis;2 <lb/>
            but, when he had got clear away, and was out of reach of <lb/>
            my arrow, he said that his name was Odysseus.</p>
          <p>Poseidon. I know whom you speak of—him of Ithaka, <lb/>
            and he was on his return-voyage from Ilium. But how <lb/>
            did he do it, for he is, by no means, a man of too much <lb/>
            courage ?</p>
          <p>Cyclops. Returning from my accustomed tending of my <lb/>
            flocks, I caught a number of fellows in my cave, evidently <lb/>
            having designs on my herds : for, when I placed the stone <lb/>
            block against the door-the rock is of huge size-and had <lb/>
            lighted the fire by igniting the tree which I brought from <note type="footnote"> 1 Cf. <foreign xml:lang="grc">Ὀδ</foreign>. ix.; Ov. Metam. xiii. 7; xiv. 4; Euripides, <foreign xml:lang="grc">Κύκλωψ</foreign>; Æn. <lb/>

            the mountain, evidently they appeared to be trying to conceal <lb/>
            themselves. Well, when I had got hold of some of them, <lb/>
            I devoured them for a pack of thieves, as was reasonable. <lb/>
            Hereupon that most villainous rascal, whether he was Outis <lb/>
            or Odysseus, pours out a sort of drug and gives me to <lb/>
            drink-sweet, indeed, and of delicious smell, but most <lb/>
            insidious, and which caused great disorder in my head: <lb/>
            for immediately upon my drinking everything seemed to <lb/>
            me to be in a whirl, and the cave itself was turned upside <lb/>
            down, and I was no longer at all in my senses ; and, at last, <lb/>
            I was dragged down into sleep. Then sharpening the bar, <lb/>
            and igniting it besides, he blinded me as I slept, and from <lb/>
            that time, I am a blind man, at your service, Poseidon.</p>
          <p>Poseidon. How soundly you slept, my son, that you did <lb/>
            not jump up while you were being blinded ! But as for <lb/>
            this Odysseus, then, how did he escape ? For he could not <lb/>
            —I am well assured that he could not-move away the <lb/>
            rock from the door.</p>
          <p>Cyclops. Yes, but it was I who removed it, that I might <lb/>
            the better catch him as he was going out; and, sitting <lb/>
            down close to the door, I groped for him with extended <lb/>
            hands, letting only ray sheep pass out. to pasture, after <lb/>
            having given instructions to the ram what he was to do in <lb/>
            my place.</p>
          <p>Poseidon. I understand, they slipped away under them <lb/>
            unnoticed. But you ought to have shouted, and called the <lb/>
            rest of the Cyclopes to your aid against him.</p>
          <p>Cyclops. I did summon them, father, and they came. <lb/>
            But when they asked the sneaking rascal's name, and I <lb/>
            said it was Outis, thinking I was in a mad fit, they took <lb/>
            themselves off at once. Thus the cursed fellow tricked me <lb/>
            with his name; and what especially vexes me is, that <lb/>
            actually throwing my misfortune in my teeth, " Not even," <lb/>
            says he, " will your father Poseidon cure you." 1 <note type="footnote"> 1 See <foreign xml:lang="grc">Ὀδ</foreign>. ix. 525, and the anguished cry for vengeance of the <lb/>

            the only one that falls into the sea without mingling with <lb/>
            the salt water, as is the custom of other streams, nor do <lb/>
            you rest from pouring yourself along; but, in your passage <lb/>
            through the sea, contracting and keeping sweet your <lb/>
            waters, still unmixed and pure, you hasten I know not <lb/>
            where, diving into the depths, like the sea-gulls and <lb/>

          <p>Alpheius. Something of a love-affair, Poseidon, so don't <lb/>

          <p>Poseidon. And she—where in the world does she flow ?</p>

            this Arethusa. On the contrary, she is beautifully clear <lb/>
            and transparent, and gushes out in a pure stream, and the <note type="footnote"> 1 The Alpheius, the modern Rufia, rising in the mountains of Arcadia, <lb/>

            itself into the Ionian Sea, not far from Olympia, in Elis. According to <lb/>

            your Arethusa, seeing that you yourself are Arcadian, and <lb/>

          <p>Poseidon. You are right. Away to your beloved, and <lb/>

          <p>Galene. I was not at the banquet with you, for Poseidon <lb/>
            ordered me, Panope, to keep the sea unagitated mean­ <lb/>

            guest ?</p>
          <p>Panope. Thetis and Peleus had already gone off to their <lb/>
            bridal chamber, escorted by Amphitrite and Poseidon. <lb/>
            But Eris, meanwhile, unobserved by any-and she could <lb/>
            easily be so, while some were drinking, others making a <lb/>
            clatter, or giving all their attention to Apollo playing on <lb/>
            the cithara, or to the Muses as they sang-threw into the <lb/>
            midst of the banqueting-hall a certain very beautiful <lb/>
            apple, all of gold, 1 Galene. And it was inscribed : " Let <lb/>

            hood of the sea-coast of Æthiopia here, while now flying near <lb/>
            to the earth, he sees Andromeda lying exposed upon a certain <lb/>

            ye gods ! with her tresses let down, half naked much below <lb/>
            the breasts.2 In the first place, pitying her fate, he began <lb/>

            but, insensibly captured by passion-for the girl had to be <lb/>

          <p>Zephyrus. Never did I see a more magnificent Proces­ <lb/>
            sion on the sea, since I was born, and began to blow. But <lb/>
            you—did you not see it, Notus ?</p>
          <p>Notus. What is this Procession you talk of, Zephyrus, <lb/>
            or who were the Processionists ?</p>
          <p>Zephyrits. You have missed a most delicious spectacle, <lb/>
            the like of which you may never see again.</p>
          <p>Notus. Yes, for I was employed in the neighbourhood of <lb/>
            the Red Sea, and, indeed, I blow over part of India, as <lb/>
            much of the country as stretches along the sea-coast. <lb/>
            I know, therefore, nothing of what you speak of.</p>
          <p>Zephyrus. But you know Agenor of Sidon ?</p>
          <p>Notus. Yes, the father of Europa. 1 What then ?</p>
          <p>Zephyrus. It is about herself I will relate to you a story.</p>
          <p>Notus. It is not, is it, that Zeus has been for a long time <lb/>
            the girl's lover ? For that I knew quite a long while ago.</p>
          <p>Zephyrus. You are, then, aware of the amour. But listen <lb/>
            now to the sequel. Europa had gone down to the shore <lb/>
            in sportive mood, taking with her companions of her own <note type="footnote"> 1 See Ov. Metam. ii. 14, in. 1, and the charming Idyll of Moschus, <lb/>

            the enmity between them, recounts that of Europa, whom he alleges to <lb/>

            that a girl would mount a fierce bull; and Zeus, if he wished to bring <lb/>
            Europa to Krete, would have found for her a pleasanter way of travel­ <lb/>

            age. And Zeus, making himself like a bull, began to <lb/>
            sport with them, seeming a very handsome creature, for he <lb/>
            was perfectly white, and had beautifully crumpled horns, <lb/>
            and was tame and quiet in look. He began, then, as he was, <lb/>
            to frolic about upon the shore, and to bellow most sweetly; <lb/>
            so that Europa ventured even to mount him. And, as soon <lb/>
            as this was done, Zeus started off with her at a running pace <lb/>
            towards the sea ; and, plunging in, began to swim. But <lb/>
            she, very much terrified at the occurrence, with her left <lb/>
            hand kept clinging to his horn, that she might not slip off, <lb/>
            while with the other she held together her long flowing <lb/>
            dress, 1 blown about by the wind.</p>
          <p>Notus. That was a charming spectacle, Zephyrus, you <lb/>
            witnessed, and an amorous—Zeus swimming, carrying <lb/>
            his beloved.</p>
          <p>Zephyrus. Yet what followed was far more delightful, <lb/>
            Notus. For the sea from that moment was without a <lb/>
            ripple, and, attracting a perfect calm, showed itself smooth <lb/>
            and unruffled. We, however, keeping quiet, followed, <lb/>
            being no more than mere spectators of what was hap­ <lb/>
            pening : and the Loves, hovering a little above the sea, <lb/>
            so as at times to graze the water with the tips of their <lb/>
            feet, with lighted torches, sang together the hymeneal <lb/>
            song: while the Nereids, emerging from the sea, rode by <lb/>
            their side upon dolphins, clapping their hands, most of them <lb/>
            half-naked.2 Then, too, the whole tribe of Tritons, and <lb/>
            whatever else of the sea-dwellers is not terrible to the <lb/>
            sight-all led their dances round the girl. Poseidon, <lb/>
            indeed, mounting upon his chariot, and with Amphitrite <lb/>
            riding at his side, led the way with hilarity, clearing the <lb/>
            way for his swimming brother. To crown all, two Tritons <lb/>
            were bearing Aphrodite, who reclined upon a shell, and <note type="footnote"> 1 The <foreign xml:lang="grc">πέπλοϚ</foreign> was a full, flowing dress worn by Greek ladies. Cf. <lb/>

              when he had set foot on the island, the bull was no longer <lb/>
              to be seen. Then Zeus, taking her by the hand, conducted <lb/>
              Europa to the cave of Dikte, blushing and with eyes cast <lb/>
              down: for now she knew to what she was being led. And <lb/>

          <p>Menippus. So then, you two, Trophonius and Amphi­ <lb/>
            lochus, dead men though you are, for some reason or other <lb/>
            have been thought worthy of temples, and have the repu­ <lb/>

            supposed you to be divine.</p>
          <p>Amphilochus. Why, pray, are we to blame, if they, in <lb/>
            their folly, will have such opinions about dead people ?</p>
          <p>Menippus. But they would not be holding such opinions, <lb/>
            unless, while you were living, you had indulged in such <lb/>
            juggling tricks, as though you foreknew the future, <lb/>
            and were able to foretell it to those who inquired of <lb/>
            you.</p>
          <p>Trophonius. Menippus, Amphilochus himself must know <lb/>
            what answer he is to give respecting himself : but I, for <lb/>
            my part, am a hero, and deliver prophecies, whenever any <lb/>
            one comes down to visit me. But you appear never to <note type="footnote"> 1 Amphilochus, with his equally prophetic father, enjoyed great re­ <lb/>
            putation for oracular power. While on earth, they had taken part in <lb/>
            the celebrated War of the Epigoni (or " Descendants " of the Seven <lb/>
            against Thebes) upon the city of Œdipus. Amphilochus, the murderer <lb/>
            of his mother, had shrines at Athens, at Oropus on the confines of <lb/>
            Attica and Bœotia, and at Mallus in Cilicia. The Oracle of Amphi­ <lb/>
            araus was situated near Thebes, at the spot where he had been <lb/>
            swallowed up with his chariot, in his flight from the battle before that <lb/>
            city. For the still more renowned Oracle and Cavern of Trophonius <lb/>
            (who while in the flesh had enjoyed the reputation of an expert thief) <lb/>
            at Lebadeia in Boeotia, see Aristoph. <foreign xml:lang="grc">Νεφ</foreign>. 507 ; Diod. B. I. xv.; Philost. <lb/>

            Alexis) had not neglected so promising a subject. Pausanias, ix. 39. <lb/>
            Pausanias gives a rather particular account of the Cavern and its pre­ <lb/>
            ternatural terrors, of which he had himself been witness. Plutarch is <lb/>
            said to have left a treatise on the subject, which, very unhappily, has <lb/>

            refuse credence to these things.</p>
          <p>Menippus. What do you say? Unless I had gone to <lb/>
            Lebadeia, and dressed myself ridiculously in those fine <lb/>
            linen robes, and carried a barley-cake in my hands, and had <lb/>
            crawled through the mouth, which is low enough in the <lb/>
            roof, into the Cavern, I could not know that you are a dead <lb/>
            man, as we are, superior only by your juggling faculty ? <lb/>
            But, in the name of the prophetic art, what, pray, is a <lb/>
            " hero " ? for I don't know.</p>
          <p>Trophonius. A sort of compound of man and God.</p>
          <p>Menippus. Which (as you say) is neither man nor god, <lb/>
            but both together ? Where, then, has that half of you, <lb/>
            the divine part, now gone off to ?</p>
          <p>Trophonius. It is delivering oracles in Boeotia, Menippus.</p>
          <p>Menippus. I don't know, my friend Trophonius, what <lb/>
            you are talking about, indeed. That, however, you are <lb/>

          <p>Charon. A high price !</p>
          <p>Hermes. By Pluto, I purchased them at the full sum of <lb/>
            the five pieces, and a leathern thong for the oar for two <lb/>
            oboli.</p>
          <p>Charon. Set down five drachmas and two oboli.</p>

            oboli I paid down for that.</p>

          <p>Hermes. And bees'-wax to fill up the chinks in our little <lb/>
            craft, and nails, too, and a small rope, of which you made <lb/>
            the brace-two drachmae in all.</p>
          <p>Charon. And you made a good bargain there.</p>
          <p>Hermes. That is the whole sum, unless something else <lb/>
            has altogether escaped me in the reckoning. And when, <lb/>
            then, do you say that you will repay me this ?</p>
          <p>Charon. Just now, my dear Hermes, it is quite impos­ <lb/>
            sible. But if some pestilence or war should send us down <lb/>
            some shoals of men, it will then be in my power to make <lb/>
            profits by cooking the accounts of the fares.2</p>

            something from it ?</p>
          <p>Charon. There is nothing for you, otherwise, Hermes. <lb/>
            Just now, as you see, few come to us : for peace prevails.3</p>
          <p>Hermes. Better so, even though payment of your debt <lb/>

          <p>Pluto. You know that old man, I mean the very aged <lb/>

            but fifty thousand legacy-hunters ?</p>
          <p>Hermes. Yes, you speak of the Sikyonian. What then ?</p>
          <p>Pluto. Well, let him live on, Hermes; to the ninety <lb/>
            years he has already reached dealing out so many again, <lb/>
            and, if, at least, it were possible, even yet more. But as for <lb/>
            those fawning flatterers of his, the young Charinus, and <lb/>
            Damon, and the rest, drag them all down here, one after the <lb/>

          <p>Hermes. Such a proceeding would appear strange.</p>
          <p>Pluto. Not at all, but exceedingly just. For what wrong <lb/>
            have they suffered that they pray for his death, or, although <lb/>
            no way related, why ,do they lay claim to his money ? But <lb/>
            what of all things is most abominable is, that though they <lb/>
            entertain such wishes, they yet court and fawn upon him <note type="footnote"> 1 In this and the two Dialogues following, Lucian satirizes a highly- <lb/>

            evident to all; but, all the same, they engage to offer <lb/>

            by death, and let the others go off before him, while vainly <lb/>

          <p>Hermes. They will suffer a ridiculous fate, rascals that <lb/>

            them up with vain hopes exceedingly; and, in a word, <lb/>
            while always appearing like a corpse, he has far more <lb/>
            strength than the young men. They, however, already have <lb/>

          <p>Terpsion. Is this just, Pluto, that I have died at the age <lb/>
            of thirty years, while the old Thukritus, above his full tale <lb/>
            of ninety, lives on ?</p>
          <p>Pluto. Very just, certainly, Terpsion, since he does not <lb/>
            pass his life praying for the death of any of his friends, <lb/>
            while you the whole time were plotting against him, and <lb/>
            expecting his legacy.</p>
          <p>Terpsion. Why, was it not fitting, old as he was, and no <lb/>
            longer capable of using his wealth, he had departed from <lb/>
            life and made way for the young ?</p>
          <p>Pluto. You lay down new and strange laws, Terpsion­ <lb/>
            that a man, who is no longer able to enjoy his money, <lb/>
            should die ! But Fate and Nature have ordered it differ­ <lb/>
            ently.'</p>
          <p>Terpsion. Then I blame them for that arrangement of <lb/>
            theirs ; for the business should have proceeded in some sort <lb/>
            of order-the older should go first, and after him the next in <lb/>
            age-and by no means have been reversed; nor should the <lb/>
            man laden with years, with only three teeth still left in his <lb/>
            head, seeing with difficulty, crouching and leaning upon the <lb/>
            shoulders of four domestics, his nose stuffed with phlegm <lb/>
            and his eyes with rheum, with no further perception of <lb/>
            anything pleasing, a sort of living tomb, derided by the <note type="footnote"> 1 Compare the scene in the opening of the Alkestis of Euripides, where <lb/>

            when each particular old gentleman will certainly be on <lb/>
            the point of going off, so that they would not fawn upon <lb/>
            any of them to no purpose. Now, however, is the proverb <lb/>
            verified, " the wagon drags the ox.” 2</p>
          <p>Pluto. These things, Terpsion, are much more reason­ <lb/>
            able than they seem to you to be. And you—what pos­ <lb/>
            sesses you that you gape with open mouth after other <lb/>
            people's possessions, and thrust and force yourselves upon <lb/>
            childless old fellows ? Thus it is you incur ridicule, when <lb/>
            you are laid under ground before them; and the matter <lb/>
            affords the greatest delight to most people, for, in pro­ <lb/>
            portion as you pray for their deaths is it a pleasure to all <lb/>
            that you predecease them. Why, this is some new and <lb/>
            strange art you have devised-to make love to old men and <lb/>
            old women, most especially if they have no children ; while <lb/>
            those who are blessed with progeny have no lovers, as far <lb/>
            as you are concerned. However, already many of the objects <lb/>
            of your affection, understanding the rascality of your attach­ <lb/>
            ment, if they have children, pretend to hate them, so that <lb/>
            they too may possess lovers ; accordingly, they who long <lb/>
            danced attendance, like a number of satellites, are excluded <lb/>
            in the wills ; while the child and Nature, as is just, possess <lb/>
            everything, and these gentlemen grind their teeth at having <lb/>
            been finely cheated.</p>

            a number of things, that my rivals in affection might not <lb/>

            by your death ? For my part, you know that I, who was <lb/>
            Deinias's parasite, was choked by gorging inordinately : <lb/>
            for you were present at my death.</p>
          <p>Kallidemides. I was so, Zenophantes. But my fate was <lb/>
            a strange and unusual sort of one. You knew surely <lb/>
            something of Ptceodorus, the old gentleman ?</p>
          <p>Zenophantes. The childless millionaire, with whom I <lb/>
            knew you as chiefly familiar ?</p>
          <p>Kallidemides. That's the very man I was always courting, <lb/>
            who promised that he would speedily depart this life for <lb/>
            my special benefit. When, however, the business was being <lb/>
            protracted to an unconscionable length, and the old fellow <lb/>
            was extending his life beyond the age of Tithonus 1 himself, <lb/>
            I devised an expeditious sort of road to the inheritance. <lb/>
            Purchasing a poison, I induced his butler, as soon as ever <lb/>
            Ptœodorus asked to drink-and he drinks pretty hard-to <lb/>
            put it in his cup and have it ready to give to him ; and, if <lb/>
            he would do so, I pledged myself by oath to give him his <lb/>
            freedom.</p>
          <p>Zenophantes. What happened then ? For you seem to <lb/>
            be going to tell some very strange story.</p>
          <p>Kallidemides. Well, when we had come from the bath, <lb/>
            the lad with the two cups all ready, the one having the <lb/>
            poison for Ptœodorus, and the other for me—by some <lb/>
            blunder gave me the poison, and Ptœodorus the unpoisoned <lb/>
            goblet. Accordingly he drank his harmlessly, while in a <lb/>
            moment I lay an outstretched corpse, substituted in his <lb/>
            place.- Why do you laugh at this, Zenophantes ? Surely it <lb/>
            does not beseem you to mock at a gentleman and a friend.</p>
          <p>Zenophantes (laughing immoderately). Why, my friend <lb/>
            Kallidemides, you experienced a comical sort of fate. But <lb/>
            the old gentleman, what did he at this?</p>
          <p>Kallidemides. At first he was somewhat disturbed at the <note type="footnote"> 1 A Greek proverb analogous to our “ as old as Methuselah,” with <lb/>

            butler had served me.</p>

            find pleasure in life.</p>
          <p>Polystratus. In the first place, I enjoyed universal power; <lb/>
            besides, I had many and handsome slave-boys, and very <lb/>
            elegant women, and unguents, and fragrant wine, and a more <lb/>

          <p>Simylus. Strange news to me this, for I used to think <lb/>
            you exceedingly parcimonious.</p>
          <p>Polystratus. Yes, but, my good friend, the good things <lb/>
            literally used to flow in upon me from the hands of others; <lb/>
            and from early morning they would come straight to my <lb/>
            doors in shoals, and afterwards all sorts of presents were <lb/>
            brought to me from every corner of the earth, the most <lb/>
            beautiful conceivable.</p>
          <p>Simylus. Did you become an autocrat after may death, <lb/>
            Polystratus ?</p>
          <p>Polystratus. No, but I had ten thousand lovers.</p>
          <p>Simylus (holding his sides). I couldn't help laughing. <lb/>
            You lovers, at your age, with four teeth in your head !</p>
          <p>Polystratus. Yes, by heavens ! the noblest in the State. <lb/>
            Even old as I was, and without a hair on my head, as you <lb/>
            see, and blear-eyed into the bargain, and my nose stuffed <lb/>
            with phlegm, they were beyond measure delighted to fawn <lb/>
            upon me; and happy was he among them, whomsoever I <lb/>
            merely looked at even.</p>
          <p>Simylus. You did not, too, did you, like the Phaon 2 of <lb/>
            the story, carry some Aphrodite over in your boat from <lb/>
            Chios; and then she did not grant to your prayers to bo <lb/>
            young and handsome over again, and a suitable object of <lb/>
            love ?</p>
          <p>Polystratus. No; but I was the object of their eager desire, <lb/>
            just such as I am.</p>
          <p>Simylus. You speak in riddles.</p>
          <p>Polystratus. And yet this affection I speak of, with its <note type="footnote"> 1 Proverbial expression for “sumptuous gluttonies” (in Milton’s <lb/>

            extravagant display in regard to childless and wealthy old <lb/>
            gentlemen, is, surely, plain enough in its origin.</p>
          <p>Simylus. Now I understand all about your charming <lb/>
            face, admirable Sir ! that it was from the golden Aphrodite.'</p>
          <p>Polystratus. However, my dear Simylus, I obtained not <lb/>
            a few enjoyments from my lovers, and was all but wor­ <lb/>
            shipped by them, and I often behaved insolently to them, <lb/>
            and closed my doors against some of them at times ; but they <lb/>
            would contend with eager emulation, and surpass one the <lb/>
            other in their lavish expense and delicate attentions to me.</p>
          <p>Simylus. And, at last, pray, how did you devise in regard <lb/>
            to your possessions ?</p>
          <p>Polystratus. In public I was accustomed to declare that <lb/>
            I had left each one of them my heir; and he believed it <lb/>
            and equipped himself with more wheedling flattery than <lb/>
            ever; but, all the time, I held in my possession the other <lb/>
            my real will, and left it behind me, with an injunction to <lb/>
            one and all of them to go to the devil.</p>
          <p>Simylus. And whom did your last will contain as your <lb/>
            heir ? Some one of your own family, I presume ?</p>
          <p>Polystratus. By heaven, no, but a certain recently-pur­ <lb/>
            chased handsome boy, a Phrygian.</p>
          <p>Simylus. About how old, friend Polystratus ?</p>
          <p>Polystratus. Somewhere about the age of twenty.</p>
          <p>Simylus. Now I understand what favours he conferred <lb/>
            upon you.</p>
          <p>Polystratus. But, however, he was much more worthy to <lb/>
            be my heir than they, even though he was a foreigner and <lb/>
            a plague ; whom even the great people themselves are <lb/>
            already courting. He, then, was my heir, and now he is <lb/>
            received among the nobles of the land (shaved though his <lb/>
            chin was,2 and though he did not know a word of Greek), <lb/>

          <p>Charon. Just hear a moment how matters stand with us. <lb/>
            Our little craft, as you observe, is a small one, and it is <lb/>
            somewhat rotten, and leaks in most parts ; and, were it to <lb/>
            incline to either side, it would completely overturn and go <lb/>
            to the bottom ; and yet you come crowding together at <lb/>
            the same time, each of you carrying a lot of luggage. If, <lb/>
            then, you were to embark with all this, I am afraid that <lb/>
            you may have reason to repent later, and especially as many <lb/>
            of you as don't know how to swim.</p>
          <p>Dead Men. What shall we do, then, to secure a safe <lb/>
            passage ?</p>
          <p>Charon. I will tell you. You must embark stripped of <lb/>
            everything, and leave all these superfluous things upon <lb/>
            the shore : for scarcely even so will the ferry-boat receive <lb/>
            you.—But it will be your care, Hermes, from this moment, <lb/>
            to receive none of them who should not come in light <lb/>
            marching order, and throw away, as I said, his furniture <lb/>

            your lake; and as for my tattered cloak, I have obligingly <lb/>

            most skilful in war, and was deemed fit for the highest <lb/>

            ruins so many cities, and subjected to my power the whole <lb/>
            plain of Italy, and advanced as far as the suburbs of its <lb/>
            Capital city, and slew such numbers on one day that I <lb/>
            measured off their rings by bushels,4 and bridged their <lb/>
            rivers with the dead. And all this I accomplished with­ <lb/>

            having terrorized all Hellas, and having been elected by <lb/>
            them to the command-in-chief, I did not think fit to confine <lb/>
            my cares to my Macedonian dominions, and to be content <lb/>
            to rule over what my father had left behind him ; but, <lb/>
            extending my thoughts to the whole Earth, and thinking <lb/>
            it intolerable if I should not become master of the world, <lb/>
            with a few soldiers I invaded Asia ; and at the Granikus I <lb/>
            gained a great battle ; and seizing upon Lydia, Ionia, and <lb/>
            Phrygia, and, in fine, conquering in succession everything <lb/>
            in my way, I advanced to Issus, where Dareius awaited me <lb/>
            with an army of many myriads. From that time, Minos, <lb/>
            you know how many dead I sent below to you on one day; <lb/>
            at all events, the Ferryman says that his boat did not <lb/>
            suffice, at that time, for them, but that the majority of them <lb/>
            constructed rafts for themselves, and so made the passage. <lb/>
            And this I accomplished by being foremost in danger <lb/>
            myself, and deeming it glorious to get myself wounded. <lb/>
            Not to recount to you my exploits at Tyre, or at Arbela, <lb/>
            not only all that, but I advanced as far as the Indians, and <lb/>
            made for myself the Ocean the boundary of my empire ; <lb/>
            and I captured their elephants, and worsted Porus. And <lb/>
            as for the Scythians, not a people to be despised with <lb/>
            impunity, I crossed the Don and conquered them in a <lb/>
            great cavalry battle. And I conferred benefits on my <lb/>
            friends, and avenged myself on my enemies; and, if I <lb/>
            appeared to men to be indeed divine, they are to be excused, <lb/>
            in consideration of the greatness of my actions, for believing <lb/>
            something of the kind about me. Finally, I died while <lb/>
            yet a king, whereas this fellow died in exile at the court <lb/>
            of Prusias of Bithynia, as it was right a man of the greatest <lb/>
            villainy and cruelty should. For how he conquered the <lb/>
            Italians I omit to say-that he did not do it by force, but <lb/>
            by corruption, and not keeping faith,1 and by stratagems ; <lb/>
            nothing according to the usages of war or above-board. <lb/>
            And, as for his reproaching me with luxury, I think he has <lb/>
            forgotten entirely what he was accustomed to do in Capua, <lb/>
            living with ladies of the demi-monde, and, admirable General, <lb/>
            wasting in pleasures the opportunities of war. I, on the <note type="footnote"> 1 “ Punica fides " became proverbial with the Romans, but Romana <lb/>

            small matter, and made my first attacks, rather, on the <lb/>
            side of the East, what great achievement could I have <lb/>
            done-seizing, without shedding a drop of blood, upon <lb/>
            Italy, and subjecting to my power Libya and the continent <lb/>
            as far as Grades ? No; those parts of the world seemed to <lb/>
            me not worth fighting for, being already cowed and <lb/>
            acknowledging a master. I have said. Now do you, <lb/>

            enough to decide by.</p>
          <p>Scipio. Not before you have heard me, too.</p>
          <p>Minos. Why, who are you, my fine Sir ? or as what <lb/>
            countryman will you speak ?</p>
          <p>Scipio. An Italian; 1 Scipio, the general who razed <lb/>
            Carthage, and conquered the Libyans in great battles.</p>
          <p>Minos. What, pray, would you say ?</p>
          <p>Scipio. That I am inferior, indeed, to Alexander, but <lb/>
            superior to Hannibal—I who vanquished and pursued him, <lb/>
            and forced him to a disgraceful flight. How, then, is this <lb/>
            fellow not ashamed to contend in rivalry with Alexander, <lb/>
            with whom not even I, Scipio, his conqueror, claim to put <lb/>
            myself in comparison ?</p>
          <p>Minos. By my faith, you speak the words of reason, <lb/>
            Scipio; so let Alexander be judged to be first, next to him <lb/>
            come you; then, by your leave, follows Hannibal third; <lb/>
            for neither is he to be despised with impunity.2 <note type="footnote"> 1 ’<foreign xml:lang="grc">Ιταλιώτης</foreign>. Properly a Greek resident in Italy; but sometimes, as <lb/>

            the Blessed. On this occasion Rhadamanthys, who is the judge, assigns <lb/>
            the first place, also, to the conqueror of Dareius, on a throne by the <lb/>
            side of the founder of the Persian monarchy. Scipio does not figure in <lb/>
            this scene; and it is a curious fact that no Roman is admitted into <lb/>
            Lucian's Elysium. By Livy (xxxv. 14) Hannibal is represented as <lb/>
            much more modest than he appears in this Dialogue; for, in reply <lb/>
            to a question of Scipio, he pronounces Alexander to be the first of <lb/>
            military commanders, Pyrrhus, King of Epeirus, second, and himself <lb/>
            third; although, if he had been so fortunate as to conquer his ques­ <lb/>

            to give the precedence to himself. Cf. Appian, ‛<foreign xml:lang="grc">Ιστ. Ρωμ</foreign>. xi. In </note></p><pb n="120"/>

          <p>Alexander. You see for yourself it is so, Diogenes; but <lb/>

          <p>Diogenes. Then Ammon lied in saying that you were his <lb/>

          <p>Alexander. Philip's undoubtedly; for had I been <lb/>

          <p>Diogenes. Yet similar 2 stories used to be told of Olympias <lb/>

            begged of me, what sort of letters he sent me, and how he <lb/>

            will you cease to be troubled at " the goods " of Aristotle. <lb/>
            -Why, really, I see the Kleitus you know about, and <lb/>
            Kallisthenes, and many others rushing towards you, as <lb/>
            though they would tear you in pieces, and wreak their <lb/>

            bad not died.</p>
          <p>Alexander. Nor was I myself ignorant, father, that I am <lb/>
            the son of Philip and grandson of Amyntas; but I accepted <lb/>
            the oracle as supposing it to be of service to the success of <lb/>
            my undertakings.</p>
          <p>Philip. What do you say ? Did it appear to you to <lb/>
            be of advantage-the giving yourself up to be deceived <lb/>
            out-and-out by the prophets ?</p>
          <p>Alexander. Not that; but the non-Greeks were struck <lb/>
            with consternation, and not one of them any longer re­ <lb/>
            sisted, thinking that they were fighting with a divine <lb/>
            being; so that I kept gaining victories over them with the <lb/>
            greater ease.</p>
          <p>Philip. And what people worth fighting with did you <lb/>
            gain victories over, you who always came into conflict with <lb/>
            cowards, defending themselves with miserable bows and <lb/>
            paltry light shields, and Persian bucklers of osier-twigs ? 1 <lb/>
            To conquer Hellenes-Bœotians, Phokians, and Athenians <lb/>
            -was an achievement, and to utterly defeat the heavy- <lb/>

            were great deeds.1 But as for Medes, and Persians, and <lb/>
            Babylonians, and gold-equipped and effeminate soldiers, do <lb/>
            you not know that ten thousand men, who marched up with <lb/>
            Klearchus, vanquished them before your time; while they <lb/>
            did not endure even so much as to come to close conflict, <lb/>
            but fled before an arrow reached them ?</p>
          <p>Alexander. But the Scythians, father, and the elephants <lb/>
            of the Hindus was not a kind of work to be lightly despised. <lb/>
            And yet, without stirring up dissensions among them, or <lb/>
            purchasing my victories with treasons, I got the mastery <lb/>
            over them; nor did I ever perjure myself, or falsify my <lb/>
            promise, or commit any breach of faith for the sake of <lb/>
            conquest. And, as regards the Hellenes, while some I <lb/>
            received under ray dominion without bloodshed, as for the <lb/>
            Thebans, you probably know by report how I punished <lb/>
            them.</p>
          <p>Philip. I know all this ; for Kleitus brought me word, <lb/>
            whom you murdered with your own hand while at dinner <lb/>
            by running him through with a hunting-spear, because he <lb/>
            dared to eulogize me by comparison with your deeds. Well,. <lb/>
            you threw aside the Macedonian short cloak and exchanged <lb/>
            it, as they say, for the Persian flowing robe,2 and put on. <lb/>

            imitate the manners of the conquered ! I omit to mention <lb/>
            all your other bad actions,-your shutting up men of cul­ <lb/>

            first to leap down within the fortifications, and received so <lb/>
            many wounds ?3</p>
          <p>Philip. I don't commend this conduct, Alexander, not <lb/>
            because I don't think it to be honourable for the king <lb/>
            sometimes to get wounded, and to incur danger on behalf of <lb/>
            his army, but because such conduct least of all suited your <lb/>
            character. For if, with the reputation of being divine, <lb/>
            you had ever received a wound, and they had seen you <lb/>

            Lysimachus with a lion of heroic size in Syria. Justin (Hist. Philip, <lb/>

              afraid of you ? But tell me, in the name of your own <lb/>
              Herakles—when he was alive, did you associate with him <lb/>
              at that time as his ghost; or, were you one and the same <lb/>
              during your life, and, when you died, did you separate and <lb/>
              did he fly off to heaven, and you, the ghost, as was natural, <lb/>
              come to Hades ?</p>
          <p>Herakles. I ought not even to have replied to a man who <lb/>
            talks thus lightly. However, pray, just hear this, too. As <lb/>
            much as there was of Amphitryon in Herakles,l that has <lb/>
            died, and I am all that; but what there was of Zeus is <lb/>
            living with the Gods in heaven.</p>
          <p>Diogenes. Now I clearly understand. For Alkmene gave <lb/>
            birth, you imply, to two Herakleses at the same time-the <lb/>
            one by Amphitryon, and the other from Zeus; so that, with­ <lb/>
            out its being known, you were twins, born of the same <lb/>
            mother.</p>
          <p>Herakles. No, vain trifler: why, we both were one and <lb/>
            the same person.</p>
          <p>Diogenes. It's not so easy to understand this-that there <lb/>
            were two Herakleses compounded into one-excepting, per­ <lb/>
            haps, in the manner, as it were, of some hippo centaur, you <lb/>
            had grown together, man and god.</p>
          <p>Herakles. What! don't you suppose all men to be so com­ <lb/>
            posed of two parts-soul and body ? So what is to hinder <lb/>
            the soul from being in heaven, which was from Zens, and <lb/>
            the mortal part-myself-from being with the dead ?</p>
          <p>Diogenes. Nay, most excellent son of Amphitryon, you <lb/>
            would have fairly advanced that argument if you were a <lb/>
            body; but now you are a bodiless ghost. So you are <lb/>
            perilously near making Herakles just now into a trinity.</p>
          <p>Herakles. How a trinity ?</p>
          <p>Diogenes. In this way about. If the one, whoever it is,. <lb/>
            is in heaven, and the one who is with us are you the ghost, <lb/>
            while your body has already been dissolved and become <lb/>
            dust on Æta,2 these surely are three. And consider, there­ <lb/>
            fore, whom you will devise for the third parent for your <lb/>
            body.3</p>

          <p>Menippus. Your experience is somewhat of the miracu­ <lb/>
            lous, Tantalus. But tell me why, pray, have you even <lb/>
            any need to drink ? For you have no body; but that which <lb/>
            could suffer hunger and thirst, lies buried somewhere in <lb/>
            Lydia: and as for you, the spirit, how can you any longer <lb/>
            be thirsty, or drink ?</p>
          <p>Tantalus. That's the very nature of the punishment-that <lb/>
            my spirit should thirst as though it were body.</p>
          <p>Menippus. Well, I will believe it to be so, since you declare <lb/>
            you are being punished by the feeling of thirst. But <lb/>
            what, pray, will there be terrible to you in that ? Is it that <lb/>

            that can't be, for I do not observe another Hades after this <lb/>
            one, or another death to go to, from here to another place ?</p>
          <p>Tantalus. You are right, and this, in fact, is part of my <lb/>
            sentence-the longing to drink, without having any need to <lb/>
            do so.</p>
          <p>Menippus. You talk nonsense, Tantalus ; and you seem <lb/>
            truly enough to be in need of a draught-unmixed belle­ <lb/>
            bore, by heaven !-who have experienced a fate the opposite <lb/>
            to that of those who have been bitten by mad dogs,1 since <lb/>
            you are afraid, not of water, but of thirst.</p>
          <p>Tantalus. Not even hellebore, Menippus, do I refuse to <lb/>
            drink ; let me only have it.</p>
          <p>Menippus. Keep up your spirits, Tantalus, since neither <lb/>

          <p>Æakus. Why are you falling upon Helen, and throttling <lb/>
            her, Protesilaus ?</p>
          <p>Protesilaus. Why ? Because it was through her I met <lb/>
            with my death, Æakus, leaving behind me my house half­ <lb/>
            finished, and my newly-married wife a widow.</p>
          <p>Æakus. Blame Menelaus, then, who led you to Troy, <lb/>
            for the sake of such a woman.</p>
          <p>Protesilaus. You are right. It's he I have to call to <lb/>
            account.</p>
          <p>Menelaus. No, not me, my fine sir, but Paris more likely, <lb/>
            who, contrary to every principle of justice, ran off with the <lb/>
            wife of his host-myself. Why, this fellow deserves to be <lb/>
            throttled not by you only but by all Hellenes and foreigners, <lb/>
            seeing he has been the cause of death to such numbers.</p>
          <p>Protesilaus. Better so. Never, therefore, I assure you, <note type="footnote"> 1 A prince of Thessaly who led a number of confederated Thessalian <lb/>

            him by the throat).</p>
          <p>Paris. Then you do an injustice, Protesilaus, and that, <lb/>
            too, to your fellow-craftsman. For I myself, also, am a <lb/>
            devotee of Eros, and am held fast prisoner by the same <lb/>
            divinity. And you know how involuntary a sort of thing <lb/>
            is love, and how a certain divinity drives us wherever he <lb/>
            wishes, and it is impossible to resist him.</p>
          <p>Protesilaus. You are right. Would therefore it were <lb/>
            possible for me to get hold of Eros here !</p>
          <p>Æakus. I will maintain the cause even of Eros against <lb/>
            you. Why, he would himself acknowledge that, likely <lb/>
            enough, he was the cause, as regards Paris, of his falling in <lb/>
            love; but that of your death, Protesilaus, no one else was <lb/>
            the cause but yourself, who, entirely forgetful of your <lb/>
            newly-married wife, when you brought your ships up at <lb/>
            the Troad, so rashly and foolhardily leapt out before the <lb/>
            rest, enamoured of glory; on account of which you were <lb/>
            the first, in the disembarkation, to die.</p>
          <p>Protesilaus. Then, I shall, in defence of myself, make a <lb/>
            still juster reply to you, Æakus. You will confess it, for it <lb/>
            is not I am'responsible for all this, but Destiny, and the <lb/>
            fact that my thread of life was so spun2 from the first.</p>

            and Palamedes.</p>
          <p>Menippus. None the less I would wish to have a look at <lb/>
            him, if he is anywhere here.</p>
          <p>Æakus. Do you see the bald-headed man ?</p>
          <p>Menippus. All of them are bald-headed together. So <lb/>
            that would be the distinguishing mark of all.</p>
          <p>Æakus. I mean the snub-nosed one.</p>
          <p>Menippus. That, too, is all. one; 1 for they are the whole <lb/>
            lot of them all snub-nosed.</p>
          <p>Sokrates. Is it me you are inquiring for, Menippus ?</p>
          <p>Menippus. Yes, indeed, Sokrates.</p>
          <p>Sokrates. How go things in Athens ?</p>
          <p>Menippus. Many of the young men say they are engaged <lb/>
            in philosophy. And if one were to regard their ways of <lb/>
            dressing and walking alone, they are tip-top philosophers.</p>
          <p>Sokrates. I have seen very many of them.</p>
          <p>Menippus. But you have observed, I suppose, in what <lb/>
            style Aristippus 2 came to you, and Plato himself ; the one <lb/>
            reeking of perfume, and the other after having thoroughly <lb/>

          </ab>
          <p>Menippus. My friend Kerberus-for I am your kinsman, <lb/>
            being myself a dog, too,1—tell me, in the name of the Styx, <lb/>
            what was Sokrates like when he was coming down to us : <lb/>
            it is to be expected that you, as you are divine, not only <lb/>
            bark but also utter human sounds whenever you have a <lb/>
            mind to do so.</p>
          <p>Kerberus. At a distance, Menippus, he appeared, in every <lb/>
            way, to be approaching with undisturbed countenance, <lb/>
            seeming to fear death in no great degree, and desirous to <lb/>
            make this evident to those who stood outside the entrance. <lb/>
            But when be stooped down and peered within the yawning <lb/>
            cavern, and saw the darkness, and when I gave him a bite <lb/>
            as he was long dallying with the hemlock,2 and dragged <lb/>
            him down by the foot, he began to squall like an infant, and <lb/>
            to bewail his little children, and to take all possible forms <lb/>
            in his terros.3</p>
          <p>Menippus. Was then the fellow a mere sophist? and did <lb/>
            he not, in fact, have contempt for the event of death ?</p>
          <p>Kerberus. No, he had not; but when, in fact, he saw <note type="footnote"> 1 See N. A. i.; <foreign xml:lang="grc">Περὶ Πένθούς</foreign>, 4; <foreign xml:lang="grc">Μενίπποςἢ Νεκυομ</foreign>. 10; Aristoph. <foreign xml:lang="grc">Βατρ</foreign>. <lb/>

            of the monster adorning its back and forming its tail. See Apollod. ii. <lb/>
            5, 12. The Do-, it has been observed, has been deified (in the two <lb/>

            islands, and advanced as far as Miletus, overrunning the <lb/>
            greater part of Ionia. And I was handsome and great, <lb/>
            and strenuous in wars. But, what is greatest reason of all, <lb/>
            is that I possess in Halikarnassus a very great monument <lb/>
            lying over me, of dimensions such as no other dead man <lb/>
            has; nay, nor one so elaborately beautified-horses and <lb/>
            men having been copied with the greatest accuracy in the <lb/>
            most beautiful marble-of such sort as one could not easily <lb/>
            find even a temple. Seem I not to you justly to be high <lb/>
            and mighty on those grounds ?</p>
          <p>Diogenes. On account of your kingdom, you say, and <lb/>
            your handsome appearance, and the weight of your tomb ?</p>
          <p>Mausolus. Assuredly, on those grounds.</p>
          <p>Diogenes. But, my handsome Mausolus, neither that <lb/>
            power of yours nor your figure any longer pertains to you. <lb/>
            If, however, we should choose some judge of good looks, I <lb/>
            am unable to say why your skull should be preferred to <lb/>
            mine; for both are bald and bare, and we display our <lb/>
            teeth with equal prominence, we are both deprived of our <lb/>
            eyes, and have been both provided with snub-noses. And <lb/>
            as for your tomb, and those costly marbles, they, perhaps, <lb/>
            may be of use to the good people of Halikarnassus, to show <lb/>
            off for their own benefit and to get honour for themselves <lb/>
            from strangers and visitors as having, no doubt, a certain <lb/>
            big building. But as for you, my fine Sir, I don't see what <lb/>
            benefit you derive from it, unless 1 you affirm this-that <lb/>
            you bear a heavier burden than we, inasmuch as you are <lb/>

            to me, and will Mausolus and Diogenes have an equality <lb/>
            of privilege ?</p>
          <p>Diogenes. Not an equality of privilege, most excellent <lb/>

            in remembering his possessions above ground, in which he <lb/>

            undesired by most people ?</p>
          <p>Cheiron. I will tell you, as you are not altogether with­ <lb/>
            out sense. I had no longer any pleasure to get from <lb/>
            immortality.</p>
          <p>Menippus. It was no pleasure to you to live and see the <lb/>
            light of day ? 2</p>
          <p>Cheiron. No, Menippus, for I, for my part, hold pleasure <lb/>
            to be. something which is variable, and not simple. But I <lb/>
            was always living and in the enjoyment of the same things <lb/>
            — sun, light, food ; and there were the same seasons, and <lb/>
            everything happened, each in its own order, following, as <lb/>
            it were, one after the other—I became, therefore, satiated <lb/>
            with them : for my pleasure was dependent not on its per­ <lb/>

            endure the state of things in Hades, ever since you came <lb/>
            here by preference ?</p>
          <p>Cheiron. Not disagreeably, Menippus, for your equality <lb/>
            is very democratic, and the circumstance of being in day­ <lb/>
            light or in darkness brings no difference with it: besides, <lb/>
            one has not to be thirsty nor hungry, as up above, for we <lb/>
            are without all those wants.</p>
          <p>Menippus. Take care, Cheiron, that you are not caught <lb/>
            in your own words, and your argument does not come <lb/>
            round to the same thing.</p>
          <p>Cheiron. How do you mean ?</p>
          <p>Menippus. That if everlasting sameness and similarity <lb/>
            of human life was the cause of your ennui, here, too, the <lb/>
            sameness of things must be equally matter for satiety for <lb/>
            you; and you will be obliged to seek some means of mi­ <lb/>
            grating from here, also, to another life, a thing which, I <lb/>
            imagine, is impossible.</p>
          <p>Oheiron. What should one do, then, Menippus ?</p>
          <p>Menippus. According to what is commonly said, I suppose <lb/>
            that a sensible man is pleased and content with his present <lb/>
            circumstances, and thinks none of them intolerable.</p>

            and claimed it as his right that a horse should be supplied <lb/>
            to him; and, in fact, his horse had died with him, both <lb/>
            having been run through, at one stroke, by some Thracian <lb/>
            peltast, in the engagement on the Araxes with the <lb/>
            Kappadocian.1 For Arsakes charged, as he declared to <lb/>
            us, far in advance of the rest; while the Thracian, awaiting <lb/>
            the attack, covers himself with his round shield, and wards <lb/>
            off the spear-shaft of Arsakes, and, couching his own <lb/>
            Macedonian lance, runs him and his horse through at the <lb/>
            same time.</p>
          <p>Antisthenes. How was it possible for that to be done at <lb/>
            one stroke, Krates ?</p>
          <p>Krates. Very easily, Antisthenes. For he began charging, <lb/>
            pushing before him a spear-shaft of twenty cubits ; while <lb/>
            the Thracian, when with his shield he warded off from <lb/>
            himself the onslaught, and the spear-point passed him, <lb/>
            sank on his knees, and received the attack with his spear, <lb/>
            and wounds the horse under the chest, who ran himself <lb/>
            through by his own ardour and the vehemence of his speed. <lb/>
            And as for Arsakes, he is run right through from the groin <lb/>
            to the buttocks. You see something of what it was like r <lb/>
            the action was rather that of the horse than of the hero. <lb/>
            He was indignant, nevertheless, at being on a level with <lb/>
            the rest in point of dignity, and considered it as his right to <lb/>
            come down in the capacity of a knight. But as for Oroetes, <lb/>
            he was very tender-footed, and was not able even to stand <lb/>
            on the ground, not to say anything of walking-all Medes, <lb/>
            in point of fact, have this experience, on dismounting from <lb/>
            their horses : they walk as though upon thorns, on tiptoe, <lb/>

            but, leaving them to lament, I ran forward to the ferry- <lb/>

            I was exceedingly entertained by them all.</p>
          <p>Diogenes. You, Krates, and you, Antisthenes, chanced to <lb/>
            tall in with fellow-travellers of such description. My <lb/>
            fellow-travellers down were Blepsias the money-lender, <lb/>
            from Pisa, and Lampis of Akarnania, who had been <lb/>
            captain of mercenaries, and Damis the millionaire, he <lb/>
            of Korinth. Damis died from poison administered by his <lb/>
            son ; Lampis cut his own throat for love of Myrtium, the <lb/>
            celebrated courtesan; while Blepsias, the poor wretch, was <lb/>
            said to have slowly starved to death ; and he showed it <lb/>
            clearly enough, appearing pallid to excess, and attenuated <lb/>
            to the most extreme point. I, although aware of the <lb/>
            facts, began to question them as to the manner of their <lb/>
            deaths. Then, when Damis was accusing his son, " You <lb/>
            suffered, however, no unjust fate at his hands," said I, <lb/>
            ‟ since, while you at once possessed a quarter of a million, <lb/>
            and lived in luxury yourself, nonagenarian as you were, <lb/>
            you used to supply a youth of eighteen with just sixpence. <lb/>
            And as for you, Air. Akarnanian (for he, too, was uttering <lb/>
            groans, and imprecating curses on Myrtium), why do you <lb/>
            blame Eros, when you ought to accuse yourself ? you who, <lb/>
            while you never trembled at the enemy in battle, but used <lb/>
            to fight, regardless of danger, in the front ranks, were <lb/>
            caught, admirable man, by the made-up tears and sighs of <lb/>
            a common prostitute !1As for Blepsias, he anticipated * <lb/>

            we must watch and observe carefully the arrivals, while yet <lb/>
            at a distance. Bah ! they are numerous and various enough, <lb/>
            and all in tears, except these newly-born children and <lb/>
            infants. Nay, even the very old fellows are bewailing <lb/>
            themselves. What’s this ? Has the magic potion of life, <lb/>
            forsooth, got them under its influence ? However, I want <lb/>
            to question this superannuated old man.—What are you <lb/>
            weeping about, dying at your time of life ? Why are you <lb/>
            indignant, my fine Sir, and that, when you have arrived at <lb/>
            a good age ? You were, doubtless, some king?</p>
          <p>Poor Man. Not at all.</p>
          <p>Diogenes. Well, some satrap or other?</p>
          <p>Poor Man. Not that, even.</p>
          <p>Diogenes. Then you were, doubtless, a rich man, and it <lb/>
            troubles you, I suppose, to have died and left behind you <lb/>
            much luxury ?</p>
          <p>Poor Man. Nothing of that sort; on the contrary, I had <lb/>
            arrived at about the full age of ninety years, and led a life <lb/>
            of want, sustained by means of my fishing-rod and line, <lb/>
            excessively poor, childless, and lame, into the bargain, and <lb/>
            half blind.</p>
          <p>Diogenes. Then, though you were in such a condition, did <lb/>
            you wish to go on living ?</p>
          <p>Poor Man. Yes, for the light of day was sweet to me, <lb/>
            and to die is a terrible thing and to be avoided.</p>
          <p>Diogenes. You are bereft of your senses, old man, and <lb/>
            behave in the face of inevitable Necessity like a child; and <lb/>
            that, though you are a contemporary of the Ferryman there. <lb/>

            it is no longer easy to distinguish; for the eyes of all <lb/>
            of us alike are empty, and only their sockets remain ; and, <lb/>

            prophet, and that you are the only one who has ever been <lb/>
            of both sexes-both a man and a woman—I am aware, <lb/>
            having heard so from the poets. In heaven's name, there­ <lb/>

          <p>Menippus. Have you not heard, Teiresias, the Medeia of <lb/>

            wretched, and having to undergo certain intolerable pangs <lb/>
            -those of childbirth ? 1 But tell me—for the iambics of <lb/>
            Medeia remind me of it-did you ever have a child, when <lb/>
            you were a woman, or did you continue barren and un­ <lb/>
            fruitful in that state of life?</p>
          <p>Teiresias. Why do you ask that, Menippus ?</p>
          <p>Menippus. No offence intended, Teiresias; but answer <lb/>
            me, if it is agreeable to you.</p>
          <p>Teiresias. I was not barren, and yet I did not have a <lb/>
            child at all.</p>
          <p>Menippus. That's quite enough. If you had a womb, in <lb/>
            fact—I wished to know that.</p>
          <p>Teiresias. Of course I had.</p>

            peared, and the sexual part was obstructed, and your <lb/>
            breasts were removed, and the manly parts sprang into <lb/>

            from being a woman turn out a man ?</p>

            doubt in these cases, Teiresias; but, like some simpleton <lb/>
            who doesn't inquire into the truth, must one receive them <lb/>
            as gospel, whether they are possible or not ?</p>
          <p>Teiresias. Do you not, pray, believe other things to have <lb/>
            so happened as they are related—when, for example, you hear <lb/>
            that certain persons have been changed from women into <lb/>

            they say. But you, my fine Sir, when you were a woman, <lb/>
            did you play the prophet then, as afterwards, or did you <lb/>
            learn to be man and prophet at the same time ?</p>
          <p>Teiresias. Just see. You are ignorant of everything that <lb/>
            concerns me—how I put an end to a certain quarrel among <lb/>
            the gods, and how Hera blinded me, in consequence; and <lb/>

          <p>Menippus. Do you still stick to your lies, Teiresias ? <lb/>

          <p>Sostratus. However, answer me, Minos : for I will put <lb/>
            briefly a certain question to you.</p>
          <p>Minos. Speak, let it only not be long, that we may pass <lb/>
            judgment on the rest of them forthwith.</p>
          <p>Sostratus. Whatsoever actions I performed in my life, <lb/>
            whether did I do them, of my own free will, or had they <lb/>
            been spun out for me by the Fate ? 1</p>
          <p>Minos. By the Fate, to be sure.</p>
          <p>Sostratus. Well, then, did all of us who have the repu­ <lb/>
            tation of being good or bad, do those actions of ours as <lb/>
            subservient to her ?</p>
          <p>Minos. Certainly to Klotho, who appoints to each one at <lb/>
            birth what he is to do.</p>
          <p>Sostratus. If, then, a man, forced by another, should <lb/>

            pulsion, such as a public executioner or an officer of the <lb/>
            guard-the one obeying the judge, the other the prince­ <lb/>
            whom would you charge with the murder ?</p>
          <p>Minos. It is clear one would have to charge the judge or <lb/>
            prince; since it is not the sword itself we must accuse,2 for <lb/>
            that, as the instrument for his rage, is merely the minister <lb/>
            of him who first gave the occasion for its use.</p>
          <p>Sostratus. Bravo, Minos, for giving more forcible illus­ <lb/>

            to whom must one attribute the favour, or whom must one <lb/>
            register as the benefactor ?</p>
          <p>Minos. The sender ; for the carrier is an agent merely.</p>

            <title type="main">ZEUS THE TRAGEDIAN.</title>
          </head>
          <p>[ZEUS, gloomy and in tragic distress, is implored by <lb/>
            Hermes and Athena to divulge the cause of his melan­ <lb/>
            choly condition; while Hera, true to her Homeric character, <lb/>
            confidently attributes it to another earthly amour. The <lb/>
            king of gods and men, thus adjured, announces the true <lb/>
            reason of his anxiety-flaring assaults upon the character <lb/>
            of himself and the rest of the Olympian divinities, and, in <lb/>
            fact, denial of their very existence, by the skeptics, repre­ <lb/>
            sented by an Epikurean philosopher named Damis ; and the <lb/>
            weakness of the arguments of their over-zealous apologists, <lb/>
            the Stoics, represented by a champion named Timokles: <lb/>
            which all-important controversy he had chanced to over­ <lb/>
            hear when present, on the day preceding, at a sacrificial <lb/>
            feast given to the Gods at Athens.</p>
          <p>He proceeds to request the opinions of the three divini­ <lb/>
            ties upon the best course to be pursued, in the emergency. <lb/>
            Hera and Hermes propose a Council of the Gods; Athena, <lb/>
            a private settlement of the business. The former opinion <lb/>
            prevails, and Zeus directs Hermes to summon the rest of <lb/>
            the Gods to a general Council, which the Olympian herald <lb/>
            proceeds to do in the orthodox Homeric style, after some <lb/>
            reluctance on account of his want of poetic skill, and in <lb/>
            face of the discouraging example of Apollo, whose pro­ <lb/>
            phetic utterances (in verse) had become the object of so <lb/>
            much ridicule. Some difficulty arises, at the outset, on <lb/>
            the question of precedence, both because (the representative <lb/>
            statues of the divinities being variously formed of gold, <lb/>
            silver, ivory, and bronze) it was a question whether it <lb/>
            should be decided by the material, or by the excellence of <lb/>
             <pb n="169"/>
            the workmanship; and, also, by reason of the numerous <lb/>
            recent additions to their august body. Zeus rules that <lb/>
            gold must have the preference. By this decision the old­ <lb/>
            established, genuine Hellenic divinities find themselves <lb/>
            forced to give way to the novi homines, not without much <lb/>
            and protracted squabbling. In the end, by the ruling of <lb/>
            the president, the members of the celestial Senate have to <lb/>
            take their places promiscuously, on the principle of " first <lb/>
            come first served."</p>
          <p>Silence having been secured, Zeus rises to open the <lb/>
            deliberations. An unaccustomed nervousness and hesita­ <lb/>
            tion threaten to spoil his exordium, and even to ruin every­ <lb/>
            thing, by raising suspicion of the soundness of their cause. <lb/>
            At length, at the suggestion of Hermes, discarding the <lb/>
            well-worn Homeric exordium, he opens in the words of a <lb/>
            famous oration of Demosthenes. He sets forth the cause <lb/>
            of the summoning of the Council, and reports the circum­ <lb/>
            stances which led to his presence at the dispute between <lb/>
            the Epikurean and Stoic champions, in the Painted Porch <lb/>
            at Athens, and its fortunate interruption at a critical <lb/>
            moment by the pressure of the crowd, with its consequent <lb/>
            adjournment. The Gods, whom age and standing permit, <lb/>
            are then invited to deliver their several opinions upon the <lb/>
            course of action to be adopted. Momus, the Censor of the <lb/>
            Olympian Court, rises, and, with his usual candour, affirms <lb/>
            that the objections and arguments of their avowed enemies <lb/>
            are not at all to be wondered at; and, in fact, himself <lb/>
            points to the prevalence of injustice and cruelty, the <lb/>
            triumph of the bad, and the oppression and sufferings of <lb/>
            the good on the Earth. He takes occasion to ridicule the <lb/>
            studied ambiguity and obscurity of Apollo and his oracular <lb/>
            prophecies, and the mischiefs arising from them ; and next <lb/>
            criticises the policy which admitted so many strange and <lb/>
            outlandish divinities to the rights of Olympian Godship.</p>
          <p>Poseidon and Apollo next address the Council; the <lb/>
            former voting for violent and summary measures-nothing <lb/>
            less, in fact, than the destruction of Damis by a thunderbolt; <lb/>
            in which opinion (later) he is vigorously supported by <lb/>
            Herakles. The latter calls attention to the inferiority, and <lb/>
            confused and illogical method, of their apologist, and advises <lb/>
            that an associate-advocate be supplied to him, to whom alone <lb/>
             <pb n="170"/>
            it should be allowed to speak, Timokles acting merely as his <lb/>
            prompter. The opportunity is not lost by Momus for sar­ <lb/>
            castic allusion to Apollo's own confused prophetical style; <lb/>
            and, ridiculing the proposition of an associate-advocate, he <lb/>
            calls upon him opportunely to give some ex tempore speci­ <lb/>
            mens of his oracular faculty. Thus urged, with much <lb/>
            reluctance and diffidence Apollo complies, to the great <lb/>
            entertainment of his censor. At this juncture there arrives <lb/>
            in hot haste, fresh from the yesterday's scene of verbal <lb/>
            conflict at the Painted Porch, Hermagoras, a statuary, who, <lb/>
            like the Ephesian town-clerk, may be supposed to have <lb/>
            been a not entirely disinterested well-wisher to the Olym­ <lb/>
            pian Establishment. In iambic verse he announces the <lb/>
            approaching renewal of hostilities, in the oracular strain so <lb/>
            dear to Apollo, and so well known to readers of Herodotus, <lb/>
            of the ’<foreign xml:lang="grc">Ορνίθες</foreign> and ’<foreign xml:lang="grc">Ιππε</foreign>ĩ<foreign xml:lang="grc">ς</foreign> of Aristophanes, and of Lucian.</p>
          <p>The Celestials arrange themselves in attitudes of eager ex­ <lb/>
            pectancy ; and the verbal duel below begins with a vitupera­ <lb/>
            tive onslaught (in which controversial virtue Zeus recognizes <lb/>
            their champion's strength to lie) on the part of Timokles, and <lb/>
            a dispute on the question upon which of the two rested the <lb/>
            onus probandi. This being settled, at length, by the con­ <lb/>
            cession of Damis in favour of his opponent, the combatants <lb/>
            engage in earnest. As the fortune of the day seems to <lb/>
            incline to this side or that, the celestial -spectators express, <lb/>
            chorus-like, their hopes or fears-the latter, however, very <lb/>
            greatly preponderating; Momus not omitting to exercise <lb/>
            his powers of sarcasm. Timokles, after vainly throwing <lb/>
            overboard his sheet-anchor-in the shape of a remarkable <lb/>
            syllogism-takes refuge, as his opponent tauntingly ex­ <lb/>
            presses it, at the altars. Damis, claiming the victory, now <lb/>
            retires from the scene, pursued by the vituperation and <lb/>
            even missiles and blows of his enraged antagonist. The <lb/>
            celestial clients of Timokles disperse, consoled by the re­ <lb/>
            flection of Hermes, that, in spite of all the arguments of <lb/>
            the wicked philosophers, at all events the larger part of <lb/>
            the world, Greek as well as barbarian, will continue to be <lb/>
            on their side, and not cease to supply them with the rich <lb/>
            steams of sacrifice. Zeus, however, cannot refrain from <lb/>
            the expression of his feeling, that he would rather have <lb/>

          <p>Hera. But what else, if not this, annoys you-con­ <lb/>
            sidering you are Zeus himself ?</p>
          <p>Zeus. In peril dire, affairs divine are placed, and here is <lb/>
            the proverb verified, Hera, " it now stands upon a razor's <lb/>
            edge," 1 whether we are to have honour any longer paid to <lb/>
            us, and to have our accustomed honours on Earth, or, in <lb/>
            fact, to be altogether neglected, and to have no reputation <lb/>
            at all.</p>
          <p>Hera. The Earth has not produced any Giants again, <lb/>
            has it ? Or have the Titans burst their chains, and over­ <lb/>
            powered their guard, and do they once again take up arms <lb/>
            against us ?</p>
          <p>Zeus. Fear not: no danger threatens from below.2</p>
          <p>Hera. What else, pray, could there be to alarm ? For I <lb/>
            don't see, if something of the sort does not distress you, <lb/>
            for what reason you leave your proper character, and come <lb/>

          <p>Zeus. Timokles the Stoic, and Damis the Epikurean, <lb/>
            Hera, yesterday, from some discourse or other begun be­ <lb/>

            in the presence of a very numerous and select audience­ <lb/>
            a circumstance which especially annoys me; and Damis <lb/>
            affirmed that neither have the gods any existence, nor do <lb/>
            they exercise any supervision at all over what happens on <lb/>
            Earth; while Timokles, best of men, endeavoured all he <lb/>
            could to maintain our cause. At this juncture, a dense <lb/>
            mob surging against them, there was no definite conclu­ <lb/>
            sion of the conference ; for they separated, after agreeing <lb/>
            to consider the remaining arguments at some future time. <lb/>

              judged to have the more truth on his side. You see <lb/>
              the danger, how our interests are altogether in a strait, <lb/>

              voted mere names, or we are to be honoured as heretofore, <lb/>
              supposing Timokles shall have the best of the argument.</p>
          <p>Hera. A terrible state of things, this, of a verity; and <lb/>
            not without reason, Zeus, were you acting the tragedian, <lb/>
            under the circumstances.</p>
          <p>Zeus. And you imagined that, in such trouble, I had <lb/>
            thought of a Danae or Antiope !- What now, Hermes, and <lb/>
            Hera, and Aphrodite, should we do ? Do you together, <lb/>
            according to your several ability, devise something.</p>
          <p>Hermes. For my part, I hold you should summon an <lb/>
            Assembly, and refer the consideration of the matter to the <lb/>
            whole body of the Gods.</p>
          <p>Hera. I am exactly of the same way of thinking.</p>
          <p>Athena. I, however, have the contrary opinion, father­ <lb/>
            that we don't throw heaven into utter confusion, nor make <lb/>
            it plain that you are disturbed by the occurrence, but <lb/>
            manage this business privately, in such manner that <lb/>
            Timokles shall have the best of it in argument, and <lb/>
            Damis leave the conference an object of thorough ridicule.</p>
          <p>Hermes. But since the contest of the philosophers will <lb/>
            be in public, these things will not be unknown, Zeus, and <lb/>
            you will have the repute of being tyrannical, should you <lb/>
            not throw open to all a discussion about matters of so much <lb/>
            importance and general interest.</p>
          <p>Zeus. Well, then, make your proclamation at once, and <lb/>
            let all of them put in an appearance-for you are right.</p>
          <p>Hermes. (mounting the bema.) Halloo! I say, come <lb/>
            together, you Gods, to a meeting; don't loiter, come all, in <lb/>
            a body, come ! we shall discuss business of great importance.</p>
          <p>Zeus. Is it in this bare, unornamental, and prosaic style <lb/>
            you make your proclamation, Hermes; and that, too, when <lb/>
            you are summoning them on matters of highest import ?</p>
          <p>Hermes. Well, but how, Zeus, do you require me to do it ? <note type="footnote"> 1 Zeus may have condescended to borrow this expression from the <lb/>
            famous Funeral Oration of Perikles, as reported by Thucydides :-<foreign xml:lang="grc">μὴ <lb/>

          <p>Zeus. How do I require you to do it ? I say you ought <lb/>
            to impart solemnity to your proclamation by some sort of <lb/>
            verse, and with poetical magniloquence, that they may be <lb/>
            induced to assemble with more alacrity.</p>
          <p>Hermes. Yes, but such is the business of versemakers and <lb/>
            professional reciters, while I am not the least of a poet. So <lb/>
            I shall completely spoil my proclamation, by stringing <lb/>
            together verses either with too many or too few feet, and <lb/>
            shall be the object of their ridicule for my want of poetic <lb/>
            skill. In fact, I observe that even Apollo himself is laughed <lb/>
            at for some of his oracular responses,1 although his obscu­ <lb/>
            rity 2 conceals the greater part of his blunders, as his <lb/>
            hearers have not too much leisure for examining his <lb/>
            metrical effusions.</p>
          <p>.eus. Then, Hermes, mix up in your proclamation, <lb/>
            chiefly, verses from Homer, in the manner he was wont to <lb/>
            convene us. Of course, you call them to mind ?</p>
          <p>Hermes. Not so very accurately and readily ; but, all the <lb/>
            same, I will try (much preliminary clearing of the throat):- <lb/>
            Let none of Gods, whate’er the sex, fail to obey my summons, <lb/>
            Nor any River stay behind, except the stream of Ocean, <lb/>
            Nor any Nymph: but haste ye all to swell the lofty Council <lb/>

            part most admirably; and, indeed, they are already rushing <lb/>
            together. So take and seat them, each according to rank, <lb/>
            as it belongs to him by reason of material or art-the <lb/>
            Golden in the front rank, then next to them the Silver; <lb/>
            next in due order all the Ivory ones; after them the <lb/>
            Bronze or the Marble; and among these same let those <lb/>
            of Pheidias, or Alkamenes, or Myron, or Euphranor,l or <lb/>
            of similar artists, have the best places. As for these rabble, <lb/>
            and inartistic fellows, let them be crammed together some­ <lb/>
            where at a distance, and serve only to fill up the House as <lb/>
            dummies.</p>
          <p>Hermes. So it shall be, and they shall take their seats as <lb/>
            is proper. But it's not so easy to know-when any one of <lb/>
            them is of gold, indeed, and of many hundredweight,2 <lb/>
            but not perfect in workmanship, but plainly vulgar and <lb/>
            plebeian, and badly proportioned, shall he seat himself <lb/>
            before the bronze gentlemen of Myron, and of Polykleitus,3 <lb/>
            and of Pheidias, and the marble ones of Alkamenes ? Or <lb/>
            must we consider Art to have precedence ?</p>
          <p>Zeus. So it ought to be; but, all the same, preference <lb/>
            must be given to Gold.4 <note type="footnote"> 1 The first of these most distinguished sculptors and statuaries of <lb/>
            Hellas and the world is sufficiently well known. Alkamenes, the most <lb/>
            eminent of the pupils of Pheidias, was especially famous for a statue of <lb/>
            Aphrodite. Myron, the sculptor of the well-known Discobolos, an elder <lb/>
            contemporary of Pheidias, was the Landseer of Greek sculptors. His Cow <lb/>
            was especially in high repute, and in the Greek Anthologia thirty-six <lb/>
            epigrams celebrate her praise. It was removed from Athens between the <lb/>
            age of Cicero and that of Pausanias. This beautiful statue survived, at <lb/>
            least, tothe sixth century. Of the works of Euphranor, a native of Korinth, <lb/>
            but, like most of the great artists, resident at the " hospitable " Athens, <lb/>
            most celebrated was his representation of Paris, of which the statue in <lb/>

            but, none the less,1 all of marble or bronze, or (at all events) <lb/>
            the most costly of them are ivory, with just a little gold <lb/>

            selves to your several occupations, each according to <lb/>
            his fancy; but I, for it was not yet very late, went up to <lb/>
            the city, to have an evening walk in the Kerameikus,1 <lb/>
            reflecting, at the same time, on the niggardliness of Mnesi­ <lb/>
            theus, who, to entertain sixteen Gods, slaughtered only a <lb/>
            single cock, and that, too, a long since old and wheezy one, <lb/>
            and four grains of exceedingly mouldy incense,2 so that it <lb/>
            was at once consumed on the coals, and did not afford as <lb/>
            much smoke as could be smelled by even the tip of our <lb/>
            nostrils ; and that, though he promised whole hecatombs, <lb/>
            when his ship was just being carried on to the rocks, and <lb/>
            was actually within the breakers. And, when pondering <lb/>
            these things, I find myself near the Stoa,3 I observe a very <lb/>
            large crowd of people jammed together-some within, in <lb/>
            the Hall itself, but many in the open air; and some <lb/>
            persons shouting and vehemently clamouring, seated on <lb/>
            the benches. Guessing then, what indeed was the fact, <lb/>
            that these were philosophers of those contentious sort, I <lb/>
            had a mind to stand by and listen to what they say; and <lb/>
            (for I had enwrapped myself, as it chanced, in a cloud of <lb/>
            the densest), by disguising myself in their fashion, and by <lb/>
            letting down my beard, I had a pretty close resemblance <lb/>
            to a philosopher. Well, I say, elbowing aside the crowd, <lb/>
            I enter without being known who I was. There I find <lb/>
            the Epicurean Damis, the practised villain, and Timokles, <lb/>
            the Stoic, best of men, disputing with uncommon vehe­ <lb/>

            provoked his antagonist. Their whole argument, for­ <lb/>
            sooth, was about us. Why, that accursed Damis was <lb/>
            affirming that neither do we exercise any providence over <lb/>
            men, nor superintend their actions; maintaining nothing <lb/>
            else than our entire non-existence, for that plainly was what <lb/>
            his argument amounted to. There were some who applauded <lb/>
            him. But the other, Timokles, took our' part, and <lb/>
            fought for us vehemently,1 and fell into a passion, and <lb/>
            struggled for us in every possible way, glorifying our pro­ <lb/>
            vidence, and recounting with what beautiful order and <lb/>
            suitable arrangement we plan and dispose each particular <lb/>
            part. He, also, had some backers, but, indeed, he had <lb/>
            already tired himself out, and was speaking badly, and the <lb/>
            majority were beginning to fix their attention entirely on <lb/>
            Damis. I, perceiving all that was imperilled, ordered Night <lb/>

            went off, after agreeing to discuss the subject fully on the <lb/>

            when they see such confusion in human life-their good <lb/>

            slavery ; while thoroughly bad and rascally men are pre­ <lb/>

            their betters ; 1 the sacrilegious 2 not punished, but getting <lb/>
            off scot-free, the innocent impaled alive, or sometimes <lb/>
            beaten to death ? Naturally, then, when they see these <lb/>
            things, do they determine thus about us, as non-existent at <lb/>
            all, especially when they hear the oracles pronounce that a <lb/>
            certain man, by crossing the Halys, will destroy a mighty <lb/>
            kingdom,3 but don't explain, however, whether it is his <lb/>

            wounded in battle,5 and serve as slaves, and are put in <lb/>

            Herakles, and Dionysus, and Ganymedes, and Asklepius,1 <lb/>
            those illegally enregistered Gods there-answer me truly, <lb/>
            if you have ever had so much care for human affairs as <lb/>
            to trouble your head as to who of them are bad, or who <lb/>
            are good. But you cannot say you have. If, in fact, <lb/>
            Theseus on his way from Troezene to Athens, as a sort of <lb/>
            diversion on the journey, had not exterminated those rascals, <lb/>
            as far as depended on you and your providence nothing <lb/>
            would have prevented Skeiron, and Pityokamptes, and <lb/>
            Kerkyon,2 and the rest from being now alive and revelling <lb/>
            in the murders of travellers. Or, unless Eurystheus, a <lb/>
            man of old-fashioned morality and of some forethought, <lb/>
            out of pure philanthropy had investigated the condition of <lb/>
            every people, and despatched his domestic here [pointing to <lb/>
            Herakles], an active fellow, and eager for adventures and <lb/>
            toils, little you would have cared, Zeus, about the Hydra, <lb/>
            and the Stymphalian birds, and the Thracian horses, and <lb/>
            the wanton and drunken insolence of the Kentaurs. Nay, if <lb/>
            the truth must be told, we sit here looking out only for <lb/>
            this-whether there is anyone sacrificing and raising the <lb/>
            fat steam of burnt offerings at the altars, while everything <lb/>
            else is borne down the stream of fate, swept along as the <lb/>
            chance of each directs. Accordingly, we now suffer what <lb/>
            might have been expected, and we shall suffer still, when <lb/>
            men, little by little rising up from their prostrate condition, <lb/>
            shall find that they get no profit by their sacrifices to us <lb/>
            and religious processions. So, I suppose, in a short time, <lb/>
            you will see the Epikuruses, and Metrodoruses,3 and <note type="footnote"> 1 These new “creations," however, were all only semi human, being, <lb/>

          <p>Zeus. Let us leave this fellow, Gods, who is always morose <lb/>
            and critical, to go on talking his nonsense. For, as said <lb/>
            the admirable Demosthenes, to bring charges, to find fault, <lb/>
            and to chide is an easy matter, and within the power of <lb/>
            anyone who wants to do so ; but to take measures how the <lb/>
            present state of things shall be improved, that, of a verity, <lb/>
            is the part of a wise counsellor;2 and this, I am well <lb/>
            assured, the rest of you will do, even though this fellow <lb/>
            hold his tongue.</p>
          <p>Poseidon. Now, I, for my part, live mostly, as you know, <lb/>
            under water, and do my business3 at the bottom of the sea, <lb/>

            protecting voyagers, and escorting ships, and mitigating <lb/>
            the violence of the winds. All the same, however (for I <lb/>
            take an interest, too, in your affairs here), I affirm that we <lb/>
            ought to put this Damis out of the way, before they come <lb/>
            to the contest, either by a thunder-bolt, or by some other <lb/>
            contrivance, for fear he get the better in argument—for <lb/>
            you say, Zeus, he is a persuasive kind of fellow. For we <lb/>
            shall prove to them, at the same time, how we punish those <lb/>

            to incur ridicule in his controversies on that account, from <lb/>
            not connecting his sentences, but stammering and getting <lb/>
            confused; particularly when, though such is his peculiarity, <lb/>
            he wishes to show off his graces of oratory. For, in mere <lb/>
            intelligence, indeed, he is acute and subtle to an excess, as. <lb/>
            say those who best know the learning of the Stoics : but, <lb/>

          <p>Momus. You are perfectly right in this, Apollo, in com­ <lb/>
            mending those who speak clearly, even though you do not <lb/>
            yourself altogether practise it in your oracles ; for you are <lb/>
            ambiguous and enigmatical, and safely marshal them, for <lb/>
            the most part, in a neutral position between both camps,1 so <lb/>
            that the hearers want another Pythian Apollo to interpret <lb/>
            them. But what do you advise next ? what remedy to <lb/>
            apply to the feebleness of Timokles in argument?</p>
          <p>Apollo. To supply, Momus, if by any means we can, another <lb/>
            as his mouth-piece,2 one of those clever fellows, to speak <lb/>
            suitably what the other may think out and suggest.</p>
          <p>Momus. The remark, that, of a beardless youth with a ven­ <lb/>
            geance, and who still needs his tutor-that his mouth-piece <lb/>
            should take his stand by his side, in a conference of philo­ <lb/>
            sophers, to act as interpreter of the sentiments of Timokles <lb/>
            to the audience; and that Damis should speak in his own <lb/>
            person, and by his own mouth, while the other have the <lb/>
            aid of a public interpreter to privately whisper in his ear, <lb/>
            and prompt him to speak his own sentiments ! And an in­ <lb/>
            terpreter is to act the orator, who probably even does not <lb/>
            understand himself what he hears ! How can these things <lb/>
            not be a source of ridicule for the multitude ? Nay, let <lb/>
            us consider this matter in a different fashion. And you, <lb/>
            excellent Sir—for you profess, in fact, to be a prophet, and <lb/>
            have procured no small quantity of profit for such work, so <lb/>
            far even as before now to have received gold bricks3—why <lb/>

          <p>Momus (laughing). There! though you are caught in a <lb/>

          <p>Zeus. All the same, my child, speak, and don't afford this <lb/>

            at your art, as though it depended upon a tripod, and <lb/>

            appliances, you would be deprived of the power of exercising <lb/>
            your art.</p>
          <p>Apollo. It -were better, father, to perform such functions <lb/>
            at Delphi or Kolophon,2 with all my useful tools at hand, as is <lb/>
            my wont. All the same, even though thus destitute of those <lb/>
            things, and unequipped, I will do my endeavour to prophesy <lb/>
            to which of the two the victory will belong. But will you <lb/>
            bear with me, if I should not speak in regular metre ?</p>
          <p>Momus. Speak, but only clearly, Apollo, and not verses <lb/>

          <p>Timokles. Certainly I shall not: rather do you, abomina­ <lb/>

          <p>Damis. No, indeed; you, rather, make answer to me.</p>

            sistrength; since, in other respects, he will shut you up, and <lb/>

          <p>Timokles. No, by Athena! no, I will not answer you first.</p>
          <p>Damis. Then, pray, put your questions, Timokles, for <lb/>
            you have conquered me by that oath: but without bad <lb/>
            language, if you pleased</p>
          <p>Timokles. You say well. Tell me then, accursed villain, <lb/>

            sinner ?</p>
          <p>Damis. Why do you incite the people against me, Timo­ <lb/>
            kles; or, who are you, to be angry on behalf of the Gods, <lb/>
            and that when they themselves are not angry ? At all events, <lb/>
            they have taken no very severe measure against me, though <lb/>
            they have heard me this long time, supposing they do hear.</p>
          <p>Timokles. Yes, Damis, they hear, they do hear, and will <lb/>
            punish you sooner or later, hereafter.</p>
          <p>Damis. And when could they have leisure to look after <lb/>
            me, seeing they have, as you say, so much business on <lb/>
            their hands, in administering the affairs of the universe, in­ <lb/>
            finite in number ? So that they have not even yet punished <lb/>
            you for the perjuries you are constantly committing, and <lb/>
            the rest of your crimes, on which I am silent, that I may <lb/>
            not be myself compelled to use vituperative language, <lb/>
            contrary to our agreement. Yet I do not see what other <lb/>
            greater proof of their providence they could produce than <lb/>
            by making a miserable end of a miserable man like you. <lb/>
            But they are, evidently, away from home, beyond the <lb/>
            Ocean, perhaps, "with the blameless Æthiopians.”1 At <lb/>
            least, it was their custom constantly to go to them to <lb/>
            dinner; sometimes, too, at their own invitation.</p>
          <p>Timokles. What can I say to such shameless ribaldry ?</p>
          <p>jamiM. That particular thing which I have for some time <lb/>
            been longing to hear from you, Timokles—how you were <lb/>
            persuaded to think that the Gods exercise providential <lb/>
            care.</p>

              in the first place, persuaded me—the Sun always holding <lb/>
              the same course, and the Moon in the same way; and <lb/>
              the revolving Seasons, and the growing vegetation, and <lb/>

              and of walking, and of doing carpentry, and making shoes, <lb/>
              and the rest-do not these things appear to you to be the <lb/>
              actions of rational provision ?</p>
          <p>Damis. You are, I take it, begging the very thing in ques­ <lb/>
            tion,1 for it is not yet proved whether each of these things <lb/>
            is effected by rational provision. But that the order of <lb/>
            Nature is such as you say I could readily affirm myself. It <lb/>
            is not, however, a necessary conclusion, to be persuaded <lb/>
            forthwith that it comes about by any intelligent contri­ <lb/>
            vance : for it is possible that, having begun fortuitously, <lb/>
            the universe is now kept together similarly and after <lb/>
            a like fashion. But you call their orderly arrangement <lb/>
            necessity. Next, you will get into a rage, I suppose, should <lb/>
            one not follow you in your enumeration and eulogy of all <lb/>
            things that happen, of whatever sort; and in your belief <lb/>
            that they are a proof of the intelligent ordering of each <lb/>
            one of them by providential design: so that, according to <lb/>
            the comic poet :­ <lb/>
            " Too wretched this : another plea produce." 2</p>
          <p>Timokles. I don't believe there is need of any further <lb/>
            demonstration upon this matter. All the same, however, I <lb/>
            will ask, and answer me then, do you think Homer to be <lb/>
            a most excellent poet ?</p>
          <p>Damis. Of course.</p>
          <p>Timokles. I believed him, then, when he declares the pro­ <lb/>
            vidence of the Gods.</p>
          <p>JamiM. Well, admirable Sir, all persons will concede to <lb/>
            you that Homer was a good poet, but not that, of such matters, <lb/>
            either he or any other poet is a trustworthy witness. For <lb/>
            they care not for truth, I imagine, but for enchanting their <lb/>
            hearers, and, therefore, they charm them by their verses and <note type="footnote"> 1 Avro <foreign xml:lang="grc">που</foreign> TO <foreign xml:lang="grc">ζητούμενον ξυναρπάζεις</foreign>. “You are running off with <lb/>

            with a view to delighting. However, I should be truly glad <lb/>
            to hear by which of Homer's verses you were especially per­ <lb/>
            suaded. Was it, perhaps, those in which he speaks of <lb/>
            Zeus, how his daughter, and brother, and wife formed a <lb/>
            conspiracy to put him in fetters; and, unless Thetis, as <lb/>
            cognisant of the occurrence,1 had summoned Briareus, our <lb/>
            most excellent Zeus would have been carried off and actu­ <lb/>
            ally put into prison ?2 In return for which good offices, <lb/>
            calling to mind his debt of gratitude to Thetis, he <lb/>
            deceives Agamemnon by sending him a certain lying <lb/>
            dream, so that many of the Achæans perished.3 Do you <lb/>
            observe ? It was impossible for him to hurl his thunder­ <lb/>
            bolt and burn up Agamemnon there, on the spot, without <lb/>
            acquiring the reputation of an impostor. Or, is it hearing <lb/>
            these particulars that have chiefly forced you into belief­ <lb/>
            how Diomedes wounded Aphrodite, and afterwards Ares <lb/>
            himself, at the instigation of Athena; and how, a little <lb/>
            after, the Gods themselves engaged in battle, and fought <lb/>
            duels, ladies and gentlemen indiscriminately: and how <lb/>
            Athena conquers Ares, as he had been, I suppose, before­ <lb/>

              or do those stories about Artemis appear to you particularly <lb/>
              worthy of credit-when she complains and is indignant <lb/>
              because she was not invited by CEneus to a feast, and <lb/>
              accordingly sends a certain wild boar, of huge size and <lb/>
              irresistible strength, against his country.1 Is it, indeed, <lb/>
              by such narratives that Homer has persuaded you, pray ?</p>
          <p>.eus (in alarm, to the Gods). Bless me! how the mob shout <lb/>
            applause of Damis! while our man seems like one in <lb/>
            despair. He is certainly afraid, and is all of a tremble, and <lb/>
            evidently is on the point of throwing away his shield,2 and <lb/>
            already is casting about how he shall steal away and escape.</p>
          <p>Timokles. Does not even Euripides, pray, seem to you to <lb/>
            speak with any reason, whenever he mounts the Gods them­ <lb/>
            selves upon the stage ; and represents them as protecting <lb/>
            the good heroes, and crushing the wicked, and wickedness <lb/>
            such as yours ?</p>
          <p>Jainis. But, most admirable of philosophers, if the tragic <lb/>
            poets by so doing have persuaded you, one of two things <lb/>
            must follow: either, that you regard Polus and Aristodemus, <lb/>
            and Satyrus,3 on those occasions, as divine; or, the very <lb/>
            masks of the Gods, and the tragic boots, and the long­ <lb/>
            flowing dresses, and the short mantle, and the flowing <lb/>
            sleeves, and the false paunches, and paddings, and the other <lb/>
            things by which they give the grand air to tragedy: a <lb/>
            supposition which I presume to be highly ridiculous. For, <lb/>
            whenever Euripides, in his own person, is speaking his own <lb/>
            opinions, when the requirement of the dramatic action <lb/>
            does not constrain him, hear him declaring boldly:­ <lb/>
            " See'st thou this vast expanse of air above, <lb/>
            In whose moist arms our Earth is firmly poised ? <lb/>
            That, that for Zeus; that only God accept." <lb/>

            them?</p>
          <p>Damis. Capital, Timokles, for you bring to my mind the <lb/>
            received belief among different nations, from which one <lb/>
            may most certainly be assured that their language about <lb/>
            Deity has nothing sure or certain about it. For many <lb/>
            are their confused contradictions, and some believe and <lb/>
            practise one thing, and some another. The Scythians <lb/>
            offer sacrifices to a Dagger,1 the Thracians to Zamolxis,2 <lb/>
            a runaway slave who came to them from Samos; the <lb/>

            Cyllenians to Phales,4 the Assyrians to a Dove,5 the Per­ <lb/>
            sians to Fire, the Egyptians to Water. Although this water <lb/>
            is a divinity common to all the Egyptians, yet, locally, the <lb/>
            ox is the divinity of the people of Memphis, the onion of <lb/>

          <p>Timokles. Observe what you are about, you impious <lb/>
            sinner-; you are within an ace of overturning the very <lb/>
            seats of the Gods, and their altars, by your argument.</p>
          <p>Damis. Not all the altars, as far as I am concerned, <lb/>
            Timokles; for what great harm indeed arises from them, <lb/>
            so long as they are full of incense and pleasant odours only ? <lb/>
            But I should be glad to see those of Artemis among the <lb/>
            Tauri utterly overturned from their foundations; upon <lb/>
            which the Virgin [Goddess] finds pleasure in such horrid <lb/>
            feasting.1</p>
          <p>Zeus (with tragic air). Whence falls upon us this insu­ <lb/>
            perable misfortune ?-for not one of the divinities does the <lb/>
            man spare, but is as free in language as a carter,2 <lb/>
            " One after other carping at, innocent or guilty." 3</p>
          <p>Momus. Indeed, Zeus, you would find few innocent <lb/>
            among us; and it is just possible the fellow will proceed <lb/>
            and attack even some one of those nearest the throne.</p>
          <p>Timokles. So, then, do you not heed or hear Zeus, even <lb/>
            when he rolls his thunders, you enemy of the Gods ?</p>
          <p>Damis. And how could I fail to hear thunder, Timokles ? <lb/>
            But whether it is Zeus who thunders,4 you might know <lb/>
            better than I, as you have come, perchance, from that quarter, <lb/>
            direct from the Gods. Yet some, who come from Krete, <lb/>
            tell us a different tale-that a certain tomb is shown there; <lb/>

          <p>Momus. This I long ago knew the man would say. <lb/>
            But why, Zens, pray, have you turned so pale, and <lb/>
            why do you let your teeth chatter so with fright ? You <lb/>
            must keep up your spirits, and never mind such paltry <lb/>
            fellows.</p>
          <p>Zeus. How do you say, Momus ? Never mind them! <lb/>
            Don't you see what a number are listening, and how <lb/>
            already they have been convinced, one and all, against us, <lb/>
            and how Danis has fast fettered them, and how he leads <lb/>
            them away by the ears ?</p>
          <p>Momus. However, Zeus, whenever you care to do so, <lb/>
            you may let down your golden chain, and all of them <lb/>
            "Aloft you draw with Earth itself, and Sea, and all within them." I</p>
          <p>Timokles, Tell me, cursed rascal, have you ever before <lb/>
            now been at sea ?</p>
          <p>Damis. Yes, Timokles, often.</p>
          <p>Timokles. Then were you not, on those occasions, carried <lb/>
            along either by the wind blowing upon the mainsail, and <lb/>
            filling out the stay-sails, or by the rowers ? And did a <lb/>
            certain single individual stand at the helm, and guide and <lb/>
            keep the ship safe ?</p>
          <p>Damis. Undoubtedly.</p>
          <p>Timokles. Then, I suppose, the ship did not proceed on <lb/>
            its voyage without being steered. And think you that this <lb/>
            Universe is carried along without a helmsman and ruler ?</p>
          <p>Zeus. Capital! That argument of yours, Timokles, you <lb/>
            drove home with force by your simile.</p>
          <p>Damis. But, 0 Timokles, cherished favourite of heaven, <lb/>

            ship below water are ornamented, the parts above un­ <lb/>

            the one who is idle, and unskilful, and without heart <lb/>
            for his work, in the position of second or third officer ;3 <lb/>

            all the rest, and occupying the highest posts in the vessel; <lb/>
            many persons of good taste or feeling crowded into a corner <lb/>
            of the ship, and trampled upon by those really inferior to. <lb/>
            themselves. Consider, in fact, in what manner Sokrates and <lb/>
            Aristeides made their voyage, and Phokion, who had not even <lb/>
            sufficient bread to eat,4nor even were able to stretch their legs <lb/>

          <p>Such is the state of matters on board your ship, most sa­ <lb/>
            pient Timokles ; -whence those innumerable shipwrecks. Now <lb/>
            if any captain were in command, and observed and ordered <lb/>
            each particular thing; in the first place, he would not be ig­ <lb/>
            norant who are the good, and who the bad among the ship's <lb/>
            company; in the next place, he would suitably distribute to <lb/>
            each his proper post-the better place, up above by his side, to <lb/>
            the better men, and the lower place to the inferior; and some <lb/>
            of the superior men he would admit to his own table, and <lb/>
            appoint them to be of his council; and of the sailors, the most <lb/>
            zealous would have been appointed to the care of the forepart <lb/>
            of the vessel, or to the captaincy of the forecastle,1 or, cer­ <lb/>
            tainly, in a place above the rest: while the sluggish and negli­ <lb/>
            gent would be corrected a dozen times in the day with the <lb/>
            rope's end about his shoulders. So, admirable Sir, this <lb/>
            .simile of yours of the Ship is in some danger of being com­ <lb/>
            pletely wrecked, from having chanced upon this incom­ <lb/>
            petent captain.</p>
          <p>Momus. This contest proceeds swimmingly for Damis <lb/>
            now, and he is being borne onwards full sail to victory.</p>
          <p>Zeus. Rightly do you conjecture, Momus, and as for <lb/>
            Timokles, he devises no firm and consistent method of argu­ <lb/>
            ment : but these commonplace and vulgar proofs he pumps <lb/>
            out one after the other, all only to be easily overturned.</p>
          <p>Timokles. Then, since my comparison of the ship appears <lb/>
            to you to be of no such great weight, listen now to the <lb/>
            “sacred anchor,"2 as the proverb has it, which you will <lb/>
            not shatter by any possible means.</p>
          <p>.eus (all attention). Whatever in the world is he going <lb/>
            -to say, then ?</p>
          <p>Timokles. Well, you shall see if I put these arguments <lb/>
            into syllogistic sequence, and if you can overturn them <lb/>
            anyhow. If there are altars there are also Gods: but there <lb/>
            are certainly altars ; there are, therefore, Gods.3 What do <lb/>

            Tell m.e, however, whereabouts my allegation appears to <lb/>
            you ridiculous.</p>
          <p>DamIt's because you don't perceive you suspended your <lb/>
            anchor, and that, too, " the sacred one," upon a fine thread. <lb/>
            For, in connecting the existence of the Gods with the exis­ <lb/>
            tence of altars, you imagine you have made your anchorage <lb/>
            secure thereupon. So, since you say you have nothing <lb/>
            else " more sacred " than this to say, let us at once depart.</p>
          <p>Timokles. Do you confess, then, you are worsted, as you <lb/>
            leave first ?</p>
          <p>Damis (calmly). Yes, Timokles; for you, like those who <lb/>
            are getting the worst of it, you have sought refuge at the <lb/>
            altars. So, by the " holy anchor," I am ready to make a <lb/>
            treaty of peace with you this moment, with a libation upon <lb/>
            the altars themselves, so that we may no longer wrangle <lb/>
            on these matters.</p>

            couraged by Zeus to ask a favour, protests that his request <lb/>
            will be a very modest one and very easy to grant: he is not <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Ζεὺς 'Ελεγχομέονος</foreign>—“ Zeus Convicted," " Confuted," or " Cross- <lb/>
            Examined." Of this Dialogue Wieland remarks :—" Never, probably, <lb/>
            had any writing a more appropriate title than this, in which Jupiter, <lb/>
            in a tête-à-tête, is forced by the straightforward and undaunted Cynic, <lb/>
            in a way such as, probably, he had never yet experienced from any son <lb/>
            of Earth, to confess the truth. The worst blow, to which dogmas, that <lb/>
            are not grounded upon Reason, can be submitted, is when one holds up <lb/>
            their mutual contradictions to the light. One spares oneself, by this <lb/>
            means, the trouble of refutation, and can calmly see them, like the <lb/>
            armed men sown by Kadmus, annihilate themselves. This is the spec­ <lb/>
            tacle which Lucian gives us, in this Dialogue, in his best manner. </note><note type="footnote"> " The inconsistencies of the Pagan doctrines of a Fate, of the Provi­ <lb/>
            dence of their Gods, and of the system of Rewards and Punishments <lb/>
            after death, appears in it in a light, by whose brilliance Jupiter himself <lb/>
            is quite dazed and reduced to silence ; or, what is still more humiliating, <lb/>
            to so miserable a shift, that Cyniscus himself, at last, out of mere pity, <lb/>
            and content with having deprived him, after complete overthrow in open <lb/>
            field, of his power, his dignity, and his kingdom, and leading him in <lb/>
            triumph mortally wounded, presents him with his life for so long as in <lb/>
            the course of Nature it might be expected to last. The questions which <lb/>
            he lays before Jupiter had, in fact, been already debated in the Jupiter <lb/>
            in Tragedy, between Damis and Timokles, not to the advantage of the <lb/>
            party of the Gods. But Lucian, as it seems, held it to be necessary to <lb/>
            deliver a last decisive assault. Jupiter had to be driven out altogether <lb/>
            from his last lurking-holes, and to be convicted of his wicked deeds so <lb/>
            completely, that the most shameless sycophant must blush any longer <lb/>
            to undertake his defence. This it is, that Lucian, as it seems to me, in <lb/>
            this little Dialogue, in so masterly a way, and with so much fineness of <lb/>
            touch, manages to effect, that I know no more complete example of the <lb/>
            transformation of the antipodes of reason (as Homer expresses it) ' into <lb/>
            earth and water.'" </note> <note type="footnote"> p </note> <lb/>

            going to petition for wealth or power, but simply for en­ <lb/>
            lightenment on certain perplexing points of theology and <lb/>
            metaphysics. He begins with a request to be informed as <lb/>
            to the truth of the statements of Homer and Hesiod <lb/>
            respecting the Fates, and their absolute control over human <lb/>
            life. Zeus assures him of their omnipotence. The apparent <lb/>
            contradictions of the Hellenic Scriptures are easily ex­ <lb/>
            plained by the circumstance that their inspiration had not <lb/>
            been constant: that, when those theologian-poets spoke of <lb/>
            their own free motion, they were, like ordinary mortals, <lb/>
            liable to error ; but everything uttered by them under <lb/>
            direct inspiration of the divinities is entirely to be received.</p>
          <p>Cyniskus then inquires whether Zeus himself acknow­ <lb/>
            ledges subjection to the Fates, to Chance or Fortune (also <lb/>
            the object of the popular Creed) ; and, upon the assent of <lb/>
            the " King of Gods and men," he proceeds to quote the <lb/>
            well-known passage in the Iliad on the " Golden <lb/>
            Chain,”and, sarcastically, remarks that the Fates themselves <lb/>
            more justly might boast of suspending him in mid-air. <lb/>
            Becoming more and more uneasy at every new question, <lb/>
            Zeus professes himself to be at a loss to divine at what his <lb/>
            interlocutor is driving. Nor is his alarm without some <lb/>
            reason, since the Cynic next inquires the purpose of the <lb/>
            hecatombs of slaughtered victims for the altars, and of all <lb/>
            the costly sacrifices ? Instead of direct reply, Zeus takes <lb/>
            occasion to denounce the philosophers and sophists, and their <lb/>
            well-known impiety. Pressed on the question of utility, <lb/>
            he defends the sacrificial system upon the pretext of its <lb/>
            being an outward and visible sign of respect and honour <lb/>
            on the part of men for what is greater and nobler than <lb/>
            themselves. To which the Cynic retorts that one of these <lb/>
            wicked philosophers might be disposed to ask in what con­ <lb/>
            sists the superiority of the Gods, seeing that they are sub­ <lb/>
            ject and subordinate to Fate : for the accident of " immor­ <lb/>
            tality," so far from being an advantage, retains them in <lb/>
            everlasting servitude. Nor, if the Hellenic theology was <lb/>
            to be believed, could it be said that all divinities are in <lb/>
            enjoyment of so much happiness-a positiorrwhich Cyniskus <lb/>
            illustrates by some conspicuous examples. Zeus now resorts <lb/>
            to indirect menaces, and angrily hints at some supernatural <lb/>
            punishment of the audacious sceptic: but the philo­ <lb/>
             <pb n="211"/>
            sopher calmly expresses his confidence that he can suffer <lb/>
            nothing which has not been, by the Fates or Destiny, fore­ <lb/>
            ordained. Besides, he observes that not even the most <lb/>
            audacious insulters of the Gods themselves-the many <lb/>
            plunderers of their temples-seem to be any the worse off <lb/>
            for their sacrilege, while the innocent frequently fall victims <lb/>
            to the indiscriminating thunderbolts.</p>
          <p>Driven to bay, the champion of the orthodox Olympian <lb/>
            theology reprobates the philosopher as one of those who <lb/>
            are for destroying all idea of a divine providence ; Cyniskus <lb/>
            inquires who or what is Providence, and how exercised, and <lb/>
            is told that he is becoming grossly impertinent; but he <lb/>
            extracts the reluctant admission that the Gods, after all, <lb/>
            are nothing but the agents and ministers of Destiny. Zeus, <lb/>
            however, attempts to rescue himself and his colleagues from <lb/>
            the consequent position of utter superfluousness and con­ <lb/>
            tempt by claiming credit for oracles and prophecies. The <lb/>
            Cynic retorts, of whafuse are warnings against the inevitable <lb/>
            -to say nothing of the ambiguous and misleading cha­ <lb/>
            racter of these divine oracles. Zeus makes some feeble <lb/>
            attempt at an apology, and then, not obscurely, threatens <lb/>
            the dernier ressort of the most forcible of his arguments-the <lb/>
            thunderbolt. Cyniskus tauntingly remarks that what is <lb/>
            fated is fated-and he is quite prepared to receive the in­ <lb/>
            evitable. He wishes to know how it happens that such <lb/>
            men as Aristeides, Sokrates, Phokion, suffered, while the <lb/>
            tyrants of the world, for the most part, have been allowed <lb/>
            to flourish. That is easily answered, rejoins the king <lb/>
            of Gods, for are not men to receive their deserts in a future <lb/>
            life ? His unrelenting tormentor retorts once more that, <lb/>
            for his part, he would rather escape certain misery and <lb/>
            suffering in this life than have the offer of not altogether <lb/>
            certain happiness in another state of existence. But, con­ <lb/>
            tinues the Cynic, if Fate or Predestination, ordain and <lb/>
            control everything, how, in fine, can there be any logical <lb/>
            place for a Minos to distribute rewards and punishments ? <lb/>
            Zeus disdains to answer so captious a question, and <lb/>
            stigmatizing his satirical examiner as impudent and sophis­ <lb/>
            tical, abruptly leaves him. As a parting shot, the <lb/>
            Cynic bawling after him desires to learn, particularly, <lb/>
            where, after all, these Fates are to be found-or how they <lb/>
             <pb n="212"/>
            manage to transact so enormous an amount of business, with <lb/>
            their extremely limited number, and ventures to think that <lb/>
            they themselves must have been born under a not too <lb/>
            propitious destiny. As for himself, he professes himself <lb/>
            quite satisfied with the information he has extracted from <lb/>
            the highest authority, and contents himself with the reflec­ <lb/>
            tion, that, as for the points upon which he had failed to <lb/>
            receive information, it was, apparently, not in " the fateS ” <lb/>
            that he should be enlightened.]</p>

          <p>Cyniskus (with wallet and tattered cloak). I will not <lb/>
            trouble you, Zeus, about such matters-asking for wealth, <lb/>
            gold, and kingdoms, which are objects most fervently <lb/>
            prayed for by the rest of the world, and which are not <lb/>
            altogether easy for you to grant. I observe, indeed, that <lb/>
            you generally turn a deaf ear to their prayers.1 But there <lb/>
            is one thing, and that a very easy thing to grant, I did <lb/>
            wish to obtain from you.</p>
          <p>Zeus. What is that, Cyniskus ? For you shall not fail <lb/>
            to get it, especially since, as you say, it is a modest favour <lb/>
            you ask.</p>
          <p>Cyniskus. Just give me an answer in regard to a certain <lb/>
            not difficult question.</p>
          <p>Zeus. Your petition, of a truth, is a small matter and <lb/>
            soon settled : so ask whatever you have a mind to ask.</p>
          <p>Cyniskus. Here it is then, Zeus. You read, doubtless, <lb/>
            you as well as the rest, the poems of Homer and Hesiod. <lb/>
            Tell me, pray, are those things true which these poets have <lb/>
            so magnificently declaimed about Destiny and the Fates­ <lb/>
            that whatever lot they spin out for each mortal, at his <lb/>
            birth, is not possible to be avoided ? 2</p>
          <p>Zeus. Indeed, all that is quite true : for there is nothing <note type="footnote"> 1 See '<foreign xml:lang="grc">Ικαρο-Μένιππος</foreign>, 25. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 See'IX. xx. 128 (the words of Hera) ; <foreign xml:lang="grc">Όδ</foreign>. i. 17-19, 35-40 (where <lb/>

            that the Fates do not ordain; but all things that happen, <lb/>
            whatever they are, are turned upon their spindle; and they <lb/>
            have, each one of them, their final event, from the very <lb/>
            first, strictly determined: nor is it possible or right for it <lb/>
            to be otherwise.</p>
          <p>Cyniskus. Then, when the same Homer, in another part <lb/>
            of his poem, says : <lb/>
            " Lest to the house of Aides, despite of Fate, he send thee,”1 <lb/>
            and that sort of thing, we must say, I suppose, that he is <lb/>
            then talking nonsense ?</p>
          <p>Zeus. Certainly. For nothing could happen so, inde­ <lb/>
            pendently of the law of the Fates-nothing beyond the <lb/>
            stretch of their thread. But, as for the poets, whatever <lb/>
            they sing under the constraining inspiration of the Muses, <lb/>
            that is truth : when, however, the Goddesses desert them, <lb/>
            and they poetize of themselves, on such occasions, I say, <lb/>
            they are liable indeed to error, and are apt to contradict <lb/>
            their former assertions. And they may be pardoned, if, as <lb/>
            they are but men, they don't know the truth, after it has <lb/>
            left them, which, so long as it was present, poured forth its <lb/>
            strains through them.</p>
          <p>Cyniskus. Well, we will say so then. But further <lb/>
            answer me this, too. Are there not three Fates—Klotho, <lb/>
            Lachesis, and Atropos ?</p>
          <p>Zeus. Of course.</p>
          <p>Cyniskus. Destiny,2 then, and Chance-for they, too, are <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Μὴ καὶ ὑπὲρ Μοι̃ραν δόμον "Αϊδος εἰσαΦίκηαι</foreign>, <lb/>

            of Cyniskus, who does not know too well what he was to make out <lb/>
            of all these names, is quite natural. Since, however, Jupiter knows <lb/>
            no more of the matter than other people, so he gets out of the difficulty <lb/>

            power does each of them exercise ? Have they a power <lb/>

            I hear, however, everyone say that nothing is more <lb/>
            powerful than Chance and Destiny.</p>
          <p>Zeus. It is not permissible for you. to know everything, <lb/>
            Cyniskus. And with what purpose, pray, did you ask <lb/>
            this question about the Fates ?</p>
          <p>Oyniskus. I will tell you, if you will tell me first, Zeus, <lb/>
            this too-do they govern you, as well; and is it, really, a <lb/>
            matter of necessity for you to hang suspended by their <lb/>
            thread ?</p>
          <p>Zeus. It is matter of necessity, Cyniskus. But why <lb/>
            did you smile, pray ?2</p>
          <p>Cyniskus. I called to mind those verses of Homer, in <lb/>
            which you have been represented by him as declaiming in <lb/>
            the popular Assembly of the Gods, when you threatened <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Ται̃ς Μοίραις</foreign>—the Latin Parcæ. The Latins gave these dread <lb/>
            divinities the names of Nona, Decuma (or Decima), and Morta (or <lb/>
            Moera), according to an authority quoted by Genius, iii. 16. The ety­ <lb/>
            mology of both <foreign xml:lang="grc">Μοι̃ραι</foreign> and Parcæ seems to be the same, and to denote <lb/>
            the distributive or apportioning powers. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 “ Here, too, Jupiter answers conformably to the Homeric and <lb/>
            popular Theology, which makes the Gods dependent on Fate (Schicksal), <lb/>
            or Necessity (Nothwendigkeit), and, also, even upon the Pares, who <lb/>
            execute the laws of Necessity. As, however, nothing was firm or stereo­ <lb/>
            typed in the Greek Theology, the common belief did not hinder many, <lb/>
            to whom the consequences of such teaching were a stumbling-block, from <lb/>
            thinking otherwise. Pausanias, where he speaks of the statues of Jupiter <lb/>
            Olympius at Megara, gives as the reason why the Horæ and Parcæ are <lb/>
            represented hovering above the God's head, that it was pretty generally <lb/>
            recognized that Pepromene (‘Fate’), is subject to Jupiter alone, and <lb/>
            that the Horcæ are ruled by him, and kept in due order. But Lucian's <lb/>
            Jupiter, weak as he was, had, at least, so much understanding as to <lb/>
            know that a Necessity, subject to his absolute will, could be no Necessity; <lb/>
            and is, accordingly, resolved not to overstrain his power, either in regard <lb/>
            of the Parcæ that hover over his head at Megara, or of the statues and <lb/>
            altars, which, according to the testimony of Pausanias, he possessed <lb/>
            here and there under the name of Moiragetes (' Ruler of the Fates'): <lb/>
            but, rather, with a good grace confessed that not only could he not alter <lb/>
            the laws of Fate, but that he was, as regards his own person, subject to <lb/>
            them. Lucian could with so much the greater justice make his Jupiter <lb/>
            confess this, because the Delphic Apollo himself, when Krœsus bitterly <lb/>
            reproached him after the unlucky event of his war with Cyrus, excused <lb/>
            himself in the same way (Herod. i. 91).”—Wieland. </note> <lb/>

            means of averting evils, nor to obtain any heaven-given good. <note type="footnote"> 1 ’<foreign xml:lang="grc">Ιλ</foreign>. viii. 26. See 0. A. xxi. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 The Homeric hecatomb (lit. "sacrifice of a hundred victims)," hyper­ <lb/>

          <p>Zeus (vehemently). I know where you get those pretty <lb/>
            questions from-from those cursed sophists, who assert that <lb/>
            we don't even exercise any providential superintendence <lb/>
            over men ; and without doubt, they ask such questions <lb/>
            out of sheer impiety, diverting the rest of mankind from <lb/>
            sacrifice 1 and vow-making, as being quite useless : seeing, <lb/>
            as they affirm, we neither pay any regard to what is done <lb/>
            among you, nor, in fine, have any power at all in respect <lb/>
            to earthly affairs. However, they shall have no reason to be <lb/>
            pleased by their pursuance of such inquiries.</p>
          <p>Cyniskus (calmly) . No, by the spindle of Klotho, I declare, <lb/>
            Zeus, it was not from being influenced by those people that I <lb/>
            put these questions to you ; but our line of discussion itself, <lb/>
            I don't know how, has gone on till it ended in this-that <lb/>
            sacrifices are supererogatory and superfluous. But again, if <lb/>
            you please, I will put the question to you briefly, and do <lb/>
            not shrink from answering me, and be so kind as to give <lb/>
            a more candid reply than is your wont.</p>
          <p>Zeus. Ask away, if you have leisure to talk such trifling <lb/>
            nonsense.</p>
          <p>Gyniskus. You affirm that everything is done by the <lb/>
            Fates ?</p>
          <p>Zeus. Well, I do.</p>
          <p>Cyniskus. But that it is in your power to alter their <lb/>
            decrees, and to spin them back ?</p>
          <p>Zeus. Not at all.</p>
          <p>Cyniskus. Would you have me, then, lead up to the <lb/>
            necessary consequence, or is it plain enough without my <lb/>
            mentioning it ?</p>
          <p>Zeus. Ob, quite plain. But those who sacrifice, do so, <lb/>
            not on account of any need for it—to make a return, and, <lb/>
            as it were, to purchase good things from us; but, in a <lb/>
            particular manner, out of honour for what is superior to <lb/>
            themselves.2 <note type="footnote"> 1 Zeus, apparently, had quite forgotten the consolatory observation of <lb/>

            altered. According to the generally received text, we read, " but those <lb/>
            who sacrifice do so, not by reason of any need of ours, but to make a </note></p><pb n="217"/>
            
          <p>Cyniskus (triumphantly). That's sufficient—since even <lb/>
            you allow that the sacrifices are of no earthly use, but are <lb/>
            offered simply by way of friendly feeling on the part of men, <lb/>
            who honour the superior power. Yet if any one of those <lb/>
            sophists you speak of were present, he would ask you why <lb/>
            you affirm the Gods to be superior, and that, seeing they <lb/>
            are fellow-slaves with men, and under subjection to the <lb/>
            same mistresses-the Fates. For the plea of immortality <lb/>
            will not avail them, so as, on that account, to gain the re­ <lb/>
            putation of superiority: because that accident, in fact, <lb/>
            makes it far worse for them, seeing that death would have <lb/>
            removed them to a state of freedom; while, as it is, your <lb/>
            business ends only with infinity, and your slavery, wound <lb/>
            up with that long-reaching thread, is everlasting.</p>
          <p>Zeus. But, Cyniskus, that eternity and that infinity of <lb/>
            ours is a blessed one for us, and we live in the enjoyment <lb/>
            of all good things.</p>
          <p>Cyniskus. Not all of you, Zeus. On the contrary, even <lb/>
            among you your concerns have been variously portioned <lb/>
            out, and considerable confusion exists in your midst. Tou, <lb/>
            indeed, are fortunate, for you are king, and can hoist up <lb/>
            Earth and Sea by just letting down a bucket-rope, as it <lb/>
            were. But Hephæstus now, he is lame, and a sort of <lb/>
            mechanic and blacksmith by trade ; as for Prometheus, he <lb/>
            was once upon a time crucified1—and as for your own <lb/>
            father, what shall I say of him, who is still a prisoner in <lb/>
            chains in Tartarus ? They do say that you Gods even <lb/>
            play the gallant, and get wounded in battle, and sometimes <lb/>
            work with men as slaves, as certainly did your own brother <lb/>
            with Laomedon, and Apollo with Admetus. These circum­ <lb/>
            stances don't seem to me to be very happy ones; on the <lb/>
            contrary, some individuals among you appear to be for­ <lb/>
            tunate and lucky, and others the opposite. I omit, in fact, <lb/>
            to mention that you are apt to fall among thieves,2 just <lb/>
            as we are, get robbed by plunderers of your temples, and <note type="footnote"> return for favours received, and, as it were, to purchase good things <lb/>

            I presume, that fate had been destined.</p>
          <p>Zeus (frowning). There! These, now, are mere wanton <lb/>
            insults of yours, Cyniskus. Indeed, you will repent of <lb/>
            them some time or other.</p>
          <p>Cyniskus. Spare your threats, Zeus, as you know that I <lb/>
            shall suffer nothing, which has not been determined by <lb/>
            Fate before you had anything to do with it: since I notice <lb/>
            that not even the robbers of your temples themselves are <lb/>
            all punished; on the contrary, the majority of them get <lb/>
            away from you scot-free. In fact, I suppose it had not <lb/>
            been fated for them to be caught.</p>
          <p>Zeus. Did I not say that you are, without doubt, one of <lb/>
            those fellows who are for doing away with providence by <lb/>
            your style of argument ?</p>
          <p>Cyniskus. You are terribly afraid of them, Zeus, I don't <lb/>
            know why. Everything, in fact, I say, whatever it may <lb/>
            be, you suspect to be their teaching. But I—from whom <lb/>
            else should I learn the truth rather than from you ?—I <lb/>
            should be glad to ask you this, too, who is this " Provi­ <lb/>
            dence " 1 of yours ; is it some Fate, or a divinity even above <lb/>
            her,2 as it were, ruling over the Gods themselves ?</p>
          <p>.eus. I told you already before that it is not lawful or <lb/>
            proper for you to know everything. And you, although at <lb/>
            the beginning you said you would ask a certain single <lb/>
            question, don't stop a moment, putting a number of hair­ <lb/>
            splitting subtleties to me ; and I see it is the chief aim of <lb/>
            your discourse, to prove we exercise no providential care <lb/>
            over human concerns in anything.</p>
          <p>Cyniskus. That is not my affair : but you affirmed, a little <lb/>
            before, that they are the Fates that accomplish everything; <lb/>
            unless, perchance, you repent of making those concessions, <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Πρόνοια</foreign>. " So the Stoics named ‘ Providence' (die Forschung), which <lb/>

            and recall again what you have said, and put in a claim <lb/>
            for " Providence," and thrust Destiny aside altogether.</p>
          <p>.eus. By no means ; on the contrary, it is Fate that <lb/>
            brings each thing to pass through our agency.</p>
          <p>Cyniskus. I understand. You say you are a kind of <lb/>
            agents and ministers of the Fates. But, however, even so, <lb/>
            it would be they who exercise providence, while you are, <lb/>
            as it were, a sort of tools and instruments of theirs.</p>
          <p>.eus. How ?</p>
          <p>Cyniskus. How ? Why, just as, I suppose, the carpenter's <lb/>
            axe and auger work together, in some sort, for the crea­ <lb/>
            tion of the work: but no one would say that they are the <lb/>
            workman himself, nor the ship the work of the axe or the <lb/>
            auger, but of the shipwright. Analogously, then, Destiny <lb/>
            is she who acts as the shipwright in regard to each parti­ <lb/>
            cular, while you are, I presume, the axes and augers of <lb/>
            the Fates : and, as it seems, men ought to offer their sacri­ <lb/>
            fices to Destiny, and demand their good things from her; <lb/>
            whereas they approach you, honouring you with their <lb/>
            processions and sacrifices. And yet they would not do it <lb/>
            reasonably, even in honour of Destiny. For I don't <lb/>
            suppose it to be possible even for the Fates themselves to <lb/>
            change or upset anything of what has been originally de­ <lb/>
            creed respecting each several event. At all events, Atropos1 <lb/>
            would not tolerate it, if anyone were to turn back the <lb/>
            spindle, and undo the work of Klotho.</p>
          <p>Zeus. And do you, Cyniskus, now require that not even <lb/>
            the Fates be held in honour by men? Well, you seem to <lb/>
            have for your object to throw everything into confusion. <lb/>
            We, however, if for nothing else, should be justly honoured, <lb/>
            at least, for our giving out oracles and predicting every <lb/>
            particular thing which has been determined by the Fates.</p>
          <p>Cyniskus. Upon a survey of the whole matter, it is use­ <lb/>
            less, Zeus, for those to whom it is altogether impossible to <lb/>
            guard themselves against them, to foreknow events that are <lb/>
            to take place; unless you say this-that one who has <lb/>
            learned beforehand that he will have to die by an iron <lb/>
            spear-head, might be able to escape death by shutting him­ <lb/>
            self up. But that is impossible : for Fate will drag him <note type="footnote"> 1 .As her name implies, the irreversible one, " with whom is no vari­ <lb/>
            ableness, neither shadow of turning." </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="220"/>
            out to set him hunting, and will deliver him up to the <lb/>
            spear; and an Adrastus will hurl his javelin against the <lb/>
            wild boar, and will miss him, but will slay the son of <lb/>
            Kroesus ; just as though the javelin had been carried <lb/>
            against the youth by irresistible command of the Fates. <lb/>
            The saying of Laius is, indeed, ridiculous, which says :­ <lb/>
            " Sow not, in heav'n's despite, a field of sons : <lb/>
            Sure death you'll meet from your own progeny."1 <lb/>
            For an exhortatory warning against events that will cer­ <lb/>
            tainly so happen is, I imagine, superfluous. So, in fact, <lb/>
            after the oracle, he did "sow," and the progeny" slew <lb/>
            him. Therefore, I don't see upon what pretence you demand <lb/>
            pay for your oracular art. Why, I omit to mention that <lb/>
            you Gods are accustomed to return to the majority of <lb/>
            your clients oracular responses of double and ambiguous <lb/>
            meaning, and don't make it over clear, whether the one <lb/>
            who crosses the Halys will destroy his own kingdom, or <lb/>
            that of Cyrus:2 for the oracle might be made to mean <lb/>
            both.</p>
          <p>Zeus. Apollo, Cyniskus, had some cause for anger against <lb/>
            Krcesus, inasmuch as he tempted him by boiling lamb's <lb/>
            flesh and a tortoise together.3</p>
          <p>Cyniskus. As a God, he ought not even to have been angry: <lb/>
            but, however, it had been fated, I presume, for the Lydian <lb/>
            that he should be deceived by the oracle; and, besides, <lb/>
            Destiny spun for him, that he should not understand too <lb/>
            clearly what was in store for him. So even your oracular <lb/>
            art is her work.</p>
          <p>.eus. And do you leave nothing for us, but are we Gods <lb/>
            without any purpose, and do we not import any sort of <lb/>
            providence into human affairs, and are we, like a lot of axes <lb/>
            and augers, in actual fact, unworthy of sacrifices ? Indeed, <lb/>

            silent, Zeus ? Or is it not lawful and right for me to <lb/>

          <p>Zeus. Why, no, Cyniskus; and you are a meddlesome <lb/>
            sort of fellow, and I don't know where you come from with <lb/>
            these jumbled-up arguments.</p>

            particularize-the wicked and the avaricious happy and <lb/>
            fortunate, the good driven and carried off into captivity, <lb/>
            oppressed through poverty, by diseases, and ten thousand <lb/>
            evils.</p>
          <p>Zeus. Why, don't you know, Cyniskus, what punish­ <lb/>
            ments the wicked endure after this life, or in how much <lb/>
            happiness the good pass their time ?</p>
          <p>Cyniskus. You talk tome of Hades, and the Tityuses and <lb/>
            Tantaluses. But, as far as I am concerned, whether there <lb/>
            is anything at all of the sort I shall know clearly enough <lb/>
            when I am dead: and, as for the present, I would prefer <lb/>
            to pass my life happily during this life, as long as it might <lb/>
            be, and, after death, to have my liver gnawed by sixteen <lb/>
            vultures-but not, while here, to be as thirsty as Tantalus ; <lb/>
            and in the Islands of the Blessed to drink, reclining in the <lb/>
            Elysian meadows with the heroes.3</p>
          <p>Zeus. What do you say ? Do you disbelieve or doubt <lb/>
            that there are certain punishments and rewards, and a judg­ <lb/>
            ment-seat, where at length each one's life is inquired into ? <note type="footnote"> 1 Meidias, an Athenian plutocrat, is chiefly known as the enemy of <lb/>

          <p>Cyniskus. I hear that a certain Minos, a Kretan, acts as <lb/>
            judge in such matters; and answer me somewhat about <lb/>
            him, too : for he is said to be your son.</p>
          <p>Zeus. And why do you ask about him, Cyniscus ?</p>
          <p>Cyniskus. Whom does he punish chiefly ?</p>
          <p>Zeus. The wicked, of course, such as murderers and <lb/>
            temple robbers.</p>
          <p>Cyniskus. And whom does he despatch to the heroes ?</p>
          <p>Zeus. The good and holy, who have lived virtuously.</p>
          <p>Cyniskus. Why, Zeus ?</p>
          <p>Zeus. Because some deserve reward, others punishment.</p>
          <p>Cyniskus. And, if a man have done some dire action <lb/>
            unwittingly, does he deem him deserving, too, of being <lb/>
            punished ?</p>
          <p>Zeus. By no means.</p>
          <p>Cyniskus. Nor, I suppose, if a man does some good <lb/>
            action against his will, would he think it proper to reward <lb/>
            him either ?</p>
          <p>Zeus. Why, no, to be sure.</p>
          <p>Cyniskus. Then it befits him, Zeus, neither to punish <lb/>
            nor to reward anybody ?</p>
          <p>jeus. How, not anybody ?</p>
          <p>Cyniskus. Because we men do nothing of our own wills, <lb/>
            but are compelled by some inevitable necessity, if, at least, <lb/>
            those things are true which have been before admitted- <lb/>
            namely, that Fate is the cause of everything. In fact, if a <lb/>
            man commit a murder, she is the real murderess; and if <lb/>
            he rob a temple, he does what it has been ordered him to <lb/>
            do. So, if Minos intend to give just judgment, he will <lb/>
            punish Destiny instead of Sisyphus,1 and Fate instead of <lb/>
            Tantalus. For what wrong did they commit, since they <lb/>

            me to live a laborious and no enviable sort of existence, in <lb/>
            having such a quantity of public business ; and, as it <lb/>
            appears, they were born under a not altogether propitious <lb/>
            Destiny, even they. I, at all events, if choice were given <lb/>
            to me, would not exchange my own life with them, but <lb/>
            would pass through life still poorer than I am rather than <lb/>

            upon the argument concerning Destiny and Providence. <lb/>

          <p>[Zeus, to hush the loud murmurs and growing discontent <lb/>
            of the privileged classes of Olympus at the constant influx <lb/>
            of novi divi, which threatens altogether to swamp the <lb/>
            ancient orders of divinity, summons a General Assembly <lb/>
            for the purpose of taking measures to remedy the evil. <lb/>
            After proclamation by Hermes, by permission of the Pre­ <lb/>
            sident, Momus, the Censor, or Public Prosecutor, of <lb/>
            Olympus, again undertakes the not uncongenial task of <lb/>
            exposing the patent scandals flourishing in their midst. <lb/>
            He repeats his old complaints,2 and animadverts sarcastically <lb/>
            upon the scandal, that not only are mortal men deified, but <lb/>
            that they bring with them a whole train of disreputable <lb/>
            followers of low or hybrid origin, whom, surreptitiously, <lb/>
            they introduce into the haut monde, and, by corrupt arts, <lb/>
            contrive to get raised to the Olympian peerage; that these <lb/>
            dieux nouveaux insist upon an equal share, with the ancient <lb/>
            aristocracy, of the public feasts and sacrifices. Here the <lb/>
            President interposes, and calls upon the Public Prosecutor <lb/>
            to proceed from general to particular charges, and specify <lb/>
            names. Thus admonished, Momus particularizes the most <lb/>
            conspicuous scandals of this kind, and proceeds (in spite <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">θεω̃ν Έκκλησία</foreign>—the " Popular Assembly of the Gods ”—is the <lb/>

            sonages from his indictment) to insinuate that the case of <lb/>
            the “ king of Gods and men " himself is not unobnoxious <lb/>
            to severe criticism-in particular, in regard to certain <lb/>
            events in the island of Krete, the scene of his education <lb/>
            and (alleged) decease ; and his notorious amours with <lb/>
            certain terrestrial mistresses, which were at once hazardous <lb/>
            and ridiculous. He does not omit to descant upon a <lb/>
            number of other notorious scandals caused by the too free <lb/>
            conduct of other deities of either sex, in imitation of their <lb/>
            father and sovereign lord. At the urgent interposition <lb/>
            of Zeus, passing over the Ganymede scandal, he next <lb/>
            attacks the Oriental, and especially Egyptian, interlopers ; <lb/>
            and, again called to order, passes on to the various oracular <lb/>
            divinities, and their portentously-increasing number-in­ <lb/>
            stancing certain well-known athletes, who had received <lb/>
            the honours of divinity and immortality. One of the <lb/>
            results of this extension of the celestial franchise, accord­ <lb/>
            ing to the Censor, is the increase of perjury. Descending <lb/>
            rapidly to human concerns, he severely assails the new­ <lb/>
            fangled names bandied about in the logomachies, and <lb/>
            word-twisting of the " philosophers;" and has a fling at <lb/>
            the new fashion of deifying Nature and Destiny, &amp;c., which <lb/>
            threatens to divert the old-accustomed rich sacrifices from <lb/>
            Heaven to Earth. At this point of his oration, observing <lb/>
            signs of weariness from some, of hostility from others, <lb/>
            Momus brings his address to a somewhat abrupt close. <lb/>
            Leave having been given by the President, he then reads <lb/>
            the resolution.</p>
          <p>The Decree sets forth, in the approved (Attic) legal <lb/>
            forms, the principal cause of the convocation of the <lb/>
            Assembly—viz., the intrusion of spurious and barbarous <lb/>
            interlopers, the overcrowding of Heaven, and the conse­ <lb/>
            quent alarming and extraordinary rise in the market­ <lb/>
            prices of their ambrosia and nectar, and the arrogance <lb/>
            and presumption of the dieux nouveaux. It announces the <lb/>
            meeting of the celestial Chambers in the approaching <lb/>
            winter, when an Inquisitorial Commission is to be ap­ <lb/>
            pointed for thorough revision and strict scrutiny of the <lb/>
            claims of the several more recent and surreptitious additions <lb/>
            to the theocracy; when they will be expected to produce <lb/>

            credentials, and proofs of the soundness of their claims : <lb/>
            the penalty of the flames of Tartarus to be enacted for all <lb/>
            who disobey the ruling of the Commission. Also, it is to <lb/>
            be within the powers of the same Commission to ascer­ <lb/>
            tain and curtail the present pluralities and patronage of <lb/>
            the various members of the ancien regime.</p>

          <p>Zeus. Have done with your muttering, Gods, and <lb/>
            don't crowd yourselves into corners, and take counsel <lb/>
            with one another in whispers, in your anger because <lb/>
            a number of unworthy guests share our table. But, inas­ <lb/>
            much as a Convention has been summoned to deliberate <lb/>

            thinks, and produce his charges. And you, Hermes, make <lb/>
            your proclamation according to the legal requirements.</p>
          <p>Hermes. Oyez ! Silence ! What God, of full age and <lb/>
            qualification, who has the right, desires to harangue ? <lb/>
            The subject of inquiry is respecting resident-aliens 1 and <lb/>
            strangers.</p>

            leave. So you will have no need of my permission.</p>

            manner-to whom it is not sufficient that they have been <lb/>
            themselves transformed from men into Gods, but, unless <lb/>

            forced to serve in the armies, but were not admitted to any sort of <lb/>

            plished no great or gallant achievement. Now I claim, <lb/>
            Zeus, from you the privilege of free speech, for otherwise <lb/>
            I could not venture upon it—but all know me, how <lb/>
            free I am of tongue, and that I could not be silent in regard <lb/>
            to any dishonourable action : for I examine everything <lb/>
            critically, and declare my opinions openly, neither fearing <lb/>
            anybody nor disguising my feeling out of mistaken modesty. <lb/>
            Thus I have the reputation with the large majority of <lb/>
            being a nuisance, and a calumnious character, and am <lb/>
            entitled by them a sort of public accuser. But, however, <lb/>
            as it is permitted to me, and has been so declared in <lb/>
            the crier's proclamation, and you, Zens, give me power to <lb/>
            speak out quite freely, I will speak without any sort of <lb/>
            reserve. Well, there are a considerable number, I affirm, <lb/>
            who, not content that they themselves participate in the <lb/>
            same councils with us, and take part in our banquets on <lb/>
            equal terms with ourselves-and that, though they are <lb/>
            half mortals—bring up their servants and Bacchanalian <lb/>
            hangers-on, into the bargain, into heaven, and enregister <lb/>
            them as Gods.1 And now they receive the distributions of <lb/>
            sacrificial meats on equal terms with us, and share in our <lb/>
            sacrifices, without even paying us the foreigners' tax.</p>
          <p>Zeus. Give us no riddles, Momus, but speak clearly and <lb/>
            explicitly, and supply us with the names of the accused. For <lb/>
            now your statement of the case has been recklessly brought <lb/>
            before the public, so that one guesses at a number of indi­ <lb/>
            viduals, and fits one individual to one and another individual <lb/>
            to another of your charges. You, who are a bold and inde­ <lb/>
            pendent speaker, ought not to shrink from saying anything <lb/>
            you have to say.</p>
          <p>Momus. Bravo, Zeus, for urging me to freedom of speech : <lb/>
            indeed, you act in this right royally, without mistake, and <lb/>
            magnanimously. So I will even out with the names. <lb/>

            daughter of a certain Syrophenician merchant, Kadmus), <lb/>
            ever since he was voted worthy of immortality, what sort of <lb/>
            character he has I say nothing-neither of his hair-fillet, <lb/>
            nor of his drunkenness, nor of his gait. For you all see, I <note type="footnote"> 1 See Z<foreign xml:lang="grc">εὺς</foreign> Tpay. </note> <lb/>

            suppose, how womanly and effeminate he is in disposition, <lb/>
            only half in his senses, reeking with the fumes of unmixed <lb/>
            wine from early morning. 1 He introduced among us a <lb/>
            whole tribe of his relations, and comes and brings his troop <lb/>
            of dancers, and makes Gods of Pan, and Silenus, and the <lb/>
            Satyrs, a set of rustics and goatherds, most of them, skittish <lb/>
            and goatish, and strange of form-of whom the one has horns, <lb/>
            and from the middle downwards, in fact, resembles his own <lb/>
            goat, and displays a long beard, and differs but little from <lb/>
            that animal; another is a bald old man, with a snub nose, <lb/>
            usually mounted upon an ass. He is Lydian.2 As for the <lb/>
            Satyrs, with their pointed ears, and bald heads, with horns, <lb/>
            such as grow on recently-born kids-they are by way of <lb/>
            being Phrygians. And they are even endowed, the whole lot <lb/>
            of them, with tails. You see what sort of divinities this <lb/>
            worthy finds for us. And, then, do we wonder that men have <lb/>
            contempt for us, when they see such ridiculous and pro­ <lb/>
            digious Gods ? I omit to mention that he brought up, too, a <lb/>

            whose crown, actually, he inserted in the circle of the stars ; <lb/>

          <p>Zeus. Don't say a word, Momus, either about Asklepius <lb/>
            or about Herakles—for I see what is the drift of your speech <lb/>
            -for as to them, one of them is a physician and cures men of <lb/>
            diseases, and hath “many fighters' value;”] while Herakles, <lb/>

          <p>Momus. I will hold my tongue for your sake, Zeus, <lb/>

            regard to yourself, I should have had much to say.</p>
          <p>Zeus. Indeed, you have, by all means, full leave to say <lb/>
            your say as far as I am concerned. But, surely, you are <lb/>
            not for bringing an action against me, too, as an alien for <lb/>
            usurping rights of citizenship ? 3</p>
          <p>Momus. In Krete, to tell the truth, not only is it possible <lb/>
            to hear this insinuation, but there is something, besides, <lb/>

              work you up when you are gold, and, in place of Zeus, you <lb/>
              might become either a necklace, or a bracelet, or an earring. <lb/>
              However it may be, you have filled Heaven, at all events, <lb/>
              with these semi-gods, for I cannot otherwise characterize <lb/>
              them. And the thing is most ridiculous, when someone <lb/>
              all on a sudden hears that a Herakles has been proclaimed <lb/>
              divine ; while Eurystheus, who imposed his orders upon <lb/>
              him, has died ; and a temple of Herakles, the servant, and <lb/>
              the tomb of Eurystbeus, his master, are adjoining. Again, <lb/>
              Dionysus is divine at Thebes; while his cousins, Pentheus, <lb/>
              and Aktæon, and Learchus1 were of all men most <lb/>
              miserable in their fate. From the first moment, Zeus, you <lb/>

              them only, but (what is most scandalous) the female also. <lb/>
              Who does not know about Anchises, and Tithonus, and <lb/>
              Endymion, and Iasion,2 and the rest ? So I think I will <lb/>

            him with his birth and family.3</p>
          <p>Momus. Then neither shall I say anything as to the eagle <lb/>
            -how it has taken up its abode in Heaven, and sits upon <lb/>

            For that, in fact, you do hear them in the discussions of the <lb/>

            deities, and claimed the first places for themselves, contrary <lb/>
            to all the traditions of our constitution, and wish to have <lb/>
            precedence even on the Earth. Be it, therefore, decreed <lb/>
            by the Senate and the People, that about the winter solstice <lb/>
            a popular Assembly be summoned on Olympus, and seven <lb/>
            of the first-class Gods be elected as Inquisitors-three from <lb/>
            the old Senate of the time of Kronos, and four from the <lb/>
            Twelve, of whom Zeus shall be one. Be it further enacted, <lb/>
            that these Inquisitors sit enpermanence, after having taken <lb/>
            the customary oath-by the Styx ; that Hermes make pro­ <lb/>
            clamation and assemble them all together, as many as put <lb/>
            in their claims, as tax-payers, to a seat in the Convention; <lb/>
            and that they bring with them sworn witnesses under oath, <lb/>
            and proofs of their birth and family. Thereupon let them <lb/>
            appear severally, and the Inquisitors, after close scrutiny, <lb/>
            shall declare them to be bond fide Gods, or shall despatch <lb/>
            them down to their proper sepulchres, and their ancestral <lb/>
            vaults : And, be it enacted, if any one of the rejected Gods <lb/>
            once ejected by the Inquisitors, be caught in the act of <lb/>
            climbing into Heaven, that he shall be thrown into Tar­ <lb/>
            tarus. Further, be it enacted that each God employ himself <lb/>
            solely about his own proper business : that neither Athena <lb/>
            practise Medicine ; nor Asklepius trade in oracles ; nor <note type="footnote"> 1 '0 Z<foreign xml:lang="grc">εὺς ἐπυτάνενε, καὶ προήδρευε Ποσειδω̃ν, ἐπεστάτι 'Απόλλων</foreign>. For <lb/>

            out some one province—either be a prophet, a professor of <lb/>
            music, or a physician.</p>
          <p>Be it further decreed, that the philosophers be warned not <lb/>
            to invent empty names, nor talk nonsense about what they <lb/>
            don't know. And as regards the disfranchised Gods, who <lb/>

            their statues are to be thrown down, and the statue of Zeus, <lb/>

            temples, instead : That, as for those others, their State erect <lb/>

            once: for I know that the dissentients will be in the majority. <lb/>
            The Assembly is now dismissed. But, whenever Hermes <lb/>
            shall make proclamation, come each of you with clear <lb/>
            testimonials, and plain proofs of your titles—the father's <lb/>
            and mother's names, and whence, and how, he or she became <lb/>
            a divinity, his tribe, and wardsmen.3 As, in the case of <lb/>
            whoever shall not exhibit these, whether a claimant has a <lb/>
            big temple upon the Earth, and whether he is regarded <lb/>
            by men as divine, the Commission will not trouble them­ <lb/>

          </head>
          <p>[Charon, ready to set sail, awaits impatiently the ap­ <lb/>
            pearance of Hermes, who is behind time with his accus­ <lb/>
            tomed batch of ghosts; and gives vent to his vexation in <lb/>
            complaints to Klotho, his colleague. Presently, the Con­ <lb/>
            ductor of the Dead is seen approaching, heated and out of <lb/>
            breath, driving the ghosts before him. He accounts for <lb/>
            his delay by narrating the attempt to escape of one of his <lb/>
            convoy, the tyrant Megapenthes, and the difficulty of the <lb/>
            re-capture, which was effected only by the timely assistance <lb/>
            of the cynic Kyniskus (a fellow-ghost) ; and the fugitive <lb/>
            tyrant now appears on the scene securely fettered.</p>
          <p>Before setting sail for Hades, Klotho receives from <lb/>
            Hermes, and enters on his way-bill, the names, nationality, <lb/>
            and manner of death of the various passengers. The cynic <lb/>
            philosopher complains that she has unfairly neglected him ; <lb/>
            and declares that he had long been intending to anticipate <lb/>
            her decree. In contrast to the disciple of Antisthenes, <lb/>
            the tyrant begs long and vehemently for respite, however <lb/>
            brief, on various pretences, all of which are sternly rejected, <lb/>
            by the Fate. In the end, he is forcibly carried on board <lb/>
            by Hermes and Charon, aided by the Cynic, and bound to <lb/>
            the mast. At this stage, the cobbler, Mykillus, comes <lb/>
            forward to expostulate with Klotho yet more strongly at <lb/>
            her long neglect of him, and, to her expressions of astonish­ <lb/>
            ment at his eagerness to embark, he replies by narrating, <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Κατάπλους ἢ Τυράννος</foreign>. Strictly, " The Putting-in, or Arrival of the <lb/>
            Ferry-Boat," etc. For the sake of brevity, the usual title has been <lb/>
            adopted here. The opening scene, it is highly probable, was suggested <lb/>
            to Lucian by some graphic picture. </note> <lb/>

            at considerable length, his reasons for not shunning Cha­ <lb/>
            ron's boat; and, at the same time, confesses his previous <lb/>
            illusions in regard to the imagined happiness of the despot, <lb/>
            Megapenthes.</p>
          <p>Klotho now gives orders for weighing anchor; when the <lb/>
            cobbler, finding that he was to be left behind until the <lb/>
            next day, owing to the crowded state of the boat, struggles <lb/>
            hard to get on board, and, failing in the attempt, jumps <lb/>
            into the Styx, to get across by swimming. He is, then, <lb/>
            perforce, taken into the boat-a place being found for him <lb/>
            on the shoulders of the tyrant-which proceeds on its <lb/>
            voyage: while Kyniskus, like the cobbler afterwards on <lb/>
            landing, declares his inability to pay the small coin required <lb/>
            as the fare, and earns his passage by taking an oar.</p>
          <p>The tedium of the rest of the voyage he relieves by <lb/>
            giving the " time " to his fellow-rowers, to the tune of some <lb/>
            popular sea-song, and in jeering at the lamentations of the <lb/>
            rich passengers, in which amusement he is joined by the <lb/>
            cobbler. Upon landing, the cynic and cobbler join com­ <lb/>
            pany, and proceed arm in arm towards the tribunal of <lb/>
            Rhadamanthys. The Infernal Judge orders that the <lb/>
            various dead men be brought before him. The cynic at <lb/>
            once demands to be heard against the tyrant; and, after <lb/>
            previous satisfactory examination of himself, which results <lb/>
            in his receiving a passport for the Elysian Fields, he charges <lb/>
            Megapenthes with his foul deeds of cruelty and of debauchery. <lb/>
            That royal criminal is found to be covered with the stigmata <lb/>
            -the brand-mark, of his crimes and vices; and, to estab­ <lb/>
            lish the accusations of his principal accuser, the tyrant's <lb/>
            own lamp and bed are brought forward as witnesses. At <lb/>
            the suggestion of his accuser, Megapenthes, in place of <lb/>
            being consigned to the flames of Pyriphlegethon, is pro­ <lb/>
            hibited from drinking of the waters of Lethe; and his <lb/>
            punishment in Tartarus consists in an ever-present recol­ <lb/>
            lection of his evil deeds. In accordance with the terms of <lb/>
            his sentence, he is now dragged away by the Erinyes, and <lb/>
            chained by the side of another royal criminal, Tantalus; <lb/>
            who, as a comparatively innocent offender, had some reason <lb/>
            to complain of this unexpected addition to his torture.]</p><pb n="239"/>

            <title type="sub">Charon, Klotho, Hermes, Megapenthes (a newly-deceased king), Kyniskus (a Cynic philosopher), Mykillus (a Cobbler), Rhadamanthys, Tisiphone, and a number of Dead Men.</title>

          <p>Charon (fretfully). Well, Klotho, this little craft of ours <lb/>
            long ago has been ready and excellently equipped for <lb/>
            putting to sea: for the bilge-water has been all baled out, <lb/>
            the mast has been hoisted, the sail spread, every one of the <lb/>
            oars supplied with its thong, and as far as I am concerned, <lb/>
            nothing prevents our hauling our little anchor aboard, and <lb/>
            proceeding on our voyage. But that Hermes is behind his <lb/>
            time, whereas he ought to have been here long since. Our <lb/>
            ferry-boat, therefore, as you see, has not a single passenger <lb/>
            on board, though it might have made the passage three <lb/>
            times to-day already. And it's close upon evening ;1 and <lb/>
            we have not yet turned over even a penny. And so, I know <lb/>
            very well Pluto will suspect me of laziness in the business ; <lb/>
            and that, though the blame lies with another. Our fine <lb/>
            honourable gentleman undertaker, like any mortal,2 has <lb/>
            himself drunk of the waters of Lethe,3 up yonder, and has <lb/>
            quite forgotten to return to us ; and, either he is wrestling <lb/>
            with his young men in the Palæstra, or playing his lyre, <lb/>
            or reciting some oration, and showing off his own silly <lb/>
            nonsense. Or, maybe, perhaps, the excellent gentleman <lb/>
            is practising his light-fingered art, and outwitting some <lb/>
            one—for that, too, is one of his accomplishments.4 And <lb/>
            so he takes his liberties with us, and that, while he half <lb/>
            belongs to our establishment.</p>

            Charon, whether some pressing business has not been im­ <lb/>
            posed on him, from Zeus wanting to use his services after <lb/>
            time, for some commission above ? He, too, is his lord and <lb/>
            master, you know.</p>
          <p>Charon. But not, Klotho, to make despotic use beyond <lb/>
            all fairness of a common possession ; for, we never have <lb/>
            detained him when he had to be off. But I know the <lb/>
            reason. We have only asphodel,l and libations, and cakes, <lb/>
            and the offerings to the dead; 2 and all the rest gloom, <lb/>
            and mist, and darkness : while in heaven all is bright, and <lb/>
            they have large supplies of ambrosia, and abundance of <lb/>
            nectar. So I fancy it is pleasanter to linger with them : <lb/>
            indeed, he takes wing from us to the upper regions, just as <lb/>
            if he were escaping from some prison. But when it is <lb/>
            time for him to come down to us, leisurely, and with slow <lb/>
            enough steps, and painfully he makes the descent at last.</p>
          <p>Klotho. Don't give way to your temper, Charon, any <lb/>
            longer : for here is the very person himself hard by, as <lb/>
            you see, bringing us a number of individuals; or rather <lb/>
            scaring them along en masse with his rod, for all the world <lb/>
            like a herd of goats. But what's this? I see one of them <lb/>
            handcuffed, and another grinning, and one individual with <lb/>
            a wallet suspended from his shoulder and with a club in his <lb/>
            hand, staring grimly at them, and urging on the rest. And <lb/>
            don't you see Hermes himself in a bath of perspiration, his <lb/>
            feet covered with dust, and all out of breath ? His mouth, <lb/>
            anyway, is a regular steam-engine?3—what's this, Hermes? <lb/>
            what's all this hurry about, for you seem to me to be a <lb/>

          <p>Hermes (puffing and perspiring). What else, Klotho, than <lb/>
            that, from chasing this runaway sinner here, I was within <lb/>
            an ace of being a deserter from my ship to-day ?</p>
          <p>Klotho. But who is he ? Or what was his intention in <lb/>
            running away ?</p>
          <p>Hermes. That's plain enough-he preferred living. He <lb/>
            is some king or despot-to judge, at least, by his lamenta­ <lb/>
            tions, and the wailings he gives vent to ; he says he has <lb/>
            been deprived of vast pleasure of some sort.</p>
          <p>Klotho. Then did the fool run away, as if he could have <lb/>
            a longer lease of life, when his spun out thread had actually <lb/>
            failed ?</p>
          <p>Hermes. Run away, do you say? Why, if this most ex­ <lb/>
            cellent gentleman here, he of the club, had not aided me, <lb/>
            and we had not caught and handcuffed him, he would even <lb/>
            have got clean off from us altogether. From the moment, <lb/>
            in fact, Atropos had delivered him over to me, all the way <lb/>
            he resisted and struggled ; and, firmly planting his feet on <lb/>
            the ground, he was by no means an easy charge. Sometimes, <lb/>
            too, he would fall to supplications and make vehement en­ <lb/>
            treaty, demanding to be let off for a little, with offers of <lb/>
            large bribes. However, I, as you may well imagine, did <lb/>
            not let him off, seeing that he wanted the impossible. <lb/>
            Well, when we were now at the very mouth of Orcus, <lb/>
            while, as was my custom, I was counting over the tale of <lb/>
            the dead to Æakus, and he was making up their reckoning <lb/>
            by the ticket sent him by your sister,1,somehow or other, <lb/>
            without being observed, the thrice-damned fellow got clean <lb/>
            away. One dead man, accordingly, was wanting to the full <lb/>
            tale; and, says Æakus, raising his eyebrows, " Pray, <lb/>
            Hermes, don't practise your thievish art with everyone <lb/>

            he comes from, and what the manner of his death. And <lb/>
            do you take them from me, and pack them together, and <lb/>
            arrange them in regular order. And do you, Hermes, first <lb/>
            of all, toss in those new-born infants there ; for what could <lb/>

            ought to have embarked at once.</p>
          <p>Megapenthes. One thing chokes me most of all, Klotho, <lb/>

          <p>Megapenthes. Karion, my domestic, as soon as ever he <lb/>
            perceived me to be dead, late at night went up into my <lb/>
            chamber, where I was lying—there being plenty of oppor­ <lb/>
            tunity, for there was no one even to watch over me—and, <lb/>
            fastening the door, enjoyed himself with my mistress Gly­ <lb/>

            made free with her 2), for all the world as though nobody <lb/>
            was there; then, when he had satisfied his desire, fixing <lb/>
            his looks upon me, " You, however, you little paltry <lb/>
            scoundrel of a fellow," exclaims he, many a time you <lb/>
            inflicted blows upon me for nothing," and, suiting his <lb/>
            actions to his words, he began to pull my beard, and strike <lb/>
            me on the chaps; and, finally, making a deep expectoration, <lb/>
            he spat on me, with the valediction of "Go to the devil," 3 <lb/>
            and took himself off. I was all on fire with rage, and yet <lb/>
            could not do anything to him, for I was already as dry as <lb/>
            a bone and cold as death; and the abominable girl, when <lb/>
            she heard the noise of some persons approaching, rubbed <lb/>
            her eyes with spittle, as though she had been crying over <lb/>

          <p>Mikyllus. Just lend me your ear, most excellent Fate. The <lb/>
            kind gift of the Kyklops does not altogether delight me—the <lb/>
            promise, I mean, of " Outis I will last devour." 2 Whether <lb/>
            first or last, the same teeth, I suppose, await me. Besides, my <lb/>
            circumstances are not like those of the rich-for our lives, <lb/>
            as the saying is, are " as opposite as the two poles." 3 The <lb/>
            prince, indeed, seeing he had the reputation of being <lb/>
            happy in life, an object of dread to all, and looked up to <lb/>
            with awe by everyone, and has left behind such a vast <lb/>
            amount of gold and silver, and fine clothes, and horses, and <lb/>
            dinners, and handsome boys, and beautiful women, was with <lb/>
            good reason angry, and vexed at being torn away from them <lb/>
            all. For, somehow or other, the mind clings to such things <lb/>
            as to a sort of bird-lime, and is not willing with any good <lb/>
            grace to let itself go, inasmuch as it has long been fast glued <lb/>
            to them; or, rather, it is as if it were some unseverable <lb/>

            should one drag them off by force, they will howl and fall <lb/>

            they are found out to be arrant cowards as respects this <lb/>
            road that leads to Hades. They turn themselves round, <lb/>
            forsooth, to regard what they are leaving behind ; and, like <lb/>

            estate, no house-property,1 no gold, no furniture, no fame, <lb/>
            no portraits, naturally I was quite equipped for the journey, <lb/>
            and when Atropos simply beckoned to me, gladly I threw <lb/>
            away my brad-awl, and shoe-sale-for I had a last in my <lb/>
            hands-and jumping up at once I followed barefooted, and <lb/>
            without even washing off the black dirt; rather I led the way, <lb/>
            with my face to the front: for there was nothing behind to <lb/>
            cause me to turn, and to call me back. And heaven be my <lb/>
            witness, now I see everything with you to be fair; for the <lb/>
            fact of perfect equality in honour for all, and of nobody being <lb/>
            superior to his neighbour, to me, at all events, appears to <lb/>
            be uncommonly pleasant. And I guess that debts are not <lb/>
            demanded of debtors hereabouts, and that there are no taxes <lb/>
            to pay. But what is best of all, is that there is no shivering <lb/>
            from winter's cold, nor sickness, nor being beaten by one's <lb/>
            superiors. All is perfect peace here, and things are entirely <lb/>
            reversed : for it's we poor devils now who laugh, while the <lb/>

          <p>Mikyllus. Just hear me, a moment, my most honoured <lb/>
            of all divinities. Up above there I used to live near <lb/>
            the palace of a prince, and very narrowly observed all his <lb/>
            actions, and he seemed to me then to be even, in a manner, <lb/>
            a rival of the gods. For when I saw his embroidered <lb/>
            purple, and the number of his attendants, and his gold, and <lb/>
            his bejewelled beakers, and his silver-footed couches, I <lb/>
            thought him happy; and, moreover, the rich steam from <lb/>
            the dishes prepared for his feasts tantalized me to death­ <lb/>
            so that he appeared quite plainly to me to be some man far <lb/>

            great man 1 was seen to be altogether an object for ridicule <lb/>

            derided myself the more, such a miserable wretch bad I <lb/>

            fortune by the steam from his kitchens, and thinking him <lb/>
            happy on account of the blood-red liquid obtained from <lb/>
            shell-fish in the seas of Lakonia. And, when I saw not <lb/>
            only him, but also the money-lender Gniphon, groaning <lb/>
            and repenting of his folly, because he had had no enjoyment <lb/>

            his wealth to the spendthrift Rhodocharis2 (for he was his <lb/>

            property), I did not know how to stifle my laughter; most <lb/>
            especially, when I remembered how pallid he always was, <lb/>
            and dirty, with his face full of care, and rich only for his <lb/>
            fingers, with which he used to count over his talents and <lb/>
            myriads of drachmas, scraping together little by little what <lb/>
            in a brief time will be squandered by the happy Rhodo­ <lb/>

            harvest of my vines, which I planted for myself last year ? 2</p>
          <p>Hermes. Mikyllus, don't you lament at all ? Upon my <lb/>
            word, it is not lawful and right for anyone to make the <lb/>
            passage without shedding a tear.</p>
          <p>Mikyllus. Get away with you. There's no reason why I <lb/>
            should bewail myself for having a pleasant voyage.</p>
          <p>Hermes. All the same, make some groaning, however little, <lb/>
            merely for the sake of conformity.</p>
          <p>Mikyllus. I will groan away then, since it's your wish, <lb/>
            Hermes.—Alas for my sandal-soles! 3 Alas for my old <lb/>
            lasts ! Oh ! oh ! oh! for my rotten shoes ! Never again, <lb/>
            poor wretch that I am, shall I go from morning to evening <lb/>
            without a morsel of food, nor in the cold winter shall I <lb/>
            wander about unshod and half-naked, chattering with my <lb/>
            teeth from cold. Who, I wonder, will have my knife and <lb/>
            my awl ?</p>

            though you had been born anew ?</p>
          <p>Kyniskus. I will tell you. Whereas formerly I was <lb/>
            corrupt for want of instruction, and, on that account, <lb/>
            contracted many brand-marks; as soon as ever I began to <lb/>

          <p>Hermes. Let Megapenthes, son of Lakydas, approach.- <lb/>
            Where are you wriggling to ? Step to the front at once. <lb/>

            accusations, and convict him on the spot: for the man is <lb/>
            at your elbow here.1</p>
          <p>Kyniskus. Indeed, there was no need of words at all: <lb/>
            for you will very quickly know him, from his brand-marks, <lb/>
            what sort of character he is. All the same, I will reveal the <lb/>

            still more plainly by my account. Well, all the actions <lb/>
            of this thrice-cursed wretch, as a private individual, I <lb/>
            intend to pass by. As soon as ever, by attaching to <lb/>
            himself the most shameless of men, and collecting a <lb/>
            body-guard, he had effected a coup-d'etat, and established <lb/>
            himself as despot, he put to death more than ten thousand <lb/>
            citizens untried; and, seizing upon the property of each <lb/>
            one of them, and so arriving at the highest pitch of wealth, <lb/>
            he has omitted no shape or form of excess. He exercised <lb/>
            every sort of cruelty, and insolence, and wrong against the <lb/>
            miserable citizens, violating virgins, and foully disgracing <lb/>
            youths, in every way grossly insulting his subjects2 in his <lb/>

            and some, because they were indignant at their sons being <lb/>
            carried off to be insulted by his unnatural debaucheries; <lb/>
            others, because they were rich; some, because they were <lb/>
            able, and prudent, and did not at all approve of his acts.</p>

            respects, Kyniskus has falsely accused me.</p>
          <p>Kyniskus. Then I will bring you witnesses of these <lb/>

          </head>
          <p>[MENIPPUS, the Cynic philosopher, just returned from a <lb/>
            visit of inquiry to Hades, meets his friend Philonides, who <lb/>
            earnestly begs him to reveal the reasons, and the experi­ <lb/>
            ences, of his interesting journey. Thus adjured, with some <lb/>
            display of reluctance, Menippus, after having been assured <lb/>
            by his friend that human life has not at all improved <lb/>
            during his absence, professes that he had been impelled to <lb/>
            take so hazardous a journey by an ardent desire to learn <lb/>
            the truths of philosophy and life-vainly sought alike in <lb/>
            the popular Theology and in the schools of the Philo­ <lb/>
            sophers, or Sophists, who were all at variance one with the <lb/>
            other, and contradicted themselves ; while they failed to <lb/>
            practise their own teaching.</p>
          <p>Thus forced to trust to his own resources, after much <lb/>
            mental inquietude, he determines to go to Babylon, a <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Μένιππος η̋ Νεκυομαντεία</foreign>. This Lucianic Dialogue (for its genuine­ <lb/>

            Odyssey, of which it is, in great part, a parody. It is a sort of epitome <lb/>
            of the Dialogues of the Dead and other writings of the great master, <lb/>

            occult science obtain admission to the Under-World, and, <lb/>
            like his prototype, Odysseus, consult the soul of the Theban <lb/>
            prophet Teiresias. Arrived at Babylon, Menippus intro­ <lb/>
            duces himself to one of these Magi, named Mithrobarzanes, <lb/>
            and, with considerable difficulty, obtains from him promise <lb/>
            of assistance. Under the tuition of the Magus, he enters <lb/>
            upon a course of purificatory and mystic rites, and a strict <lb/>
            dietetic regimen, until he is properly prepared for the <lb/>
            dreadful descent. Embarking on the Euphrates, they sail <lb/>
            to a certain secluded place, where they leave their boat, <lb/>
            and begin the prescribed infernal rites and sacrifices—still <lb/>
            faithfully following the authority of the poet of the Odyssey <lb/>
            -invoking Hekate, the Erinyes (or Furies), and all the <lb/>
            daemons. The Earth opens, and the various infernal sights <lb/>
            are revealed. Descending, with much difficulty, the travellers <lb/>
            secure places on board Charon's boat, already overladen <lb/>
            with dead men, who, for the most part, had received their <lb/>
            quietus in battle. The lion's skin, and mane of Herakles, <lb/>
            with which the Cynic had provided himself, secure for <lb/>
            them places on board, and a courteous reception from the <lb/>
            Ferryman of the Styx. Disembarking, with the Magus for <lb/>
            guide, Menippus makes his way, through "squealing" <lb/>
            ghosts, to the tribunal of Minos. There they see the various <lb/>
            punishments for crime and injustice administered, and a <lb/>
            novel sort of witnesses in the shadows of the accused. <lb/>
            Among those most severely punished appear the arrogant <lb/>
            Rich ; and Menippus does not lose his opportunity for <lb/>
            the exercise of his satirical faculty. Leaving the judgment- <lb/>
            seat of Minos, they proceed to the scenes of punishment, <lb/>
            and view the various instruments and infliction of torture.</p>
          <p>In the Acherusian plains, they verify the accounts of the <lb/>
            poet of the Odyssey, as to the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀμένηνα καρήνα</foreign>, and other <lb/>
            particulars. The <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἰσοτιμία</foreign> is found to be complete and in­ <lb/>
            dubitable. Thersites and Nireus, Irus and Alkinous, have <lb/>
            nothing whatever to distinguish them one from the other. <lb/>
            Under the influence of this spectacle, Menippus compares <lb/>
            human life to a gigantic public Procession, and to the <lb/>
            Stage, where the several constituents play their diverse <lb/>
            parts, for a short time, liable to extremest vicissitudes of <lb/>
            fortune. Mausolus, and other vain-glorious princes, with <lb/>
             <pb n="264"/>
            their " lying trophies " and inscriptions, in particular, fall <lb/>
            under the Cynic's satire; and the Earthly kings and <lb/>
            potentates who, in the Under-World, cut so abject and <lb/>
            inglorious a figure. As for Sokrates and Diogenes, they <lb/>
            still pursue their peculiar and favourite occupations. At <lb/>
            this point of his narrative, Menippus is reminded that he <lb/>
            has omitted to quote the solemn Decree against the Pluto­ <lb/>
            crats, passed by the Popular Assembly of Hades (to which <lb/>
            he had referred at the beginning of his report), the pur­ <lb/>
            port of which is the apportionment of a severe retribution.</p>
          <p>At the point of going back to the Upper-World, <lb/>
            Menippus approaches Teiresias, and begs him to reveal the <lb/>
            secret, which was the object of his descent. This the <lb/>
            prophet's ghost does with laconic brevity. The philo­ <lb/>
            sophers then return, by a short cut, to Earth, near to the <lb/>
            Cave of Trophonius.]</p>

            in simple prose, thus. What was your equipment ? What <lb/>

            it's not a pleasant sort of thing, nor is the road a usually <lb/>

            The spirit to consult there ofTeiresias the Theban." 3</p>
          <p>Philonides. Ah ! my good fellow, but you surely are off <lb/>
            your head: for otherwise you would not be thus declaiming <lb/>
            to your friends in metrical strain.</p>
          <p>Menippus. Don't be surprised, my friend, for having lately <lb/>
            been in the company of Euripides and Homer, somehow or <lb/>
            other I got stuffed full of their verses, and their measures <lb/>
            come to my lips, as it were, of their own accord. But, tell <lb/>
            me, how go things above on Earth, and what are they about <lb/>
            in the city?</p>
          <p>Philonides. Nothing new, but just what they used to do <lb/>
            before-they plunder, perjure themselves, extort interest <lb/>
            by hook or by crook, turn " an honest penny " in the most <lb/>
            sordid fashion.4</p>
          <p>Menippus. Poor wretches, and unfortunate devils ! They <lb/>

          <p>Menippus. Yes, so help me heaven ! and many of them : <lb/>

            nor to proclaim the ineffable secrets, for fear that someone <lb/>

            Rhadamanthys for impiety.</p>

            grudge a friend the narration of those events ; for you will <lb/>
            speak to one who knows how to hold his tongue, and, <lb/>
            moreover, to one who has been initiated.</p>
          <p>Menippus. You impose upon me a hard task, and not at <lb/>
            all a safe one. But, however, for your sake I must run <lb/>
            the risk. It is decreed, I say, that these millionaires and <lb/>
            plutocrats, and those who carefully keep their gold coin <lb/>
            shut up like Danae</p>
          <p>Philonides. Don't tell me the decrees before, my good <lb/>
            Sir, you have recounted that which I would with most <lb/>
            particular pleasure hear from you—what was your inten­ <lb/>
            tion in making the descent, and who was your guide on <lb/>
            the journey? Next, in regular order, what you saw, and <lb/>
            what you heard among them : for it is reasonable to sup­ <lb/>
            pose, surely, that you as a dilettante neglected nothing of <lb/>
            what was worth seeing or hearing.</p>
          <p>Menippus. I must even do you this service, for what can <lb/>
            one do, when a gentleman and a friend urges one ? Well, <lb/>
            then, I will recount to you, first of all, my design, and <lb/>
            whence I got the impulse to make the descent. Well, I, as <lb/>
            long as I was in my teens, when I listened to Homer and <lb/>
            Hesiod recounting the wars and seditions not only of the <lb/>
            demi-gods, but actually even of the Gods themselves before <lb/>
            now ; nay, further, even their adulteries, and violences, and <lb/>
            rapes and feuds, their expulsions of parents, and their <lb/>
            marriages with sisters-all this I used to consider to be <lb/>
            good and right, and I tickled my fancy in no ordinary <lb/>
            degree with it all. But when I began to arrive at <lb/>
            mature age, on the contrary, I then heard the laws en­ <lb/>
            joining the opposite to the poets,-not to commit adultery, <lb/>
            nor to engage in civil war, nor to rob with violence, I <lb/>
             <pb n="267"/>
            stood fixed in great doubt and perplexity, not knowing <lb/>
            where I should turn myself. For, neither could I ever <lb/>
            believe that the Gods committed adultery, and engaged in <lb/>
            fratricidal war, unless they held about these things, that <lb/>
            they were really honourable: nor that the legislators would <lb/>
            encourage the opposite to these practices, unless they sup­ <lb/>
            posed their prohibitions to be advantageous. And, when I <lb/>
            continued to be in doubt, I resolved to go to those whom <lb/>
            they call " philosophers," and put myself in their hands, <lb/>
            and pray them to use me as they wished, and to point out <lb/>
            to me some sure and simple way of life. With this dispo­ <lb/>
            sition, I say, I approached them ; and I did not know that <lb/>
            I was forcing myself, as the adage is, from the smoke into <lb/>
            the fire itself.1 For plainly, upon close examination, I found <lb/>
            among them ignorance in a very special degree, and doubt <lb/>
            and uncertainty greater than elsewhere; so that very quickly <lb/>
            they proved to me that the way of life of the ignorant and <lb/>
            common sort of people was golden in comparison. One of <lb/>
            them would exhort me, you maybe sure, to indulge my love <lb/>
            of pleasure in everything, and that only to pursue by all <lb/>
            means: for that that was the being " happy." Another, on <lb/>
            the contrary, exhorted me to be laborious about everything, <lb/>
            and to toil, and to restrain, and torture the body, dress in <lb/>
            rags, live in squalor, and to make myself a nuisance to <lb/>
            everybody else, and use vituperative language;2 perpetually <lb/>
            declaiming to me those universally known verses of Hesiod <lb/>
            about Virtue, and toil, and sweat, and the ascent to its <lb/>
            summit.3 Another would exhort me to contemn money and <note type="footnote"> 1 ’<foreign xml:lang="grc">Ες αὐτό</foreign> TO <foreign xml:lang="grc">πυ̃ρ ἐκ του̃ καπνο</foreign>p<foreign xml:lang="grc">υ̃</foreign>—Anglice, "from the frying-pan into <lb/>

              and cold at the same moment. Plainly, then, I was in <lb/>
              the same case with those who doze-one moment nodding <lb/>
              assent, at another throwing my head back in denial. But <lb/>
              still more unreasonable than this-by close observation, I <lb/>
              found these same people to follow a manner of life quite <lb/>
              contrary to their own precepts. Those, in fact, who urged <lb/>
              me to despise money, I observed to cling to it with the <lb/>
              firmest grasp, to be quarrelling about their usury, teaching <lb/>
              for pay,1 and ready to endure anything for it. And those <lb/>
              who were for rejecting fame, I found to be employed in all <lb/>
              their words and actions for its sole sake; and, further, while <lb/>
              accusing almost all the world of devotion to pleasure, to be, <lb/>
              in private, firmly attached to that alone.</p>
          <p>Deceived, then, in this expectation, I began to be yet <lb/>
            more disgusted; while I consoled myself, in some degree, <lb/>
            with the fact that I was a fool, and wandering about still <lb/>
            ignorant of Truth, in company with many others-learned <lb/>
            people, and very much famed for their knowledge : and, <lb/>
            as on one occasion, I was kept awake all night, on this <lb/>
            account, I determined upon going to Babylon to beg the <lb/>
            assistance of some one of their Magi, the disciples and suc­ <lb/>
            cessors of Zoroaster ; for I heard that by certain incanta­ <lb/>
            tions and mystic rites they open the gates of Hades, and <note type="footnote"> there is allusion to the Stoic metaphor of the Steep Hill of Virtue); <lb/>

            conduct down whomever they choose in safety, and bring <lb/>
            them back again. I considered, therefore, the best thing <lb/>
            to do was, to obtain for myself the means of descent from <lb/>
            some of these persons, and go to Teiresias the Bœotian, and <lb/>
            learn from him, as he is a prophet and a sage, what way of <lb/>
            life is the best, and the one which any right-thinking man <lb/>
            would choose for himself. And, in fact, jumping up there <lb/>
            and then, as quickly as I could, I made straight for <lb/>
            Babylon. Upon my arrival I take up my residence with <lb/>
            one of the Chaldæans, a learned man, and of preternatural <lb/>
            excellence in his art, with white hair, who grew a very <lb/>
            venerable beard. His name was Mithrobarzanes. After <lb/>
            praying and earnestly supplicating him, I obtained from <lb/>
            him with great difficulty the favour of conducting me <lb/>
            on the route-upon his own terms. This gentleman taking <lb/>
            me to his house, in the first place, for nine-and-twenty <lb/>
            days, beginning immediately from the new moon, made me <lb/>
            perform my lustrations, conducting me down, at the first <lb/>
            dawn of day, to the Euphrates, and addressing some long <lb/>
            speech to the rising sun, which I did not very well under­ <lb/>
            stand : for, like incompetent criers at the games, his <lb/>
            utterance was rapid and indistinct. However, he seemed <lb/>
            to be invoking certain dæmons. After the incantation, <lb/>
            when he had spit three times1 in my face, I returned home, <lb/>
            carefully avoiding the gaze of persons I met on the road. <lb/>
            Our food was hard-shelled fruits,2 our drink milk and honey <lb/>
            and water, and the water of the Choaspes;3 and our bed was <lb/>
            under the open sky, upon the grass. When there had been <lb/>
            sufficient dietetic preparation, about midnight he would lead <lb/>

            wounds-one in the leg, another in the head, a third <lb/>
            mutilated in some other part, having just come, as it <lb/>
            appeared to me, fresh from some war. However, the <lb/>

            trustworthy, inasmuch as they are always associated with, <lb/>
            and never separated from our bodies.2 Minos, however, after <lb/>
            careful examination, dismissed each of the criminals to the <lb/>
            place of the wicked, to undergo punishment proportioned to <lb/>
            his deeds. With especial severity did he treat those of them <lb/>

            power, and had demanded all but divine worship,3 from de­ <lb/>

            and because they did not choose to remember they were <lb/>

            taking our leave of the tribunal, we arrive at the place of <lb/>
            punishment. Here, my friend, many and pitiful indeed, were <lb/>
            the things to be heard and seen ;3 for, at the same time, was <lb/>
            heard the sound of scourges, and the wailing of those who <lb/>
            were being roasted in the fire, and instruments of torture, and <lb/>
            pillories, and wheels ; and the Chimæra tore them to pieces, <lb/>
            and Kerberus gnawed them. All were being punished <lb/>
            together, kings, slaves, viceroys, poor, rich, beggars; and <lb/>
            all repented them of the bad deeds they had committed. <lb/>
            Some of them we recognized at a glance-such of them <lb/>
            as had recently died. These began to envelop their per­ <lb/>

            they glanced at us, it was in a very slavish and fawning <lb/>
            way: and that, though they had been tyrannical and <lb/>
            supercilious, to an extent you cannot conceive. To the <lb/>
            poor, on the other hand, remission of half their sufferings <lb/>
            was granted ; and, after they had had an interval of respite, <lb/>
            their punishments were wont to be renewed. In fact, I <lb/>
            saw, too, those punishments famous in story—Ixion and <lb/>
            Sisyphus, and the Phrygian Tantalus in ill case, and the <lb/>
            earth-born Tityus, Herakles ! of what bulk; he covered, as <lb/>
            he lay, you may be sure a whole field's space.1 Passing these, <lb/>
            we enter the Acherusian Plain ;2 and we find there the demi- <lb/>
            gods, and the Heroines,3 and the rest of the crowd of the <lb/>
            Dead living according to their nationalities and tribes­ <lb/>
            some individuals of ancient aspect and musty, and, as <lb/>
            says Homer, a " feeble folk" 4 and others fresh and well­ <lb/>
            preserved, especially the Egyptians among them, on account <lb/>
            of the durableness of their preserving, salting, and pickling. <lb/>
            The distinguishing each individual, however, was, by no <lb/>
            means, at all easy; for all are as like one to another as <lb/>
            peas, when the bones have once been stripped bare. How­ <lb/>
            ever, with difficulty, and after a long time, by narrowly <lb/>
            inspecting them, we did recognize some of them. They were <lb/>
            lying one upon the other, shadowy, dimly seen, and obscure, <lb/>
            and no longer possessing anything of what are counted <lb/>
            beauties among us. I need not assure you, as there were <lb/>
            numerous skeletons lying in the same spot, all alike, and <lb/>
            with a sort of horrible and vacant stare, and showing their <lb/>
            gumless teeth, I began to be at a loss with myself how I <note type="footnote"> 1 So Milton's Satan <lb/>

          <p>So, of a truth, as I looked upon those things, human <lb/>
            life appeared to me t6 resemble a sort of long public pro­ <lb/>
            cession, and Fortune appeared to have the management of <lb/>
            and to arrange every particular, while she assigned to those <lb/>
            taking part in the Show various and variegated costumes. <lb/>
            One she would take, if so it chanced, and equip in royal <lb/>
            fashion, and put a tiara upon his head, and assign to him a <lb/>
            number of body-guards, and crown his head with the diadem. <lb/>
            Another she would clothe in the dress of a domestic. A <lb/>
            third individual she would decorate with beauty ; a fourth <lb/>
            she turned out ugly, deformed, and an object of ridicule; <lb/>
            for it is proper, I imagine, that the Show be composed <lb/>
            of all sorts and conditions of men. And frequently, even <lb/>
            in the midst of the procession, she would change the <lb/>
            costumes of some of its constituents, and not permit them to <lb/>
            go through with it to the end, as they had been first <lb/>
            arranged; but, changing the dress of a Kroesus, she com­ <lb/>
            pelled him to receive in exchange the dress of a domestic <lb/>
            and a captive: while a Mæandrius,2 who up to that time <lb/>
            had been among the slaves in the Show, she invested with <lb/>
            the despotic sovereignty of a Polykrates, and for some time <lb/>
            suffered him to use the dress. But, when the time for the <lb/>

            had the use of for a brief space. I suppose you have often <lb/>
            seen of such as are employed on the Stage, those tragic <lb/>
            actors, who, according to the requirements of the dramas, <lb/>
            become at one time Kroesus and, at another, Priam or <lb/>
            Agamemnon; and the same person, if chance so directs, <lb/>
            who imitated, a little before, very grandly the dress and bear­ <lb/>
            ing of a Kekrops or an Erechtheus, at the summons of the <lb/>
            poet, in a little while comes forward as a domestic. And <lb/>
            now, when the drama is at an end, each divesting himself of <lb/>
            that gold-embroidered garment, and laying aside his mask, <lb/>
            and descending from his tragic-boots, moves about in public <lb/>
            as a poor and humble individual, no longer Agamemnon, <lb/>
            the son of Atreus, nor Kreon, the son of Menœkeus, but <lb/>
            now called by his proper name, Polias,1 the son of Charikles, <lb/>
            of the borough of Sunion, or Satyrus, the son of Theo­ <lb/>

            it seemed to me, from his tomb as he was weighed down <lb/>
            from having such enormous weight of material pressing on <lb/>
            him.1 For, when Æakus, my friend, measures out for each his <lb/>
            place-and he gives at most not more than a foot2—he <lb/>
            must be content to lie contracted in a very moderate space. <lb/>
            But you would laugh, I think, much more, if you saw those <lb/>
            who were kings and viceroys with us acting the beggar <lb/>
            with them, and either selling salt herrings for want, or <lb/>
            teaching the rudiments of grammar, insulted by any <lb/>
            common person, and smitten on the cheek as if they were <lb/>
            the most despised of slaves. In fact, when I saw Philip <lb/>
            the Macedonian, I could not even contain myself. He was <lb/>
            pointed out to me in a corner, mending rotten shoes for a <lb/>
            pittance. Many others, too, one might see begging at the <lb/>

            of inquiring into transcendental subtleties, and searching <lb/>
            into final ends and causes, and rejecting with contempt <lb/>
            their learned sophisms and syllogisms, and deeming such <lb/>
            things mere trifling and nonsense, search diligently for this <lb/>
            one thing alone-how, making wise use of what you have, <lb/>
            you may pass by with a smile of contempt most opinions, <lb/>
            and pursue nothing with too serious aim." <lb/>
            So spake he, and back he coursed through Asphodelian meadows,2 <lb/>
            and I—for it was now evening-" Pray, come," say I, <note type="footnote"> 1 " The terrible one," an alias of Hekate or Persephone. Cf. Apollonius, <lb/>

            " Mithrobarzanes, why do we longer linger, and not <lb/>
            return again to life ? ” And to this rejoined he : " Courage, <lb/>
            Menippus; for I will show you a short and easy path." <lb/>
            And, in fact, be led me to a certain spot, darker and <lb/>
            murkier than the rest, pointing to a certain dim and faint <lb/>
            light in the distance flowing, as it were, through a chink. <lb/>
            "That," said he, "is the shrine of Trophonius, and from <lb/>

            Ascend, then, by this road, and immediately you will be <lb/>

            and, after taking leave of the Magus, with very much <lb/>
            difficulty I crept through the narrow mouth, and here I <lb/>
