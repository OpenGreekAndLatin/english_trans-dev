          </head>
          <p>ALCIPHRON was a Greek sophist, <lb/>
            and one of the most eminent of the <lb/>
            Greek epistolographers. We have no <lb/>
            direct information of any kind respect­ <lb/>
            ing his life or the age in which he <lb/>
            lived. Some assign him to the fifth <lb/>
            century A.D. ; others, to the period <lb/>
            between Lucian and Aristaenetus <lb/>
            (170-350 A.D.)&gt; while others again <lb/>
            are of opinion that he lived before <lb/>
            Lucian. The only circumstance that. <lb/>
            suggests anything in regard to the <lb/>
            period at which he lived is the fact <lb/>
            that, amongst the letters of Aristae­ <lb/>
            netus, there are two which passed be­ <lb/>
            tween Lucian and Alciphron; and, as <lb/>
            Aristaenetus is generally trustworthy, <lb/>
             <pb n="vi"/>
            we may infer that Alciphron was a <lb/>
            contemporary of Lucian, which is not <lb/>
            incompatible with the opinion, true or <lb/>
            false, that he imitated him.</p>
          <p>It cannot be proved that Alci­ <lb/>
            phron, any more than Aristaenetus, <lb/>
            was a real name. It is probable that <lb/>
            there was a well-known sophist of <lb/>
            that name in the second century A.D., <lb/>
            but it does not follow that he wrote <lb/>
            the letters.</p>
          <p>The letters, as we have them, are <lb/>
            divided into three books. Their ob­ <lb/>
            ject is to delineate the characters of <lb/>
            certain classes of persons by intro­ <lb/>
            ducing them as expressing their pe­ <lb/>
            culiar sentiments and opinions upon <lb/>
            subjects with which they are familiar. <lb/>
            For this purpose Alciphron chose <lb/>
            country people, fishermen, parasites, <lb/>
            and courtesans. All are made to ex­ <lb/>
            press themselves in most elegant and <lb/>
            graceful language, even where the <lb/>
             <pb n="vii"/>
            subjects are low and obscene. The <lb/>
            characters are thus to some extent <lb/>
            raised above the ordinary standard, <lb/>
            without any great violence being done <lb/>
            to the truth of the reality. The form <lb/>
            of these letters is very beautiful, and <lb/>
            the language in which they are written <lb/>
            is the purest Attic. The scene is, <lb/>
            with few exceptions, Athens and its <lb/>
            neighbourhood; the time, some period <lb/>
            after the reign of Alexander the <lb/>
            Great, as is clear from the letters of <lb/>
            the second book. The New Attic <lb/>
            comedy was the chief source from <lb/>
            which Alciphron derived his mate­ <lb/>
            rial, and the letters contain much <lb/>
            valuable information in regard to the <lb/>
            characters and manners he describes, <lb/>
            and the private life of the Athenians. <lb/>
            We come across some remarkably <lb/>
            modern touches, as the thimble-rigger <lb/>
            at the fair and the claqueurs at the <lb/>
            theatre. Alciphron perhaps imitated <lb/>
            I <lb/>
             <pb n="viii"/>
            Lucian in style; but the spirit in <lb/>
            which he treats his subjects is very <lb/>
            different, and far more refined.</p>
          <p>In the great majority of cases the <lb/>
            names in the headings of the letters, <lb/>
            which seem very clumsy in an English <lb/>
            dress, are fictitious, and are purposely <lb/>
            coined to express some characteristic <lb/>
            of the persons between whom they <lb/>
            are supposed to pass.</p>
          <p>In the volume of "Lucian" in this <lb/>
            series some account has been given <lb/>
            of the courtesans of Athens. It will <lb/>
            here be interesting to describe briefly <lb/>
            another curious class of personages, <lb/>
            the parasites-a word which has had <lb/>
            a remarkable history.</p>
          <p>, Originally, amongst the Greeks, <lb/>
            the parasites were persons who held <lb/>
            special functions. They had a right, <lb/>
            like the priests, to a certain portion <lb/>
            of the sacrificial victims, and their <lb/>
            particular duty was to look after <lb/>
            the storage and keep of the sacred <lb/>
             <pb n="ix"/>
            corn, hence their name. They en­ <lb/>
            joyed an honourable position, and <lb/>
            the Athenians resigned to them even <lb/>
            the management of the temples, which <lb/>
            gave them rank next to the priests.</p>
          <p>Soon, after the example of Apollo, <lb/>
            the richest citizens looked out for <lb/>
            witty table - companions, to amuse <lb/>
            them with jests, and flatter them in <lb/>
            proportion to their importance and <lb/>
            liberality. By degrees, however, these <lb/>
            parasites, lending themselves to ridi­ <lb/>
            cule, fell into discredit and contempt. <lb/>
            The name, diverted from its etymo­ <lb/>
            logical signification, was applied to <lb/>
            every haunter of the tables of the <lb/>
            rich, to every sponger for a free meal, <lb/>
            to every shameless flatterer who, in <lb/>
            order to satisfy the needs of his <lb/>
            stomach, consented to divert the <lb/>
            company and patiently endure the <lb/>
            insults which it pleased the master of <lb/>
            the house to heap upon him.</p>
          <p>At first this was by no means <lb/>
             <pb n="x"/>
            the case with all parasites. Gaiety, <lb/>
            audacity, liveliness, good humour, a <lb/>
            knowledge of the culinary art, and <lb/>
            sometimes even a certain amount <lb/>
            of independence lent an additional <lb/>
            charm to the members of the pro­ <lb/>
            fession. One of the most famous of <lb/>
            parasites was Philoxenus of Leucas, <lb/>
            of whom we read in Athenaeus. It <lb/>
            was his practice, whether at home or <lb/>
            abroad, after he had been to the bath, <lb/>
            to go round the houses of the prin­ <lb/>
            cipal citizens, followed by boys carry­ <lb/>
            ing in a basket oil, vinegar, fish-sauce, <lb/>
            and other condiments. After he had <lb/>
            made his choice, Philoxenus, who was <lb/>
            a great gourmand, entered without <lb/>
            ceremony, took his seat at table, and <lb/>
            did honour to the repast before him. <lb/>
            One day, at Ephesus, finding that <lb/>
            there was nothing left in the market, <lb/>
            he asked the reason. Being told <lb/>
            that everything had been bought up <lb/>
             <pb n="xi"/>
            for a wedding festival, he washed <lb/>
            and dressed himself, and deliberately <lb/>
            walked to the house of the bride­ <lb/>
            groom, by whom he was well re­ <lb/>
            ceived. He took his seat at table, <lb/>
            ate, drank, sang an epithalamium or <lb/>
            marriage - song, and delighted the <lb/>
            guests. " I hope you will dine here <lb/>
            to-morrow," said the host. " Yes," <lb/>
            answered Philoxenus, " if you lay <lb/>
            violent hands upon the market as you <lb/>
            have done to-day." " I wish I had <lb/>
            a crane's neck, he sometimes ex­ <lb/>
            claimed; " then I should be able to <lb/>
            relish the flavour of the food for a <lb/>
            longer time." Dionysius, the tyrant <lb/>
            of Syracuse, who knew that he was <lb/>
            very fond of fish, invited him to <lb/>
            dinner, and, while an enormous mullet <lb/>
            was set before himself, sent his guest <lb/>
            a very small one. Without being in <lb/>
            the least disconcerted, Philoxenus took <lb/>
            up the small fry, pretended to speak <lb/>
             <pb n="xii"/>
            to it, and put it close to his ear, as <lb/>
            if to hear its reply. "Well," said <lb/>
            Dionysius, somewhat annoyed, "what <lb/>
            is the matter?" "I was. asking him <lb/>
            certain information about the sea <lb/>
            which interests me; but he has been <lb/>
            caught too young: this is his excuse <lb/>
            for having nothing to tell me. The <lb/>
            fish in front of you, on the contrary, <lb/>
            is old enough to satisfy my curiosity." <lb/>
            Dionysius, pleased with the rejoinder, <lb/>
            sent on to him his own fish. To per­ <lb/>
            petuate his memory, Philoxenus com­ <lb/>
            posed a " Manual of Gastronomy," <lb/>
            which was held in great repute.</p>
          <p>Philoxenus, it must be admitted, <lb/>
            was a very favourable specimen of his <lb/>
            class. As a rule the parasites were <lb/>
            among the most abject and worthless <lb/>
            of men. " Selected for their profli­ <lb/>
            gacy, their impudence, or their wit, <lb/>
            they were admitted to the tables of <lb/>
            the wealthy, to promote licentious <lb/>
             <pb n="xiii"/>
            mirth. This being the case, it does <lb/>
            not seem at all unnatural that we <lb/>
            should at the same time find them <lb/>
            the friends and companions of the <lb/>
            courtesans. Such characters could <lb/>
            not but be mutually necessary to each <lb/>
            other. The courtesan solicited the <lb/>
            acquaintance of the parasite, that <lb/>
            she might the more easily obtain <lb/>
            and carry on intrigues with the rich <lb/>
            and dissipated. The parasite was <lb/>
            assiduous in his attention to the <lb/>
            courtesan, as procuring through her <lb/>
            means more easy access to his <lb/>
            patrons, and was probably rewarded <lb/>
            by them both, for the gratification <lb/>
            which he obtained of the vices of the <lb/>
            one and the avarice of the other."</p>
          <p>The name parasite first assumed <lb/>
            a dishonourable signification in the <lb/>
            works of the writers of the Middle <lb/>
            and New Comedy. The first who so <lb/>
            used it is said to have been Alexis. <lb/>
             <pb n="xiv"/>
            In the later comedians they are stock <lb/>
            characters, whose chief object was <lb/>
            to get a dinner without paying for <lb/>
            it. They are divided into different <lb/>
            classes. There were the <foreign xml:lang="grc">γελωτοοιοὶ</foreign>, <lb/>
            or jesters, who, in order to secure an <lb/>
            invitation, not only endeavoured to <lb/>
            amuse, but endured the grossest in­ <lb/>
            sults and personal ill-treatment (cf. <lb/>
            Book III., Letters 6, 7, 49). They <lb/>
            had notebooks, in which they kept a <lb/>
            collection of jokes ready for use. The <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">κόλακες</foreign>, or flatterers, endeavoured to <lb/>
            get invitations by playing upon the <lb/>
            vanity of their prospective patrons. <lb/>
            The <foreign xml:lang="grc">θεραπυτικοὶ</foreign>, or "officious" para­ <lb/>
            sites, tried to curry favour by ser­ <lb/>
            vices of the lowest and most de­ <lb/>
            grading character, which are detailed <lb/>
            in the sixth book of Athenaeus. <lb/>
            They haunted the markets, wrestling­ <lb/>
            schools, baths, and other public places <lb/>
            in search of patrons.</p><pb n="xv"/>
            
          <p>The Romans also had their para­ <lb/>
            sites. As the stern rigour of the Re­ <lb/>
            public relaxed and degenerated into <lb/>
            the splendour and dissipation of a <lb/>
            despotic government, the Roman <lb/>
            parasites became less respectable and <lb/>
            more profligate. But it does not <lb/>
            appear that in the most licentious <lb/>
            ages of the Empire they ever equalled <lb/>
            in meanness or in vice those worth­ <lb/>
            less characters described in such lively <lb/>
            colours by Athenaeus, Alciphron, and <lb/>
            the comic poets of Greece. Frequent <lb/>
            allusions to them are found in Horace, <lb/>
            Juvenal, Plautus, and particularly in <lb/>
            Terence.</p>
          <p>The latinized forms of the names <lb/>
            of Greek gods and goddesses (such as <lb/>
            Jupiter for Zeus) have been preserved <lb/>
            in the translation as being more <lb/>
            familiar, although, strictly speaking, <lb/>
            they cannot be regarded as correct.</p>

          <p>HAPPILY for us, the sea to-day is <lb/>
            smooth and calm again. The storm <lb/>
            lasted for three days: the north winds <lb/>
            blew violently from the headlands to­ <lb/>
            wards the open; the blackening sea grew <lb/>
            rough, the waters were white with foam; <lb/>
            the billows everywhere broke over each <lb/>
            other, some dashing against the rocks, <lb/>
            while others swelled and burst. It was <lb/>
            utterly impossible to work : we betook <lb/>
            ourselves to the huts on the bank, col­ <lb/>
            lected a few fragments of wood, the <lb/>
            remains of the oaks which had been <note type="footnote"> 1—2 </note> <pb n="-"/>

              felled by the ships' carpenters, and <lb/>
              lighted a fire to relieve the piercing <lb/>
              cold. At last the fourth day came, a <lb/>
              truly halcyon day, as we may conclude <lb/>
              from the clearness of the air, and brought <lb/>
              us wealth and fortune in abundance. For, <lb/>
              as soon as the sun rose, and its first <lb/>
              beams glittered on the sea, we quickly <lb/>
              launched our little bark, which had lately <lb/>
              been drawn up on land, and, putting <lb/>
              our nets aboard; set to work. We cast <lb/>
              them not far from land. Ha ! what an <lb/>
              enormous haul we made! The heavily­ <lb/>
              laden net, carried under water, almost <lb/>
              dragged down the corks with it. Imme­ <lb/>
              diately the fish salesmen gathered round, <lb/>
              with their yokes over their shoulders, from <lb/>
              which hung baskets on either side ; and, <lb/>
              having purchased our fish for money <lb/>
              down, hastened from Phalerum to the city. <lb/>
              We had enough to satisfy them all, and <lb/>
              besides, took back to our wives and chil­ <lb/>
              dren a quantity of small fry, enough to <lb/>
              keep them not only for one, but for several <lb/>
              days, if bad weather should come on. <pb n="3"/>

          <p>ALL our labour is in vain, Cyrton ! <lb/>
            By day we are scorched by the heat of <lb/>
            the sun, by night we explore the deep <lb/>
            by the light of torches, and yet, in the <lb/>
            words of the proverb, we are pouring <lb/>
            the contents of our pitchers into the <lb/>
            cask of the Danaides-so idle and useless <lb/>
            are our efforts ! We have not even sea <lb/>
            nettles or Pelorian mussels to fill our <lb/>
            belly; but the master collects both the fish <lb/>
            and the money. But all that he gets from <lb/>
            us is not enough for him : he -is con­ <lb/>
            tinually searching our little bark. Only <lb/>
            lately, when we sent the lad Hermon to <lb/>
            him from Munychia with the fish, he <lb/>
            ordered us to bring him some sponges <lb/>
            and sea-wool, which grows in fairly large <lb/>
            quantities in the pool of Eurynome. Be­ <lb/>
            fore he had finished giving these orders, <pb n="4"/>

              Hermon left his load of fishes, the boat, <lb/>
              and ourselves, and went off on a rowing- <lb/>
              boat, with some Rhodian dyers whose <lb/>
              acquaintance he had made. Thus the <lb/>
              master has to mourn the loss of a slave; <lb/>
              we, that of a true companion. <pb n="5"/>

          <p>HAPPY is he who lives on land! Hus­ <lb/>
            bandry involves no danger. With good <lb/>
            reason, then, do the Athenians name it <lb/>
            Aneisidora, because it bestows gifts, <lb/>
            whereby we live and enjoy health. The <lb/>
            sea is cruel, and a sailor's life is full of <lb/>
            perils. My judgment is right: I have <lb/>
            learnt this by experience and instruction. <lb/>
            I remember that, once, when I wanted to <lb/>
            sell some fish, I heard one of those <lb/>
            fellows who hang about the Painted <lb/>
            Porch, a bare-footed wretch with livid <lb/>
            features, reciting verses and declaiming <lb/>
            against the folly of sailors. He said that <lb/>
            the verses were written by a certain <lb/>
            Aratus, an astronomer. I cannot repeat <lb/>
            all that he said; but, as far as I remem­ <lb/>
            ber, one of the verses ran as follows:</p>
          <p>A thin partition keeps off destruction. <pb n="6"/>

              Why, then, wife, should we not be wise, <lb/>
              and, even though it be late, avoid a life <lb/>
              that is so near to death ? We have chil­ <lb/>
              dren; and, although our poverty prevents <lb/>
              us from leaving them anything con­ <lb/>
              siderable, we shall at least be able <lb/>
              to leave them in blessed ignorance of <lb/>
              the stormy waves and the dangers of <lb/>
              the deep. They will be brought up to <lb/>
              an agricultural life, and will enjoy a life <lb/>
              of security, untroubled by alarm.</p><pb n="7"/>

          <p>THERE is as much difference between <lb/>
            us, toilers on the sea, and those who live <lb/>
            in cities and villages, as there is between <lb/>
            sea and land. They either remain within <lb/>
            the gates and occupy themselves with <lb/>
            public affairs, or, devoting themselves to <lb/>
            agriculture, wait quietly for the crops that <lb/>
            are their support; but we, whose life is <lb/>
            spent upon the water, find land death <lb/>
            to us, even as the fishes, who are unable <lb/>
            to breathe the air. Whatever, then, is <lb/>
            the matter with you, my dear Tritonis, <lb/>
            that you leave the shore and your yarn, <lb/>
            and are constantly running into the city, <lb/>
            visiting the Oschophoria and Lenaea in <lb/>
            the company of wealthy Athenian ladies? <lb/>
            This shows a want of prudence and <lb/>
            modesty. It was not for this purpose <lb/>

            recently a lucky cast brought you in a <lb/>
            quantity of golden darics, probably a relic <lb/>
            of the battle of Salamis. Perhaps a <lb/>
            Persian ship went to the bottom there <lb/>
            with the crew and all the treasures on <lb/>

            you did not marry an outcast or one of <lb/>
            the common herd, but the daughter of <lb/>
            respectable parents. Sosthenes of Stiria <lb/>
            was my father : Damophile, my mother. <lb/>

            you neglect me and our children, Galene <lb/>

            All my affairs go wrong, and, as the <lb/>
            proverb says, after the fashion of Man­ <lb/>
            drabulus. It is a sorry comfort to be <lb/>
            always buying and selling the necessaries <lb/>
            of life for worthless bits of money! It <lb/>

            you shall share the fruits of my labours <lb/>
            on the sea. I want, through your recom­ <lb/>

            Erasicles of Sphettus or Philostratus of <lb/>
            Cholargus, that I may take my baskets <lb/>
            of fish to them in person. By this <lb/>
            means, in addition to the price of the <lb/>
            fish, I hope through your interest to get <lb/>
            some trifle at their house on the day of <lb/>

          <p>THE surface of the ocean, as you see, <lb/>
            is already rough ; a thick mist has over­ <lb/>
            spread the heavens; the sky is everywhere <lb/>
            covered with clouds. The winds, driven <lb/>
            together, threaten every moment to disturb <lb/>
            the sea. The dolphins, leaping lightly <lb/>
            over the swelling waves, herald the ap­ <lb/>
            proach of stormy weather: those who are <lb/>
            skilled in astronomy say that Taurus is <lb/>
            rising in the heavens. Those who take <lb/>
            due precautions against dangers for the <lb/>
            most part come off uninjured; but there <lb/>
            are others who, from despair, abandon <lb/>
            themselves to the, waves of their own <lb/>
            free will, and leave the guidance of the <lb/>
            helm to chance. Hence we hear that <lb/>
            some are carried along by the current to <lb/>
            the promontory of Malea, and others to the <lb/>

              promontory of Caphareus is no better for <lb/>
              ships in stormy weather. Therefore, let <lb/>
              us wait until the sea is calm, and the <lb/>
              air has cleared, before we explore the <lb/>
              coast near this headland: perhaps we <lb/>
              may find a body thrown up, the remnant <lb/>
              of a shipwrecked crew, to which we may <lb/>
              pay the honours of burial. A good <lb/>
              action never misses its reward, even <lb/>
              though it does not follow immediately <lb/>
              upon the deed. The approval of the <lb/>
              conscience, in addition to the hope of <lb/>
              reward, supports and cheers the heart <lb/>
              exceedingly, especially when we do a <lb/>

          <p>HAVE you heard the important news, <lb/>
            Scopelus ? The Athenians are thinking of <lb/>
            sending a fleet to foreign parts, to carry <lb/>
            on a naval campaign. The Paralus and <lb/>
            Salaminia, the swiftest vessels afloat, lead­ <lb/>
            ing the way, are already unmoored, and <lb/>
            have taken on board the commissioners <lb/>
            who are to settle the time and starting- <lb/>
            point of the expedition. The rest of the <lb/>
            ships, which are to transport the troops, <lb/>
            require the services of a number of oars­ <lb/>
            men, who have had experience in con­ <lb/>
            tending with the winds and waves. What <lb/>
            are we to do then, my good friend ? <lb/>
            Shall we run away or stay ? Everywhere, <lb/>
            from Piraeus, Phalerum, and Sunium, as <lb/>
            far as the neighbourhood of Geraestus, they <lb/>
            are enlisting sailors. How should we be <lb/>

          <p>I DID not know how luxurious and <lb/>
            effeminate the sons of our wealthy Athe­ <lb/>
            nians were. But, lately, when Pamphilus <lb/>
            and some of his friends hired my skiff, <lb/>
            that they might go for a sail as the sea <lb/>
            was calm and take part in a fishing-ex­ <lb/>
            pedition, I learned what luxuries they <lb/>
            provided themselves with both on land <lb/>
            and sea. Finding the wooden seats in <lb/>
            the boat disagreeable, Pamphilus stretched <lb/>
            himself out upon some foreign carpets <lb/>
            and rugs, declaring that he could not lie <lb/>
            down upon the bare boards, which he <lb/>
            no doubt thought harder than stone. <lb/>
            He next asked us to make an awning <lb/>
            for him, by spreading out the linen sails <lb/>
            overhead, because he could not endure the <lb/>
            heat of the sun's rays: whereas not only we <lb/>

              wealthy, as a rule seek every oppor­ <lb/>
              tunity of warming ourselves in the sun; <lb/>
              for the sea and cold go together. Cer­ <lb/>
              tainly Pamphilus had not merely brought <lb/>
              his male friends, but he was accompanied <lb/>
              by a number of very pretty women, all <lb/>
              musicians. The name of one was Cruma­ <lb/>
              tium, who played on the flute; another, <lb/>
              Erato, was a harpist; and Euepes beat <lb/>
              the cymbals. Thus my bark was full of <lb/>
              music, the sea resounded. with song, <lb/>
              and mirth and gaiety prevailed. To me <lb/>
              alone this afforded no enjoyment. For <lb/>
              several of my fellows, especially the spite­ <lb/>
              ful Glaucias, with his jealousy, caused <lb/>
              me more uneasiness than a Telchinian. <lb/>
              However, the ample payment he gave me <lb/>
              cheered me; and now I am so fond of <lb/>
              these pleasure-parties on the sea, that <lb/>
              I wish I could find another of these <lb/>

          <p>I LATELY saw, on the beach at Su­ <lb/>
            nium, an old net torn and full of holes. I <lb/>
            asked whose it was, and why it was lying <lb/>
            there, as it had evidently not been broken <lb/>
            by too heavy a load, but its rents were <lb/>
            the result of age. I was told that it had <lb/>
            belonged to you four years ago; that it <lb/>
            had become entangled in a sunken reef, <lb/>
            and its meshes torn in the middle. It <lb/>
            appears that, since then, as you did not <lb/>
            care either to mend or take it away, it <lb/>
            has remained where it is, since none of <lb/>
            the neighbours ventured to touch it, as <lb/>
            they did not consider it belonged to them. <lb/>
            Thus, not only these people, but you, <lb/>
            the former owner, have abandoned your <lb/>
            rights of possession. I therefore ask you <lb/>
            to give me what is spoilt by age, and is <lb/>
            really no longer your property. You can, <lb/>
            without any loss to yourself, hand over <lb/>
            to me that which you have already <lb/>

          <p>You must be suffering from the effects <lb/>
            of high feeding, or else you are mad. I <lb/>
            hear that you are madly enamoured of a <lb/>
            singing-woman, and that, in paying ruinous <lb/>
            visits to her, you squander all your daily <lb/>
            profits. I have heard this from our ex­ <lb/>
            cellent neighbour Sosias, who has a great <lb/>
            respect for the truth, and would never <lb/>
            be betrayed into falsehood: I mean the <lb/>
            Sosias who is so skilful at - making that <lb/>
            excellent savoury broth from the little <lb/>
            fish which he snares in his nets. Tell <lb/>
            me, then, what has given you the idea <lb/>
            of music, of the diatonic, harmonic, <lb/>
            and chromatic styles, as he said, when <lb/>
            he informed me about it ? You are in <lb/>
            love both with the girl's beauty and her <lb/>
            music, as it seems. Leave off spending <lb/>

            It is quite impossible for me to give up this <lb/>

          <p>My hopes of the young Polycritus have <lb/>
            deceived me. I thought that, if his father <lb/>
            should die, he would spend his money <lb/>
            freely in feasting and all kinds of pleasure <lb/>
            with us and in the company of beautiful <lb/>
            women, and that he would have got rid <lb/>
            of all his fortune, or the greater part of <lb/>
            it, in this manner. Quite a mistake! <lb/>
            ever since his father Criton died, he <lb/>
            only takes one meal a day, and that <lb/>
            quite late, just before sunset. He eats <lb/>
            no expensive dishes, but common bread <lb/>
            from the market, and, when he wants to <lb/>
            have a regular feast, he adds some over-ripe <lb/>
            figs and half-rotten olives. Having been <lb/>
            thus deceived in my wonderful expecta­ <lb/>
            tions, I do not know what I am to do. <lb/>
            For, if the supporter himself needs some <lb/>
            one to support him, what is to become <lb/>
            of him who needs to be supported ? It is a <lb/>
            double misfortune for one hungry man to <lb/>

          <p>ONE of these cheese-cakes called after <lb/>
            Gelon of Sicily was set before us. The <lb/>
            very sight of it delighted me, and I was all <lb/>
            eagerness to devour it; but this moment <lb/>
            was put off for some time, for the cakes <lb/>
            were surrounded with all kinds of sweets, <lb/>
            made of pistachios, dates, and nuts out <lb/>
            of the shell. I regarded all this with an <lb/>
            unfriendly eye; and waited, with my <lb/>
            mouth wide open, until it should be time <lb/>
            to attack the cake. But the guests were <lb/>
            an unconscionably long time finishing the <lb/>
            sweetmeats, and the continual circulation <lb/>
            of the wine-cup caused further delay. At <lb/>
            last, as if it had been agreed to torture <lb/>

            clean his teeth with a piece of stick, <lb/>

          <p>I HAVE never experienced so severe a <lb/>
            winter in Attica. Not only did the winds, <lb/>
            blowing side by side or rather rushing to­ <lb/>
            gether in confusion, fall violently upon <lb/>
            us, but a steady fall of deep snow covered <lb/>
            the ground : it did not stop at the <lb/>
            surface, but rose to such a height, that, <lb/>
            when you opened the door, you could <lb/>
            hardly see the street that led to our <lb/>
            house. As you may imagine, I had <lb/>
            neither wood nor fuel, and the cold <lb/>
            pierced me to the very marrow. I then <lb/>
            bethought myself of a plan worthy of <lb/>
            Ulysses-to run to the vapour-rooms or <lb/>
            furnaces of the public baths. But even <lb/>
            there my fellow - labourers, who were <lb/>
            already assembled, refused to allow me <lb/>
            to enter, for we were all of us tormented <lb/>
            by the same goddess-Poverty. <pb n="36"/>

              As soon as I saw that there was no get­ <lb/>

              Having appeased the bath-keeper with a <lb/>
              couple of obols, I succeeded in warming <lb/>
              myself. After this, the snow was succeeded <lb/>
              by frost, the cold dried up the moisture, <lb/>
              and the stones on the roads became ice­ <lb/>
              bound. At last, the temperature became <lb/>
              milder, and the gentle sunbeams permitted <lb/>

          <p>SINCE the land does not sufficiently <lb/>

            shut himself up in a cell. The day of death <lb/>
            is fixed inevitably, and fate is unavoid­ <lb/>
            able. Life, therefore, does not depend <lb/>
            upon the profession which we choose: <lb/>
            it is subject to the arbitrament of fortune. <lb/>

            and moths. At first, he hardly spoke to <lb/>

          <p>MENANDER has made up his mind <lb/>
            to make a journey to Corinth, to see the <lb/>
            Isthmian games. I do not at all approve <lb/>
            of this idea. You know what it is to be <lb/>
            deprived of the company of a lover such <lb/>
            as he is, even for a little while; but I <lb/>
            had no right to try and dissuade him, <lb/>
            since he is hardly ever absent. He in­ <lb/>
            tends to stay in your town: I don't know <lb/>
            whether I ought to intrust him to your <lb/>
            care or not; for I know that he is <lb/>
            anxious to win your friendship, and this <lb/>
            certainly makes me somewhat jealous. I <lb/>
            am aware of our mutual friendship, but <lb/>
            I am afraid, my dear, not so much of <lb/>
            you-for I know that your character is <lb/>
            more honourable than your manner of <lb/>
            life-as of Menander. He is terribly <lb/>
            amorous, and, besides, even the gloomiest <pb n="44"/>

              charms of Bacchis. I do not feel at all <lb/>
              sure that he is not taking this journey <lb/>
              rather for the sake of making your. ac­ <lb/>
              quaintance than for the Olympian games. <lb/>
              Perhaps you will think me suspicious. My <lb/>
              dear friend, you must pardon the jealousy <lb/>
              which is so natural to us girls. It is <lb/>
              no trifle for me to lose a lover like <lb/>
              Menander; especially as, if any irritation <lb/>
              or quarrel should arise between us, I <lb/>
              should be obliged to put up with the <lb/>
              railleries and insults of a Chremes or <lb/>
              Diphilus on the stage. I shall be ex­ <lb/>

          <p>ALL we girls are grateful to you: <lb/>
            there is not one of us who is not as much <lb/>
            obliged as Phryne. Certainly she alone <lb/>
            was concerned in the dangerous action, <lb/>
            which that vile Euthias brought against <lb/>
            her, but the danger threatened us all <lb/>
            alike. For, if we are to ask our lovers <lb/>
            for presents in vain, or are to be accused <lb/>
            of impiety if we bestow our favours upon <lb/>
            generous clients, it will be better to <lb/>
            give up our present mode of life, and to <lb/>
            avoid exposing ourselves and others who <lb/>
            consort with us to annoyances on our ac­ <lb/>
            count. But now we shall no longer be <lb/>
            blamed on account of our profession, be­ <lb/>
            cause Euthias has shown himself a disloyal <lb/>
            lover; but, since Hyperides is just and <lb/>
            good, we shall continue it in the future <lb/>
            with increased zest. May your humanity <pb n="46"/>

          <p>THE sympathy which I felt for you in <lb/>
            your hour of danger, my dearest friend, <lb/>
            was not so great as is my present joy, now <lb/>
            that you have got rid of a worthless lover <lb/>
            and found an honest friend in Hyperides. <lb/>
            It is my opinion that this suit has been <lb/>
            very fortunate for you; for the trial has <lb/>
            made your name famous, not only in <lb/>
            Athens, but throughout the whole of <lb/>
            Greece. Euthias will be sufficiently pun­ <lb/>
            ished by the loss of your favours. Owing <lb/>
            to his natural stupidity, he appears to <lb/>
            have gone beyond the limits of the <lb/>
            jealousy of a lover in the excitement of <lb/>
            his anger; be assured that he loves you <lb/>
            at the present moment more than Hy­ <lb/>

              defence, and to gain your affection; but <lb/>
              the passion of the other has been only <lb/>
              more violently whetted by the loss of his <lb/>
              case. You may expect from him, then, <lb/>
              fresh entreaties, supplications, and pre­ <lb/>
              sents in abundance; but, my dear girl, <lb/>
              do not prejudice our cause, or, by listen­ <lb/>
              ing to the entreaties of Euthias, cause it <lb/>
              to be thought that Hyperides has done <lb/>
              wrong in taking our part. Neither believe <lb/>
              those who tell you that the orator's <lb/>
              efforts would have been unavailing, unless <lb/>
              you had rent your clothes and shown <lb/>
              your bare breasts to the judges. Why, <lb/>
              this very argument, so opportunely em­ <lb/>
              ployed, was the result of his exertions on <lb/>
              your behalf. <note type="footnote"> 7 </note></p><pb n="49"/>

            No doubt your object was to irritate <lb/>

            you have a lover who is admirably suited <lb/>

            you will soon see if he does not accuse <lb/>
            you of having tried to set fire to the dock­ <lb/>

          <p>I SHOULD never have believed that, <lb/>
            after so long an intimacy with Euxippe, <lb/>
            I should quarrel with her. I do not re­ <lb/>
            proach her with the many services I <lb/>
            have rendered her since she arrived here <lb/>
            from Samos. You know what a hand­ <lb/>
            some present Pamphilus offered me; but <lb/>
            I refused to have anything to do with <lb/>
            him, because I knew that he had already <lb/>
            become acquainted with her. By way <lb/>
            of rewarding my kindness handsomely, <lb/>
            she is endeavouring to curry favour with <lb/>
            that accursed woman Megara, of whom I <lb/>
            have long had my suspicions, on account <lb/>
            of Straton. So there is nothing astonish­ <lb/>
            ing in her speaking ill of me. It was <lb/>
            the festival of Ceres, and we were all <lb/>
            assembled according to custom at my <lb/>
            house, to spend the night. I was sur­ <pb n="51"/>

              priced at Euxippe's behaviour. At first, <lb/>
              she kept on giggling with Megara, and, by <lb/>
              mocking and mimicking me, showed her <lb/>
              spitefulness; then she began to sing aloud <lb/>
              some verses, containing allusions to a <lb/>
              lover who had forsaken me. I did not <lb/>
              mind this so much. But, at last, she <lb/>
              lost all decency, and ridiculed my dye <lb/>
              and rouge. She seems badly off herself: <lb/>
              I don't believe she even possesses a <lb/>
              mirror. For, if she saw how like yellow <lb/>
              ochre her complexion was, she would not <lb/>
              abuse me for being ugly. However, I care <lb/>
              very little about this. I want to please <lb/>
              my lovers, not monkeys like Megara or <lb/>
              Euxippe. I have told you this, that you <lb/>
              may not blame me afterwards; for, one <lb/>
              day, I will revenge myself upon them, <lb/>
              not with raillery or insult, but in such <lb/>
              a manner as to make them feel ■it. I <lb/>

              do. Compare, if you like, Aspasia the <lb/>
              courtesan and the famous sophist So­ <lb/>
              crates ; and consider which of them pro­ <lb/>
              duced the best citizens. You will find <lb/>
              that Pericles was the pupil of the former, <lb/>
              Critias of the latter. Abandon this folly, <lb/>
              shake off your disagreeable looks, my <lb/>
              darling Euthydemus: your beautiful eyes <lb/>
              were never intended to be scowling; re­ <lb/>
              turn to your lady-love the same as when <lb/>
              you used to visit her on the way from <lb/>
              the Lyceum, wiping off the perspiration. <lb/>
              Let us drink moderately, and prove to <lb/>
              each other that pleasure is the aim of <lb/>
              life. Then you will confess how learned <lb/>
              I am! Besides, the Deity only allows <lb/>
              us a short time to live; do not waste it <lb/>
              foolishly in trying to solve riddles. Fare­ <lb/>

          <p>IF you think it is any satisfaction to <lb/>
            you or that it adds to the gratification <lb/>
            of your clients, to make me come re­ <lb/>
            peatedly to your door and complain to <lb/>
            your servants who are sent to more <lb/>
            fortunate suitors, I cannot say you are <lb/>
            wrong in treating me thus contemptu­ <lb/>

            availing ; but be assured that few of <lb/>
            your favoured lovers would be so deeply <lb/>
            affected by the loss of your affection as <lb/>
            I am. I flattered myself that the quantity <lb/>
            of wine I drank yesterday at Euphemius's <lb/>
            would afford me some consolation, and <lb/>
            help me to drive away my nightly cares; <lb/>
            but it had just the contrary effect. It <lb/>
            only fanned more violently the flame of my <lb/>
            passion: I wept, I sobbed loudly, so that <lb/>
            the better disposed of those around me <pb n="56"/>

              laughed at me. There still remains for <lb/>
              me a slight alleviation of my sorrow, <lb/>
              a poor consolation, which, however, is <lb/>
              now withering away and fading. I mean <lb/>
              the flower which you plucked from your <lb/>
              head when we quarrelled at supper, and <lb/>
              threw at me, to show that you were not <lb/>
              offended with everything I had sent you. <lb/>
              But, if it amuses you, enjoy my grief; <lb/>
              if it please you, tell the story of it to <lb/>
              those who are now more fortunate than <lb/>
              myself; it will perhaps soon be their turn <lb/>
              to grieve, when they meet with similar <lb/>
              treatment. However, pray to Venus that <lb/>
              she be not angry with you for your pride. <lb/>
              Another would have written a letter to <lb/>
              you full of insults and threats: I prefer <lb/>
              to address you with prayers and suppli­ <lb/>
              cations, for I am desperately in love <lb/>
              with you. Alas ! in the excess of my <lb/>
              grief, I am afraid of imitating those un­ <lb/>
              fortunate lovers whose complaints only <lb/>
              serve to increase their misfortune. <note type="footnote"> 8 </note></p><pb n="57"/>

            could be supported on tears! I should live <lb/>
            right royally, for I know you would keep <lb/>

            as it is, unfortunately we want money, <lb/>
            clothes, ornaments, and servants. Our <lb/>
            arrangements depend entirely upon this. <lb/>
            I have no patrimony at Myrrhinus, no <lb/>
            share in the silver mines; I depend upon <lb/>
            the little presents I receive, and the <lb/>
            favours of foolish lovers, wrung only <lb/>
            from them with many sighs and tears. I <lb/>
            have known you now for more than a <lb/>
            year, and I am no better for it. My <lb/>
            hair is in disorder; it has not seen any <lb/>

              stick to you, I shall be able to find other <lb/>
              resources ? You weep ; be sure that won't <lb/>

              unless I can find a lover to give me <lb/>
              something. I wonder at your tears: how <lb/>
              absurd they are ! 0 lady Venus! You <lb/>
              say, Simalion, that you are madly in <lb/>
              love with a woman, and that you cannot <lb/>
              live without her. Well, my friend, have <lb/>
              you no valuable drinking-cups at home ? <lb/>
              has not your mother some jewellery ? <lb/>
              cannot you get some securities belonging <lb/>
              to your father ? Happy Philotis! the <lb/>
              Graces have looked upon her with kindly <lb/>
              eyes. What a lover she has in Mene­ <lb/>
              clides, who gives her something every <lb/>
              day. That is better than tears. As for <lb/>
              me, unhappy girl, I have no lover, but a <lb/>
              hired mourner, who sends me nothing <lb/>
              but roses and garlands, as if to decorate <lb/>
              an early grave for me, and declares that <lb/>
              he weeps all night. If you can give me <lb/>
              anything, come and see me, but-no <lb/>
              tears. Otherwise, keep your grief to <lb/>
              yourself, and do not worry me.</p><pb n="59"/>

          <p>DIPHILUS no longer cares for me; he <lb/>
            is altogether devoted to that dirty wretch <lb/>
            Thessale. Until the day of the festival of <lb/>
            Adonis, he used to come and sup and <lb/>
            sleep with me from time to time, but <lb/>
            since then he has put on an insolent and <lb/>
            haughty air, and wants to be made much of. <lb/>
            Whenever he was drunk, he was escorted <lb/>
            by Helix, who was very fond of coming <lb/>
            to stay at my house, since he was in love <lb/>
            with Herpyllis. But now he makes no <lb/>
            secret of it, that he does not intend to <lb/>
            have anything more to do with me. For <lb/>
            four whole days he has been on the drink <lb/>
            in Lysis's garden, in the company of <lb/>
            Thessale and that accursed Strongylion, <lb/>
            who, out of spite against me, has intro­ <lb/>
            duced this new flame to him. Letters, <lb/>

              efforts were fruitless and without result. <lb/>
              I even think they have increased his pride <lb/>
              and arrogance towards me. The only <lb/>
              thing that remains for me to do is to <lb/>
              shut my door against him, if ever he <lb/>
              wants to spend the night with me, in <lb/>
              order to vex her; insolence is generally <lb/>
              overcome by contempt. But, even if this <lb/>
              proves useless, then I must have recourse <lb/>
              to a more drastic remedy, as in cases of <lb/>
              severe illness; for it would be intolerable <lb/>
              not only to lose the money I get out of <lb/>
              him, but also to be Thessale's laughing- <lb/>
              stock. You say you have a love-potion, <lb/>
              which you have often tried upon young <lb/>
              men. I need some assistance of the kind <lb/>
              to cure him of his pride and fondness for <lb/>
              drink. I will send to make overtures <lb/>
              of peace and will try to soften him <lb/>
              with my tears. I will tell him he must <lb/>
              beware of the wrath of Nemesis, if he <lb/>
              slights a heart so affectionate as mine. <lb/>
              I will tell him other things of the same <lb/>
              kind, and draw freely on my imagination. <lb/>
              He will certainly come, moved to pity by <lb/>
              my great affection. He will even allow <pb n="61"/>

              and our old acquaintance in remembrance, <lb/>
              puffing himself up with pride, like the <lb/>
              wretch that he is. Helix also will help <lb/>
              me; Herpyllis will see to him. But the <lb/>
              effect of philtres is doubtful; they some­ <lb/>
              times prove fatal. But what do I care? <lb/>
              He must either live to be mine, or die <lb/>

            Bacchis is dead! She has left me nothing <lb/>
            but tears that will ever flow and the re­ <lb/>
            membrance of the sweetest love, that <lb/>
            continued delightful to the end. Never <lb/>
            shall I forget Bacchis: that moment will <lb/>
            never be. What sympathy she had for <lb/>
            all! One would be right in calling her <lb/>
            a living justification of the life of a <lb/>
            courtesan. I should think it an excellent <lb/>
            idea, if all the women assembled from <lb/>
            all parts and set up her statue in the <lb/>
            temple of Venus or the Graces. It is <lb/>
            a common reproach against such women <lb/>
            that they are wicked, faithless, greedy <lb/>
            after money: that their doors are always <lb/>
            open to anyone who will give them <lb/>
            money presents, and that they bring all <lb/>
            kinds of misfortunes upon their lovers. <lb/>

              able conduct protected ' her from the <lb/>
              general slander. You remember that <lb/>
              Mede who came from Syria with a nu­ <lb/>
              merous suite and great pomp ? He pro­ <lb/>
              mised her eunuchs, slaves, and Oriental <lb/>
              ornaments: but she rejected his advances. <lb/>
              She was content to share my humble * <lb/>
              cloak, and, satisfied with my trifling <lb/>
              presents, refused the gold and lavish <lb/>
              presents of the satrap. Do you re­ <lb/>
              member, also, how she rejected the <lb/>
              Egyptian merchant, who offered her un­ <lb/>
              told gold ? There was never a better <lb/>
              creature born; I am convinced of it. <lb/>
              Why, with all her good qualities, did <lb/>
              not Fortune guide her to a better choice ? <lb/>
              And now she is gone, she has left me, <lb/>
              and for the future will rest alone in the <lb/>
              grave ! How unjust, 0 kindly Fates ! <lb/>
              why am I not united with her in death, <lb/>
              as formerly in life ? But alas! I still <lb/>
              live, I eat my food, and hold converse <lb/>
              with my friends; but she will never look <lb/>

              now, how she spoke, how she looked! <lb/>
              what charms were in her words ! how <lb/>
              sweet and pure was the nectar that dis­ <lb/>
              tilled from her kisses ! It seems to me, <lb/>
              Persuasion sat upon her lips; girt with <lb/>
              the cestus, she went hand in hand with <lb/>
              Venus and the Graces. Now all the <lb/>
              ditties she used to sing as the wine went <lb/>
              round are over; the lyre, which she <lb/>
              smote with her ivory fingers, is silent : <lb/>
              she, who was the darling of all the <lb/>
              Graces, lies mute as a stone, mere dust <lb/>
              and ashes. And Megara, that fearful <lb/>

              mercilessly plundered Theagenes that, re­ <lb/>

              snatched up a miserable cloak and shield, <lb/>
              and gone off as a soldier; while Bacchis, <lb/>
              who adored her lover, is dead. I feel <lb/>
              easier, my dearest Euthycles, now that <lb/>
              I have poured my lament into your ears; <lb/>
              for it is delightful to me to speak and <lb/>

            bear to refuse to join your friends. You <lb/>
            have become modest, and are in love <lb/>
            with your admirer. Does such a repu­ <lb/>
            tation make you happy? Well, we are <lb/>
            only prostitutes and cannot control our <lb/>
            passions. But, patience; Philo also had <lb/>
            a staff of fig-tree wood: by the great <lb/>
            goddess, I am angry with you. We were <lb/>
            all present, Thessale, Myrrhine, Chrysium, <lb/>
            Euxippe; and Philumena, who has recently <lb/>
            married a jealous husband, put the worthy <note type="footnote"> 9-2 </note> <pb n="66"/>

              man to bed, and joined us, although she <lb/>
              came late. But you alone carefully guarded <lb/>
              your Adonis, lest, if you, his Venus, left <lb/>
              him, Proserpine might claim him for her <lb/>
              own. What a bout we had! how full of <lb/>
              enjoyment! for I see no reason to spare <lb/>
              your feelings. Songs, jests, drinking till <lb/>
              cock-crow, perfumes, garlands; sweetmeats. <lb/>
              The place where we sat down was shaded <lb/>
              with laurels: only one thing was wanting <lb/>
              -your company; nothing else. We have <lb/>
              often got drunk before, but rarely so <lb/>
              delightfully. But what afforded us the <lb/>
              greatest amusement was a serious dispute <lb/>
              between Thryallis and Myrrhine, as to <lb/>
              which of them could show the finest and <lb/>
              most. delicate buttocks. Myrrhine first <lb/>
              unloosed her girdle, and began to shake <lb/>
              her loins, which quivered through her <lb/>
              silken shift like fat or curdled milk, look­ <lb/>
              ing back complacently all the time at the <lb/>
              movements of her rump, then, moving <lb/>
              gently as if she were in the act, she <lb/>
              sighed, so that, by Venus, I was struck <lb/>
              with astonishment. Nor did Thryallis <lb/>
              shrink from the contest, but, eager to <pb n="67"/>

              surpass her in wantonness, said, " I will <lb/>
              not enter the lists with anything to cover <lb/>
              me, or with any affectation, but just like <lb/>
              the athletes at the games: the contest <lb/>
              admits of no shuffling." She stripped off <lb/>
              her shift, and, bending her loins upwards <lb/>
              a little, she said, " Look at the colour, <lb/>
              Myrrhine, how perfect it is, how pure, <lb/>
              how irreproachable! Look at my hips, <lb/>
              how they join the thighs, neither too <lb/>
              fleshy nor too lean, and the dimples at <lb/>
              their extremities." Then she showed her <lb/>
              loins, not trembling, like Myrrhine's, and, <lb/>
              with a smile, shook them with a quivering <lb/>
              motion, and whirled her buttocks round in <lb/>
              every direction so that they seemed like <lb/>
              running water. Then we all clapped our <lb/>
              hands and awarded the victory to Thry­ <lb/>
              allis. We also had other contests, and <lb/>
              compared each other's breasts; nobody, <lb/>
              however, ventured to dispute the palm <lb/>
              with Philumena, who has never had a <lb/>
              child and is plump and swelling. Having <lb/>
              spent the night in this way and abused <lb/>
              our lovers and prayed that we might find <lb/>
              others-for the latest fancy is always the <pb n="68"/>

              sweetest-we went away pretty well tipsy. <lb/>
              After many drunken freaks on the way, <lb/>
              we went to finish up at Deximachus's, . <lb/>
              in the Golden Alley, near the house of <lb/>
              Meniphron as you go down towards Agnus. <lb/>
              For Thais is desperately in love with <lb/>
              him, and with good reason, by Jove; for <lb/>
              the lad has just come in for a large for­ <lb/>
              tune from his father. We will pardon <lb/>
              you for your contemptuous treatment of <lb/>
              us. On the day of the festival of Adonis <lb/>
              we are going to have a feast at Colyttus <lb/>
              at the house of Thessale's lover: for it is <lb/>
              her turn to bedeck the lover of Venus. <lb/>
              We will pardon you, on condition that <lb/>
              you come and bring a dice-box and coral <lb/>
              image, and your pet Adonis; for we <lb/>

          <p>You are to blame for the liberty I <lb/>
            am taking; for you, though so mighty a <lb/>
            monarch, have allowed a courtesan to <lb/>

            accept my letters, after you have ac­ <lb/>
            cepted me. 0 my Lord Demetrius, when I <lb/>
            see you in public, and in the midst of your <lb/>
            body-guards and soldiers, and with the <lb/>
            ambassadors, wearing your diadem, by <lb/>
            Venus, I shudder and am afraid: I am <lb/>
            confounded and turn-my eyes away from <lb/>
            you, as from the blazing sun, lest your <lb/>
            splendour consume them: then in truth <lb/>
            you appear to me as Demetrius, the <lb/>
            besieger of cities.1 How fierce and war­ <lb/>
            like is your look! Then I can hardly <lb/>

              0 Lamia, *is this the man with whom <lb/>
              you sleep ? is this the man to whom <lb/>
              you sing and play all night ? is this the man <lb/>
              who has just written to you ? does he think <lb/>
              Gnathaena as beautiful as yourself? But <lb/>
              this does not grieve me: I silently utter <lb/>
              a prayer that I may see you at my house. <lb/>
              When you come, I adore you, and when <lb/>
              you take me to your arms and kiss me <lb/>
              fondly, I say to myself on the other hand: <lb/>
              Is this the besieger of cities ? is this the <lb/>
              man of war ? is this the terror of Macedo­ <lb/>
              nia, Greece, and Thrace ? By Venus, I will <lb/>
              take him by storm this day with my <lb/>
              pipes alone, and I will see how he will <lb/>
              treat me. Wait until the day after to- <lb/>
              morrow, and you shall sup with me. I <lb/>
              celebrate the feast of Venus every year, <lb/>
              and I do all I can to make each suc­ <lb/>
              ceeding feast surpass the last. I will <lb/>
              receive you lovingly and winningly, if <lb/>
              you assist me generously; for I have <lb/>
              committed no act that should make me <lb/>
              undeserving of your kindness since that <lb/>
              blessed night, although you gave me per­ <lb/>

              my person; but I have not. abused your <lb/>
              kindness, and I have had intercourse <lb/>
              with no one. I will not play the harlot, <lb/>
              nor, my Lord, will I lie, as others do; in <lb/>
              truth, by Diana! since that time but few <lb/>
              have sent me presents, in their awe of <lb/>
              the besieger of cities. 0 my King, Love <lb/>
              is swift to come and to fly away: when <lb/>
              in hope, he flutters his wings; when in <lb/>
              despair, he droops and sheds his feathers. <lb/>
              Wherefore it is a favourite trick of courte­ <lb/>
              sans to wheedle their lovers with hopes <lb/>
              of ever-deferred enjoyment, although with <lb/>
              a man like yourself there is no excuse <lb/>
              for delay, since there is no fear of your <lb/>
              being sated; we pretend to be ill, to be <lb/>
              busily engaged, to be singing, playing the <lb/>
              flute, dancing, preparing a supper, or <lb/>
              furnishing a house, by such means inter­ <lb/>
              rupting the fulfilment of their enjoyment, <lb/>
              which, unless we do this, soon becomes <lb/>
              insipid. The result is, that the hearts of <lb/>
              our lovers are more easily caught and <lb/>
              inflamed, since they are afraid that some <lb/>
              fresh obstacle may arise in the way of <lb/>
              their present fortune. In the case of others, <note type="footnote">10</note> <pb n="73"/>

              I might perhaps carefully practise these <lb/>
              arts; but towards you, who are so de­ <lb/>
              voted to me, that you publicly make a <lb/>
              show of me and delight in telling other <lb/>
              women that I excel them all, I could <lb/>
              not endure to be so deceitful. I am not <lb/>
              so silly : if I gave up everything, even my <lb/>
              life, to do you pleasure, I should consider <lb/>
              the sacrifice a trifling one. For I well <lb/>
              know that my preparations will be talked <lb/>
              about, not only in Therippidium's house, <lb/>
              where I intend to entertain you during <lb/>
              the feast of Venus, but throughout Athens; <lb/>
              yes, by Artemis, throughout the whole <lb/>
              extent of Greece. Above all, the hateful <lb/>
              Lacedaemonians, that they, who behaved <lb/>
              like foxes at Ephesus, may pretend to be <lb/>
              heroes, will not cease to abuse our ban­ <lb/>
              quet on the mountains of Taygetus and in <lb/>
              their solitary fastnesses, inveighing against <lb/>
              your humanity and kindness with the <lb/>
              severity of Lycurgus. But think no more <lb/>
              of them; remember to observe the day <lb/>
              of my banquet, and fix the hour yourself. <lb/>
              Whatever time suits you will be the <lb/>
              best. Farewell. <note type="footnote"> 10—2 </note></p><pb n="74"/>

          <p>No one is so hard to please, it seems <lb/>
            to me, as an old man who plays the <lb/>
            youth. How strangely this Epicurus <lb/>
            treats me, always finding fault, suspicious <lb/>
            of everything, sending me letters that I <lb/>
            cannot make out, even threatening to drive <lb/>
            me out of his garden. By Venus! if he <lb/>
            were an Adonis eighty years old, I could <lb/>
            not endure him, full of vermin as he is, and <lb/>
            always unwell, wrapped up in garments <lb/>
            of raw wool instead of felt. How long can <lb/>
            anyone endure a man like this philoso­ <lb/>
            pher ? Let him stick to his doctrines <lb/>
            about nature, and his perverted canons, <lb/>
            but let him allow me to enjoy my natural <lb/>
            freedom without his insults or annoy­ <lb/>
            ance. I have a regular besieger, Lamia, <lb/>
            but not one like your Demetrius. How <lb/>
            can one be patient with such a man ? <pb n="75"/>

              He tries to play the part of Socrates, to <lb/>
              imitate him in his mouthing and his <lb/>
              irony; he looks upon Pythocles as another <lb/>
              Alcibiades, and thinks to make of me <lb/>
              his Xantippe. I shall in the end be <lb/>
              obliged to remove from here, and will flee <lb/>
              from one country to another, rather than <lb/>
              put up with his incoherent letters. But <lb/>
              about the most monstrous and intolerable <lb/>
              thing that he has had the audacity to <lb/>
              do, I have written already to ask your ad­ <lb/>
              vice. You know the handsome Timarchus <lb/>
              from Cephisus: I do not deny that I have <lb/>
              been intimate with the young man for a <lb/>
              long time-it is only right to tell the <lb/>
              truth to you, Lamia-it is to him that <lb/>
              I owe almost my first acquaintance with <lb/>
              the goddess of Love, for he seduced me <lb/>
              when I lived in his neighbourhood. Ever <lb/>
              since then he has continually sent me <lb/>
              all kinds of presents, clothes, money, <lb/>
              Indian male and female slaves, and other <lb/>
              things, which I need not mention. In <lb/>
              the smallest trifles he anticipates the <lb/>
              seasons, that no one may taste their <lb/>
              delicacies before myself. Yet Epicurus <pb n="76"/>

              tells me to shut my door upon him, and <lb/>
              not let him come near me, calling him <lb/>
              by all sorts of names, which you would <lb/>
              not expect to hear from an Athenian or <lb/>
              a philosopher, but from some Cappado­ <lb/>
              cian on his first visit to Hellas. But, <lb/>
              if Athens were inhabited entirely by such <lb/>
              as Epicurus, by Diana! they could not, <lb/>
              in my estimation, be compared to Timar­ <lb/>
              chus's arm-no, not even to one of his <lb/>
              fingers. What do you think, Lamia ? <lb/>
              Is not what I say just and true ? Do <lb/>
              not ever imagine such a thing, I entreat <lb/>
              you by Venus. Yet this Epicurus is a <lb/>
              philosopher, a man of distinction, a man <lb/>
              who has many friends! Let him take <lb/>
              and keep and teach others: reputation <lb/>
              has no charms for me; but, 0 Ceres! <lb/>
              give me him whom I love—Timarchus. <lb/>
              All through me the youth has been <lb/>
              forced to leave the Lyceum, his youthful <lb/>
              pleasures, and the companionship of his <lb/>
              friends, and to live with Epicurus, to <lb/>
              flatter him, and to praise his windbag <lb/>
              doctrines. " No poaching on my pre-. <lb/>

              had not a far better right to say, " Do <lb/>
              you keep your hands off mine." But he, <lb/>
              although the younger, submits to an older <lb/>
              rival, while the other will not endure <lb/>
              him who has the juster claim. What <lb/>
              am I to do, Lamia ? Tell me, I beseech <lb/>
              you, by the gods ! By the sacred mys­ <lb/>
              teries, by my hopes of relief from my <lb/>
              misery, when I think of being separated <lb/>
              from Timarchus, I grow now cold, now <lb/>
              hot, in my extremities, and my heart <lb/>
              is quite upset. I beseech you, let me <lb/>
              come and stay with you for a few days, <lb/>
              and I will make him feel what blessings <lb/>
              he enjoyed when he had me in his house. <lb/>
              I am sure he cannot long endure my <lb/>
              contempt; he will soon send me one <lb/>
              messenger after another, Metrodorus, <lb/>
              Hermachus, and Polyaenus. How often <lb/>
              do you think I have said to him pri­ <lb/>
              vately, " What are you doing, Epicurus ? <lb/>
              Do you not know that Timocrates, the <lb/>
              son of Metrodorus, ridicules you for your <lb/>
              conduct in the assemblies, in the theatres, <lb/>

          <p>By the Eleusinian goddesses and their <lb/>
            mysteries, by which I have often sworn <lb/>
            in your company alone, dear Glycera, I <lb/>
            swear that, in making this declaration in <lb/>
            writing, I have no wish to exalt myself, <lb/>
            or to separate from you. For what <lb/>
            pleasure could I enjoy apart from you ? <lb/>
            in what could I take more pride than in <lb/>
            your friendship ? Thanks to your manners <lb/>
            and disposition, even extreme old age <lb/>
            shall seem youth to me. Let us be <lb/>
            young and old together, and, by the <lb/>
            gods, let us be together in death, under­ <lb/>
            standing that we die together, that jealousy <lb/>
            may not go down with either of us to the <lb/>
            grave, in case the survivor may enjoy <lb/>
            any other blessings. May it never be my <lb/>
            misfortune to see you die before me; <lb/>

              for me ? I am staying in Piraeus owing <lb/>
              to my ill-health; you know my usual ail­ <lb/>
              ments, which those who are not fond of <lb/>
              me call effeminacy and affectation. The <lb/>
              reasons which have induced me to write <lb/>
              to you, while you are staying in the city <lb/>
              for the sacred festival of Ceres, the Haloa, <lb/>
              are the following: I have received a letter <lb/>
              from Ptolemy, King of Egypt, in which <lb/>
              he entreats me, promising me right royally <lb/>
              all the good things of the earth, and <lb/>
              invites me to visit ~ him, together with <lb/>
              Philemon, to whom also, they say, a letter <lb/>
              has been sent. In fact, Philemon has <lb/>
              sent it on to me: it is to the same effect as <lb/>
              mine, but not so ceremonious or splendid <lb/>
              in the promises it holds out, since it is <lb/>
              not written to Menander. Let him con­ <lb/>
              sider and take counsel what he intends <lb/>
              to do; but I will not wait for his advice, <lb/>
              for you, my Glycera,. are my counsel, <lb/>
              my Areopagus, my Heliaea, yea, by <lb/>
              Minerva, you have ever been, and shall <lb/>
              ever be my all. So then I have sent <lb/>
              you the King's letter; but, to spare <lb/>
              you the double trouble of reading my <lb/>

              what answer I have decided to make to <lb/>
              it. By the twelve great gods, I could <lb/>
              not even think of setting sail for Egypt, <lb/>
              a kingdom so far remote from us; but, <lb/>
              not even if Egypt were in Aegina, close <lb/>
              at hand as it is, I could not even then <lb/>
              think of leaving my kingdom of your <lb/>
              friendship, and wandering alone in the <lb/>
              midst of the crowded inhabitants of <lb/>
              Egypt, looking upon a populous desert, <lb/>
              as it would seem to me without my <lb/>
              Glycera. I prefer your embraces, which <lb/>
              are sweeter and less dangerous than the <lb/>
              favours of all the kings and satraps. Loss <lb/>
              of liberty is loss of security; flattery is <lb/>
              contemptible: the favours of Fortune are <lb/>
              not to be trusted.</p>
          <p>I would not exchange for his Then­ <lb/>

            the Lenaea in the theatre, a banquet <lb/>

              riches ? And with whom am I to enjoy <lb/>
              it ? with Glycera separated from me by <lb/>
              so wide an expanse of sea ? Will not all <lb/>

              will not all these treasures be to me no <lb/>

              sorrows to the grave, and leave my <lb/>
              riches a prey to those who are ever on <lb/>
              the watch to seize them ? Is it so great <lb/>
              an honour to live with Ptolemy and his <lb/>
              satraps and others with like idle names, <lb/>
              whose friendship is not to be trusted, <lb/>
              and whose enmity is dangerous ? If <lb/>
              Glycera is angry with me, I clasp her in <lb/>
              my arms and snatch a kiss; if she is still <lb/>
              angry, I press her further, and, if she is <lb/>
              indignant, I shed tears; then she can no <lb/>
              longer resist my grief, but entreats me in <lb/>
              her turn; for she has neither eoldiers, <lb/>
              nor spearmen, nor body-guards, but I am <lb/>
              all in all to her. Is it so great and <lb/>
              wonderful a thing to see the noble Nile? <lb/>
              Are not the Euphrates, the Danube, the <lb/>
              Thermodon, the Tigris, the Halys, and <lb/>
              the Rhine equally deserving of admira­ <lb/>

              world, my life would be utterly swamped, <lb/>
              unless I saw my Glycera. And this <lb/>
              Nile, though a beautiful river, is full of <lb/>
              savage monsters; and it is impossible to <lb/>
              approach its streams, in which so many dan­ <lb/>

          </ab>
          <p>As soon as I received the King's <lb/>
            letter, I read it. By the glorious Mother, <lb/>
            in whose temple I now stand, I rejoiced <lb/>
            exceedingly, Menander, being mad with <lb/>
            joy, which I could not conceal from my <lb/>
            companions. There were with me my <lb/>
            mother, my sister Euphorium, and one <lb/>
            of my friends whom you know, who has <lb/>
            often supped with you, and whose Attic <lb/>
            dialect you so commended, but as if you <lb/>
            were half afraid to praise her, whenever I <lb/>
            smiled and kissed you more warmly. <lb/>
            Don't you remember, Menander dear? <lb/>
            When they saw my unwonted joy in my <lb/>
            face and my eyes, they asked me, " What <lb/>
            extraordinary good fortune has happened <lb/>
            to you, dear Glycera? You seem altered <lb/>
            in mind, in body, in everything. Joy <lb/>
            beams over your person ; cheerfulness <pb n="86"/>

              and happy contentment pervade your <lb/>
              whole being." I told them, raising my <lb/>
              voice and speaking louder, that all <lb/>
              who were present might hear me : <lb/>
              "Ptolemy, King of. Egypt, has invited <lb/>
              my Menander to visit him, and pro­ <lb/>
              mised him the half of his kingdom," <lb/>
              and, at the same time, in proof of this, <lb/>
              I shook triumphantly in the air the mis­ <lb/>
              sive bearing the royal seal. " Will you <lb/>
              be glad if he leaves you ? " they asked. <lb/>
              Most certainly, dear Menander, that was <lb/>
              not the reason, by all the goddesses. <lb/>
              Even if an ox were to speak, to use the <lb/>
              words of the proverb, I would never be­ <lb/>
              lieve that Menander would have the heart <lb/>
              to leave his Glycera in Athens and reign <lb/>
              alone in Egypt, in the midst of such <lb/>
              grandeur. It was clear to me, besides, <lb/>
              from the King's letter, which I read, <lb/>
              that he knew of our relations, and my <lb/>
              affection for you. It seemed to me that <lb/>
              he meant to banter you in a round- <lb/>
              about way with Egyptian witticisms. I <lb/>
              am delighted to think that the report of <lb/>
              our love has crossed the sea. The King, <pb n="87"/>

              from what he has been told, will see <lb/>
              the utter uselessness of wishing Athens <lb/>
              to be transported to Egypt. For what <lb/>
              would Athens be without Menander ? <lb/>
              What would Menander be without Gly­ <lb/>
              cera, who prepares his masks, puts on <lb/>
              his costumes for him, and stands at the <lb/>
              wings to give the signal for applause in <lb/>
              the theatre, and to accompany it with <lb/>
              her own ? Then, may Diana be my <lb/>
              witness! I tremble, then I breathe again, <lb/>
              and clasp you in my arms, the sacred <lb/>
              fount of comedy. Need I tell you the <lb/>
              reason of the joy I exhibited before my <lb/>
              friends ? It was simply the thought that <lb/>
              not Glycera alone, but even distant <lb/>
              monarchs love you, and that the fame <lb/>
              of your merits has extended across the <lb/>
              sea. Egypt, the Nile, the promontory <lb/>
              of Proteus, the tower of Pharos, are all <lb/>
              full of eager curiosity to behold Menander, <lb/>
              and to hear the conversations of the <lb/>
              misers, the lovers, the superstitious, the <lb/>
              faithless, the fathers, the slaves — in <lb/>

              who wish to see the author in person <lb/>
              will have to come to Athens to' me: here <lb/>
              they will be witnesses of my happiness <lb/>
              in the possession of a man whose renown <lb/>
              fills the universe, and who never quits <lb/>
              my side by day or night. However, if <lb/>
              the promised happiness which awaits you <lb/>
              there has charms for you—at any rate, <lb/>
              magnificent Egypt, with its pyramids, its <lb/>
              echoing statues, its famous labyrinth, and <lb/>
              the other marvels of antiquity and art- <lb/>
              I beg you, dear Menander, do not let <lb/>
              me stand in the way: this would make <lb/>
              me hated by the Athenians, who are <lb/>
              already reckoning the bushels of corn <lb/>
              which the King, out of regard for you, <lb/>
              will bestow upon them. Go, under the <lb/>
              protection of the gods and Fortune, with <lb/>
              a favourable wind, and may Jupiter be <lb/>
              propitious to you! As for me, I will <lb/>
              never leave you : do not expect ever to <lb/>
              hear me say that; and, even if I desired <lb/>
              to do so, it would be impossible for me. <lb/>
              I will leave my mother and sisters and <lb/>
              join you on board. I feel sure that I <note type="footnote"> 12 ­ </note> <pb n="89"/>

              shall soon turn out to be a good sailor. <lb/>
              If the motion of the oars affects you, <lb/>
              and the unpleasantness of sea-sickness, <lb/>
              I will tend and look after you. With­ <lb/>
              out any thread, I will guide you, like <lb/>
              another Ariadne, to Egypt; although <lb/>
              you certainly are not Bacchus himself, <lb/>
              but his attendant and priest. I have <lb/>
              no fear of being abandoned at Naxos, <lb/>
              to lament your perfidy in the midst of <lb/>
              the solitudes of ocean. What care I for <lb/>
              Theseus and the infidelities of the men <lb/>
              of ancient times ? No place can change <lb/>
              our affection, Athens, the Piraeus, or <lb/>
              Egypt. There is no country which will <lb/>
              not find our love unimpaired: even if we <lb/>
              had to live upon a rock, I know that <lb/>
              our affection would make it the seat of <lb/>
              love. I am convinced that you seek <lb/>
              neither money, nor opulence, nor luxury: <lb/>
              your happiness consists in the possession <lb/>
              of myself and the composition of come­ <lb/>
              dies ; but your kinsmen, your country, <lb/>
              your friends-all these, you know, have <lb/>
              many needs; they all wish to grow rich <lb/>
              and to heap up money. Whatever hap- <note type="footnote"> 12—2 </note> <pb n="90"/>

              pens, you will have nothing to reproach <lb/>
              me with, either great or small, of that <lb/>
              I am certain; for you have long felt the <lb/>
              deepest affection for me, and you have <lb/>
              now learnt to judge me aright. This, <lb/>
              dearest Menander, is a matter of re­ <lb/>
              joicing to me, for I always used to fear <lb/>
              the brief duration of a love founded upon <lb/>
              simple passion. Such a love, however <lb/>
              violent it may be, is always easily broken <lb/>
              up; but, if it be accompanied by reason, <lb/>
              the bonds of affection are drawn tighter, <lb/>
              it gains sure possession of its pleasures, <lb/>
              and leaves us free from care. Do you, <lb/>
              who have often guided me on several <lb/>
              occasions, tell me whether I am right in <lb/>
              this. But, even if you should not re­ <lb/>
              proach me, I should still have great fear <lb/>
              of those Athenian wasps, who would be <lb/>
              sure to buzz around me on all sides at <lb/>
              the moment of my departure, as if I <lb/>
              were taking away the wealth of Athens. <lb/>
              Wherefore, dear Menander, I beg you, <lb/>
              do not be in too great a hurry to reply <lb/>
              to the King; think it over a little longer; <lb/>
              wait until our meeting and we see our <pb n="91"/>

              friends Theophrastus and Epicurus; for <lb/>
              perhaps their opinion will be different. <lb/>
              Or rather, let us offer sacrifice, and see <lb/>
              what the entrails of the victims portend: <lb/>
              whether they advise us to set out for <lb/>
              Egypt or to stay here; and, since Apollo <lb/>
              is the god of our country, let us also <lb/>
              send messengers to Delphi, to consult <lb/>
              the oracle. Whether we go or whether <lb/>
              we stay, we shall always have an excuse <lb/>
              -the will of the gods.</p>
          <p>I have a better plan still. I know a <lb/>
            woman, very clever in all these matters, <lb/>
            who has just arrived from Phrygia. She <lb/>
            excels in the knowledge of the art of <lb/>
            divination, the stretching of the branches <lb/>
            of the broom, and the nightly evocation <lb/>
            of the shades. As I do not believe merely <lb/>
            in words, but require acts as well, I will <lb/>
            send to her; for she says she must per­ <lb/>
            form an initiatory lustration and prepare <lb/>
            certain animals for the sacrifice, as well <lb/>
            -as the male frankincense, the tall styrax, <lb/>
            the round cakes for the moon, and some <lb/>
            leaves of wild flowers. I think that you <lb/>
            have decided to come from the Piraeus; <pb n="92"/>

              if not, tell me how long you will be able <lb/>
              to exist without seeing Glycera, that I <lb/>
              may prepare this Phrygian and hasten <lb/>
              to you. But perhaps you have already <lb/>
              of your own accord considered with your­ <lb/>
              self how you may gradually forget the <lb/>
              Piraeus, your little estate, and Munychia. <lb/>
              I indeed can do and endure anything; <lb/>
              but you are not equally your own master, <lb/>
              since you are entirely wrapped up in me. <lb/>
              Even if kings summon you, I am more <lb/>
              your queen and mistress than them all, <lb/>
              and I consider you as a devoted lover <lb/>
              and a most diligent observer of your <lb/>
              oath. Therefore, my darling, try all the <lb/>
              more to come without delay to the city, <lb/>
              so that, in case you change your mind <lb/>
              in regard to visiting the King, you may <lb/>
              nevertheless have those plays ready which <lb/>
              are most likely to please Ptolemy and his <lb/>
              Bacchus, no ordinary one, as you know: <lb/>
              for instance, either the Thaises, the Misu­ <lb/>
              menos, the Thrasyleon, the Epitrepontes, <lb/>
              the Rhapizomene, or the Sicyonian. But <lb/>
              how rash and venturesome am I to take <lb/>
              upon myself to judge the compositions of <pb n="93"/>

              Menander-I, a woman who knows nothing <lb/>
              about such matters! But I have a clever <lb/>
              master in your affection, which has taught <lb/>
              me to understand even them; you have <lb/>
              shown me that any woman, who possesses <lb/>
              natural ability, quickly learns from those <lb/>
              she loves, and that love acts without <lb/>
              delay. I should be ashamed, by Diana, <lb/>
              if I were to show myself unworthy of <lb/>
              such a master by being slow to learn. <lb/>
              Anyhow, dear Menander, I entreat you <lb/>
              also to get ready that play in which you <lb/>
              have described myself, so that, even if <lb/>
              not present in person, I may sail by <lb/>
              proxy to the court of Ptolemy; so the <lb/>
              King will more clearly understand how <lb/>
              strong your love must be, since you take <lb/>
              with you at least the written history of <lb/>
              the same, although you leave behind you <lb/>
              in the city the living object of your <lb/>
              affections. But you shall not even leave <lb/>
              that behind; you may rest assured that <lb/>
              I shall practise myself in the mysteries <lb/>
              of guiding the helm and keeping look-out, <lb/>
              until you come to me from the Piraeus, <lb/>
              that I may safely guide you over the waves <pb n="94"/>

          <p>0 MOTHER, I am quite beside myself! <lb/>
            It is impossible for me to wed the young <lb/>
            Methymnaean, the pilot's son, to whom <lb/>
            my father lately betrothed me, since I <lb/>

            who carried the holy palm branch, when <lb/>
            you gave me permission to go to Athens <lb/>
            for the festival of the Oschophoria. Ah, <lb/>
            mother, how beautiful he is! how charm­ <lb/>
            ing! His locks are curlier than moss; <lb/>
            he laughs more pleasantly than the sea <lb/>
            in a calm; his eyes are azure, like the <lb/>
            ocean, when the first beams of the rising <lb/>
            sun glitter upon it. And his whole <lb/>

              after bathing in the fountain of Gargaphia, <lb/>
              had come to frolic around his cheeks. On <lb/>

          <p>RECENTLY there was an abundant <lb/>
            supply of fish; but, since my nets were <lb/>
            quite spoilt, I did not know what to do. <lb/>
            An inspiration came to me, which I <lb/>
            thought worthy of Sisyphus. I resolved <lb/>
            to go to the money-lender Chremes, and <lb/>
            to offer my boat to him as security for <lb/>
            four pieces of gold, that I might be able <lb/>
            to repair my nets. No sooner said than <lb/>
            done. Chremes, that skinny old wretch, <lb/>
            as a rule knits his brows and looks <lb/>
            savagely at everybody. Perhaps it was <lb/>
            the hope of getting possession of my boat <lb/>
            which caused him suddenly to relax his <lb/>
            severity. The wrinkles on his brow <lb/>
            cleared; he even smiled at me, and <lb/>
            assured me that he was ready to render <lb/>
            me any service that lay in his power. <lb/>
            So prompt an alteration made his friend­ <lb/>
            liness suspicious, and clearly showed that <pb n="99"/>
            <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_ATHENIAN_SOC_01_fig101.jpg"/></figure> <lb/>
               <pb n="99"/>
              his intentions were anything but good; <lb/>
              alas ! his kindness was only skinned over, <lb/>
              for, when the money became due, he <lb/>
              claimed the interest with the capital, and <lb/>
              refused to grant me so much as an <lb/>
              hour's grace. Then I recognised the <lb/>
              real Chremes of Phoela, the common <lb/>
              enemy of mankind, who may usually <lb/>
              be found before the Diometian Gate, <lb/>
              armed with a crooked stick. He was <lb/>
              actually making preparations to seize my <lb/>
              boat. Then I perceived in what a cruel <lb/>
              plight I was. I ran home with all speed, <lb/>
              took from my wife's neck the golden <lb/>
              necklace which I had given her in my <lb/>
              more prosperous days, and sold it to the <lb/>
              money-changer Paseon. With the money <lb/>
              I got I paid both the capital and the inte­ <lb/>
              rest, and I took an oath to myself that in <lb/>
              future I would rather die of hunger than <lb/>
              ever apply again to a city money-lender. <lb/>

          <p>THE sun-dial does not yet mark the <lb/>
            sixth hour, and I am in danger of wasting <lb/>
            away under the pinch of hunger. Come, <lb/>
            it is time to take counsel, Lopadectham­ <lb/>
            bus, or rather, let us get a beam and a <lb/>
            rope and hang ourselves. But I have an <lb/>
            idea. If we were to throw down the <lb/>
            whole column which supports that con­ <lb/>
            founded dial, or turn the index so that it <lb/>
            may make the hours seem to have gone <lb/>
            faster, it will be a device worthy of Pala­ <lb/>
            medes. I am exhausted and parched with <lb/>
            hunger. Theochares never takes his seat <lb/>
            at table until the servant runs to let him <lb/>
            know that it is the sixth hour. We <lb/>
            therefore need some plan to outwit and <lb/>
            overreach the regularity of Theochares. <lb/>
            For, as he has been brought up under <lb/>
            the care of a stern and morose tutor, his <pb n="101"/>

          <p>YESTERDAY, late in the evening, Gor­ <lb/>
            gias, of the family of the Eteobudatae, <lb/>
            meeting me by chance, greeted me cour­ <lb/>
            teously, and reproached me for not going <lb/>
            to see him more frequently. Then, after <lb/>
            a few playful words, he said to me, " Go, <lb/>
            by Jupiter, my good friend, have a bath <lb/>
            and come back to me without delay. <lb/>
            Do not forget to bring Aedonium, with <lb/>
            whom I am very intimate, and who, as <lb/>
            you know, is always to be found near <lb/>
            the Leocorium. I have prepared a noble <lb/>
            supper, slices of fish, and jars of wine <lb/>
            from Mendos, which you would say was <lb/>
            the nectar of the gods." With these <lb/>
            words, he left me. I ran in all haste to <lb/>
            Aedonium ; and when I told her by <lb/>
            whom she had been invited, I nearly <lb/>
            got into trouble. For, as it seems, she <pb n="103"/>

              had found Gorgias ungrateful and mean <lb/>
              in the matter of presents in return for <lb/>
              her favours. In her anger, which is <lb/>
              ever rankling in her breast, she snatched <lb/>
              a full kettle from the stove, and, unless <lb/>
              I had avoided the danger by quickly <lb/>
              starting back, she would have poured <lb/>
              all its contents over the top of my head. <lb/>
              Thus, after feeding ourselves on idle <lb/>
              hopes, do we gain a greater share of <lb/>
              humiliation than of pleasure.</p><pb n="104"/>

            cannot endure slaps in the face, and all <lb/>
            the drunken insults of these cursed <lb/>
            diners; and yet I cannot control my <lb/>
            confounded and gluttonous stomach. It <lb/>
            is always asking for more; it is not <lb/>
            satisfied with being filled, but clamours <lb/>
            for luxuries. But my face cannot stand <lb/>
            blows one after the other, and I am in <lb/>
            danger of having one of my eyes bunged <lb/>

            me, half-dead, or rather a corpse, an <lb/>
            inhabitant of the nether world, and <lb/>
            ordered his pupils to pick me up and <lb/>
            carry me home, and, after administering <lb/>
            an emetic to me, bled me till the <lb/>
            blood flowed plentifully, nothing could <lb/>
            have saved me from dying before I <lb/>

              than the skin of my belly could hold. One <lb/>
              stuffed me with sausages, another rammed <lb/>
              a great hunk of bread down my throat, <lb/>
              while another made me drink a mixture, <lb/>
              not wine, but mustard, fish-sauce, and <lb/>
              vinegar, just as if he were pouring it <lb/>
              into a cask. What a number of pots, <lb/>
              pans, and pails I filled, when I brought <lb/>
              all this up ! Acesilaus was utterly asto­ <lb/>
              nished, and could not make out where <lb/>
              and how I had managed to stow away <lb/>
              such a mish-mash of food. But now that <lb/>
              the protecting and tutelary gods have <lb/>
              visibly preserved me from a great danger, <lb/>
              I will in future work. I will go down <lb/>

              hire from the vessels to the warehouses. <lb/>

            suddenly started a hare which was con­ <lb/>
            cealed in the brushwood. My sons un­ <lb/>

            were on the point of catching the hare, <lb/>

            surrounded by flatterers, such as Gryllion <lb/>
            and Pataecion. At the same time, the <lb/>

            But, while they were busily engaged <lb/>

          <p>WHEN the noonday heat was at its <lb/>
            height, I selected a pine-tree, which was <lb/>
            swept by the wind and exposed to the <lb/>
            breeze, and threw myself beneath its shade <lb/>
            to escape from the sweltering heat. While <lb/>
            I was cooling myself very comfortably, the <lb/>
            idea came into my head to try a little <lb/>
            music. I took my pipe; I gently moved <lb/>
            my tongue up and down its reeds, and <lb/>
            played a sweet pastoral melody. Mean­ <lb/>
            while, all my goats collected round me <lb/>
            from all directions, enchanted, I know not <lb/>
            why, by the sweet strains. They forgot to <lb/>
            browse upon the arbutus and asphodel, <lb/>
            and gave no thought to anything but the <lb/>
            music. At that time I was like the son <lb/>
            of Calliope in the midst of the Edonians. <lb/>

              this pleasant story is to let a friend know <lb/>

          <p>WHEN the season for planting came, <lb/>
            I was on the point of setting some young <lb/>
            olive-trees, and watering them with water <lb/>
            from the spring, which was brought to <lb/>
            me from the neighbouring valley. " I had <lb/>
            already marked out the holes and dug <lb/>
            trenches. Unfortunately, a storm of rain <lb/>
            came on, which, for three days and as <lb/>
            many nights, drove down from the sum­ <lb/>
            mit of the mountains regular rivers, which, <lb/>
            in their impetuous course, have filled the <lb/>
            trenches with mud. All my fields have <lb/>
            the same level; there is no trace of cul­ <lb/>
            tivation ; all my labour is lost. The <lb/>

            come and help me. For, being alone and <lb/>
            infirm, I have not ventured to lay hands <lb/>
            upon him myself. He has a savage look <lb/>
            and arches his brows, his shoulders are <lb/>
            stalwart, his legs are stout and strong; <lb/>
            whereas I am exhausted by labour and <lb/>

          <p>You remember the day when I had <lb/>
            loaded my ass with green and dried figs ? <lb/>
            After I had taken him to the stable, and <lb/>
            sold the figs to one of my friends, someone <lb/>
            took me to the theatre, where he put me <lb/>
            into a good place, and gave me a treat of <lb/>
            all kinds of spectacles. Although I forgot <lb/>
            what else I saw-since I am not at all <lb/>
            clever at understanding or giving an ac­ <lb/>
            count of such things-I remember one <lb/>
            thing, which struck me dumb with as­ <lb/>
            tonishment. A man came forward with <lb/>
            a three-legged table. On this he placed <lb/>
            three little cups, under which he hid <lb/>
            some little round white pebbles, such <lb/>
            as we find on the bank of a torrent. <lb/>
            At one time he put them separately, one <lb/>
            under each cup ; at another time he <lb/>
            showed them, all together, under one cup ; <pb n="124"/>
            <figure type="illustration">

              then he made them disappear from the <lb/>
              cups, I don't know how, and showed them, <lb/>
              the next moment, in his mouth. After <lb/>
              this he swallowed them, called some of <lb/>
              the spectators on to the platform, and <lb/>
              pulled out of their nose, head, and ears <lb/>
              the pebbles which he ended by juggling <lb/>
              away altogether. What a clever thief <lb/>
              the man must be, far sharper than Eury­ <lb/>
              bates of Oechalia, of whom we have often <lb/>
              heard. I am sure I don't want to see <lb/>
              him in the country; since nobody would <lb/>
              be able to catch him in the act, he <lb/>
              would plunder the house without being <lb/>
              noticed. What then would become of the <lb/>
              fruit of my labours ?</p><pb n="125"/>

              has been stretched on his back, lifeless, <lb/>

              Good-bye to country life and all that I <lb/>

          <p>I LOVE to cull the fruits of the earth, <lb/>

            larly fond of is to rob the hives of their <lb/>
            honey. I have just paid a visit to some <lb/>
            hives which I found amongst the rocks. <lb/>
            They have provided me with some honey­ <lb/>
            combs, quite fresh. I offered the first- <lb/>
            fruits of them to the gods; you, my <lb/>
            friends, must now have a share of what <lb/>
            is left. They are white in colour, and <lb/>
            distil drops of Attic honey, such as is <lb/>
            found in the caverns of Brilessus. For the <lb/>
            moment, I send you this as a present; <lb/>
            next year you shall have something bigger <lb/>
            and more agreeable. <note type="footnote"> 17</note> </p><pb n="129"/>

          <p>IT seems to me that I am keeping a <lb/>
            wolf in my house. My confounded slave <lb/>
            falls upon my goats and does not spare <lb/>
            a single one; he has sold some, and <lb/>
            sacrificed others. His belly is swollen with <lb/>
            gorging, and he spends what he has left <lb/>
            on his gluttony. He amuses himself with <lb/>
            pipe and flute-players, and delights in <lb/>
            the perfumers' shops. In the meantime <lb/>
            the stalls are deserted, and the flocks of <lb/>
            goats which I once had have disappeared. <lb/>
            However, I keep quite quiet, that he may <lb/>
            not get suspicious and take to flight. In <lb/>
            this manner I hope to surprise him. If v <lb/>
            I catch hold of him, he shall have his <lb/>
            hands bound, and he shall be made to drag <lb/>
            heavy chains along with him. Then, the <lb/>
            rake, the pick, and the hoe shall help <lb/>
            him to forget his luxurious habits; he <lb/>
            shall learn to his sorrow what it means to <lb/>
            choose the temperate life of a countryman. <note type="footnote"> 17—2 </note></p><pb n="130"/>

            I did not run away, or hide myself in <lb/>

          <p>THE winter is very severe this year, <lb/>
            and no one is able to go out. The snow <lb/>
            has not only covered the earth, it has <lb/>
            also whitened the hills and valleys. One <lb/>
            must give up all idea of work, although <lb/>
            it is disgraceful to remain idle. To amuse <lb/>
            myself, I tried to look out. No sooner <lb/>
            was my door opened than I saw, together <lb/>
            with the falling snow, a regular flock of <lb/>
            blackbirds and thrushes. I had some <lb/>
            birdlime all ready prepared in a jar, and <lb/>
            quickly smeared it over some wild pear- <lb/>
            tree branches. The birds flung themselves <lb/>
            upon it in swarms, and then found them­ <lb/>
            selves caught by the branches. It was a <lb/>
            treat to see them-some hanging by their <lb/>
            wings, others by the head or claws. I <lb/>
            picked out a couple of dozen of the <lb/>
            fattest and plumpest amongst them, and <lb/>
            I send them to you. Honest people ought <lb/>

            parasites, like ourselves. His misfortunes <lb/>
            have altered his opinion of mankind, and <lb/>
            he has become as great a misanthrope as <lb/>
            Apemantus. He has retired to a field a <lb/>
            long way off, where he throws clods of <lb/>
            earth at the passers-by, or hides himself, <lb/>
            to avoid meeting anyone, so great is his <lb/>
            abhorrence of his fellow-men. On the <lb/>
            other hand, the other Athenians, who <lb/>
            have lately come into money, are meaner <lb/>
            than Phidon or Gniphon. How is one to <lb/>
            live ? I think I shall leave the city and <lb/>
            try and earn my living by hard work. <lb/>
            Take me as a hired labourer on your <lb/>
            farm. I will put up with anything, if <lb/>
            only I can satisfy my insatiable maw.</p><pb n="140"/>

          <p>A VERY great drought prevails just <lb/>
            now; there is not a cloud in the sky. <lb/>
            We want rain ; the soil is so dry that our <lb/>
            land is parched. In vain have we offered <lb/>
            sacrifice to Jupiter God of Rain. All we <lb/>
            inhabitants of the village have done our <lb/>
            best to appease him with our gifts, ac­ <lb/>
            cording to our means. One contributed <lb/>
            a ram, another a goat; those who were <lb/>
            not so well off gave a sacrificial cake; those <lb/>
            whose means were even less, a few mouldy <lb/>
            grains of incense. It is true that no one <lb/>
            sacrificed a bull; but we have no large <lb/>
            cattle, since we live on the poor soil of <lb/>
            Attica. All our expenses have been use­ <lb/>
            less ; it seems as if Jupiter devoted his <lb/>

            of ours.</p><pb n="141"/>

          <p>AH ! what trouble the soldier brought <lb/>
            upon us! After his arrival in the evening, <lb/>
            when, in an ill-starred moment, he took <lb/>
            up his quarters with us, he never ceased <lb/>
            to din into our ears stories about decuries, <lb/>
            phalanxes, pikes, shields, and cross-bows. <lb/>
            Then he told 'us how he had routed the <lb/>
            Thracians and run their captain through <lb/>
            with his lance; and, after that, how he <lb/>
            pierced an Armenian through and through. <lb/>
            Finally, he produced his prisoners, and <lb/>
            exhibited the women, whom, he declares, <lb/>
            he received from different generals as the <lb/>
            reward of his gallantry. I poured out a <lb/>

            larger ones after it, but it did not stop <lb/>
            him; he still went on chattering.</p><pb n="142"/>

            me, led by Moschion, who, as soon as I <lb/>
            lost my dear husband, incessantly worried <lb/>
            me to marry him, but I refused, partly <lb/>
            out of pity for my little ones, and partly <lb/>
            because I could not forget the deceased <lb/>
            Phaedrias. But I unwittingly kept my­ <lb/>
            self for a disgraceful amour, and found a <lb/>
            nuptial chamber in a grove. He took me <lb/>
            into a shady part of the forest, where the <lb/>
            trees grew thickly together, and there, on <lb/>
            the top of the flowers and leaves, he <lb/>
            compelled me to endure-I am ashamed <lb/>

            Phrygian, who has turned out so in the <lb/>
            country. Since I picked him out of a <lb/>

            last day of the month, I immediately de­ <lb/>
            termined to call him Numenius.1 As he <lb/>
            seemed to be strong and looked sharp, I <lb/>
            was glad to take him away to help me <lb/>
            on my farm in the country. But he has <lb/>
            turned out a sheer loss to me; he eats <lb/>
            as much food as four diggers, and he <lb/>
            sleeps, as I heard a crazy sophist say, <lb/>
            like Epimenides the Cretan, or for three <lb/>

            I hear that the disgusting and effeminate <lb/>

          <p>WHAT a stroke of luck I have had! <lb/>
            Perhaps you will ask me how. Well, I <lb/>
            will tell you, and you will have no need <lb/>
            to inquire. The city, as you know, was <lb/>
            celebrating the Cureotis, and I, having <lb/>
            been invited to the feast to amuse the <lb/>
            guests, was dancing the cordax. The <lb/>
            banqueters vied with one another in <lb/>
            drinking, and the contest went on with­ <lb/>
            out stopping, until drunkenness overcame <lb/>
            them all, and at length they became <lb/>
            drowsy and fell asleep, even the servants. <lb/>
            I looked round to see if I could filch <lb/>
            some of the plate; but since this had <lb/>
            been put away out of sight, in a place of <lb/>
            safety, while they were still sober, I took <lb/>
            a napkin under my arm and ran away <lb/>
            in such a hurry that, during my flight, <lb/>
            I lost one of my slippers. Look what ex­ <pb n="159"/>

            filched a silver pitcher from the wealthy <lb/>
            Phanius, and had taken to flight; it was <lb/>
            the dead of night, and I made all haste <lb/>
            to get safely away. Suddenly the house­ <lb/>
            dogs, of Molossian and Cnosian breed, <lb/>
            rushed upon me from all sides, and, <lb/>
            barking loudly and fiercely, attacked me. <lb/>
            I barely escaped being torn to pieces by <lb/>
            them, as if I had offended Diana, so that <lb/>
            not even my extremities would have re­ <lb/>
            mained for burial the next day, if any <lb/>
            kind people had wanted to show their <lb/>
            pity and sympathy. 'Finding, by good <lb/>
            luck, an open watercourse of no great <lb/>
            depth, I jumped into it and concealed <lb/>
            myself. It makes me shake and tremble <note type="footnote"> 21 </note> <pb n="161"/>

              even now to tell you. As soon as it <lb/>
              was daybreak, I heard their barking no <lb/>
              more, for they had all been tied up in <lb/>
              the house. I immediately hurried down <lb/>
              to the Piraeus, and, finding a Sicilian <lb/>
              vessel just about to set sail, I sold my <lb/>
              pitcher to the skipper, so that I now <lb/>
              have my pockets full of money. I have <lb/>
              returned, newly enriched, and I am in <lb/>
              such a flutter of expectation that I am <lb/>
              eager to support some flatterers, and to ' <lb/>
              keep parasites of my own, instead of <lb/>
              being one myself. When I have spent <lb/>
              the money I have just gained, I shall <lb/>
              return to my old profession. A dog who <lb/>
              has once become accustomed to gnaw <lb/>
              leather will never forget the habit. <note type="footnote"> 21—2 </note></p><pb n="162"/>

              besides the noise this made, I was bathed in <lb/>
              blood; and all the guests burst out into <lb/>
              most immoderate shouts of laughter. And <lb/>
              what adequate recompense did I receive <lb/>

              for my insults was-that I got a bellyful, <lb/>

              I feel compassion for the youth, for, as <lb/>
              soon as he became his own master, he <lb/>
              showed great kindness to us; it will <lb/>
              be a great misfortune for us, if he is <lb/>

          <p>I HAVE travelled over the countries <lb/>
            watered by the Eurotas and Lerna's marsh; <lb/>
            I have seen the streams of Pirene; now <lb/>
            I eagerly leave Corinth for Athens, and <lb/>
            return with renewed affection to the <lb/>
            fountain of Callirhoe. The luxury" and <lb/>
            festivities of those places have no charms <lb/>

          <p>The inhabitants of Peloponnesus ap­ <lb/>

            than pleasure. For this reason, I prefer <lb/>
            to content myself with the figs and raisins <lb/>
            of Attica, rather than run the risk of <lb/>
            growing thin for the gold of Corinth. <lb/>

            Let Gronthon and Sardanapalus do what <lb/>

          <p>YESTERDAY, while Charion was busy <lb/>
            at the well, I slipped into the kitchen. <lb/>
            There I saw a large dish filled with ex­ <lb/>
            quisite dainties, a roast fowl, and a pot <lb/>
            containing anchovies and sardines from <lb/>
            Megara. I seized hold of it, and, hastily <lb/>
            retiring, looked about for a convenient <lb/>
            spot whither I might betake myself to <lb/>
            have a comfortable meal. As I could <lb/>
            not find any place handy, I ran to <lb/>
            the Painted Porch, and, as it just <lb/>
            happened to be the time when it was not <lb/>
            infested by any chattering philosophers, I <lb/>
            began to enjoy the fruit of my labours. <lb/>
            But, looking up from my dish, I saw ap­ <lb/>
            proaching one of those young men from <lb/>
            the gaming-table, and, seized with alarm, <lb/>
            I threw what I was eating behind me, <lb/>
            and flung myself on the ground, intend­ <pb n="173"/>

              ing to conceal my theft. I prayed to <lb/>
              the averting gods that the storm might <lb/>
              pass by, promising them some grains of <lb/>
              incense, which I had picked up at the <lb/>
              sacrifices and keep at home, although <lb/>
              they are quite mouldy. My prayers were <lb/>
              heard; for the gods made him turn <lb/>
              in another direction. Having hurriedly <lb/>
              gulped down all that was in the dishes, <lb/>
              I gave the plate, the pot, and the frag­ <lb/>

              tavern-keeper, and departed, having thus <lb/>

          <p>PERHAPS you will ask me why I am <lb/>
            weeping, how I got my skull broken, <lb/>
            and why I am wearing this fine coat <lb/>
            torn to rags. I won some money-would <lb/>
            to Heaven I never had! What right <lb/>
            had I, weak as I was, to pit myself <lb/>
            against stalwart young men ? When I <lb/>
            had swept in all the stakes, and they <lb/>
            were entirely cleaned out, they all fell <lb/>
            upon me; some beat me with their fists, <lb/>
            others pelted me with stones, and others <lb/>
            tore my clothes. But I kept tight hold <lb/>
            of my money, resolved to die rather than <lb/>
            surrender any of my winnings to them. <lb/>
            For a time I resisted bravely, enduring <lb/>
            the blows they dealt me, and the wrench­ <lb/>
            ing of my fingers; I was like a Spartan <lb/>
            who is being flogged at the altar of <lb/>

              that I endured this treatment, but at <lb/>
              Athens, and at the hands of the most <lb/>
              rascally gamblers in the city. At last, <lb/>

            What a banquet you missed, when Sca­ <lb/>
            monides gave a feast in honour of his <lb/>
            daughter's birthday. Having recently in­ <lb/>
            vited a number of the wealthiest and <lb/>
            noblest in Athens, he thought it his duty <lb/>
            also to grace the festivities with the <lb/>
            presence of philosophers. Amongst these <lb/>
            was Euthycles the Stoic, an old man <lb/>
            with a long beard, dirty, filthy-headed, <lb/>
            decrepit, with more wrinkles in his fore­ <lb/>
            head than a leather pouch. There were <lb/>
            also present Themistagoras the Peripa­ <lb/>
            tetic, not an unpleasant person to look <lb/>
            at, with a fine curly beard; Zenocrates <lb/>
            the Epicurean, with carefully trimmed <lb/>
            locks, and a long and venerable beard; <note type="footnote"> 23 </note> <pb n="177"/>

              the " famous " Archibius the Pythagorean, <lb/>
              as he is called,, with a very pale face, <lb/>
              waving hair that reached down to his <lb/>
              chest, a long and pointed chin, a turned­ <lb/>
              up nose, lips drawn in and tightly com­ <lb/>
              pressed, an indication of his reserve. <lb/>
              Suddenly Pancrates the Cynic, violently <lb/>
              thrusting the others aside, forced his way <lb/>
              in, leaning on a staff of holm-oak, which, <lb/>
              in place of thick knots, was studded with <lb/>
              brass nails, and carrying an empty wallet, <lb/>
              conveniently slung for carrying away the <lb/>
              remains of the feast. All the other guests, <lb/>
              from beginning to end, maintained a uni­ <lb/>
              form and orderly behaviour; but the <lb/>
              philosophers, as the entertainment went <lb/>
              on, and the wine-cup went round, began <lb/>
              to behave in a most extraordinary fashion. <lb/>
              Euthycles the Stoic, overcome by his years <lb/>
              and having eaten and drunk too much, <lb/>
              lay stretched out at full length, snor­ <lb/>
              ing loudly. The Pythagorean, breaking <lb/>
              through his silence, began to trill the <lb/>

              air. The excellent Themistagoras, who, <lb/>

              mental advantages alone, but also in ex­ <lb/>
              ternal enjoyment, asked for more pastry, <lb/>
              and plenty of different dainties; Zeno­ <lb/>
              crates the Epicurean took the girl who <lb/>
              played the harp in his arms, looking at <lb/>
              her wantonly and lasciviously with half­ <lb/>
              shut eyes, declaring that this quieted the <lb/>
              desires of the flesh, and was the per­ <lb/>
              fection of enjoyment. The Cynic, with <lb/>
              the indifference of his sect, let down his <lb/>
              cloak and publicly made water, and then <lb/>
              proceeded to copulate with Doris the <lb/>
              singing-girl, so that everyone could see <lb/>
              him, declaring that nature was the prin­ <lb/>
              ciple of generation. No one took any <lb/>
              notice of us parasites; none of those who <lb/>

              Sannyrion and Philistiades were not <lb/>
              absent. But it was all in vain; these <lb/>

              nonsense of the sophists was the only <lb/>

          <p>HAVING taken too much wine, I <lb/>
            ridiculed Zopyrus, the young master's <lb/>
            tutor. From that time, perhaps from <lb/>
            listening to accusations against us, he <lb/>
            has been less liberal, and treats us rather <lb/>
            stingily. On feast days he used to send <lb/>
            me a coat, or a cloak, or an upper gar­ <lb/>
            ment ; but lately, just before the Sa­ <lb/>
            turnalia, he sent me a pair of new shoes <lb/>
            by Dromio. The latter gave himself airs <lb/>
            about it, and asked me to pay him for <lb/>
            his trouble; but I feel terribly vexed, <lb/>
            and bite my hasty tongue, and see that <lb/>
            I was wrong, now that it is too late; for, <lb/>
            when words flow without reason to guide <lb/>
            them, the tongue is bound to make mis­ <lb/>
            takes. Farewell.</p><pb n="181"/>

          <p>I DON'T mind you in the least, al­ <lb/>
            though you threaten to whisper about <lb/>
            me, and patch up disgraceful accusations <lb/>
            against me. For the Malian soldier, who <lb/>
            keeps me in food, is a simple and honour­ <lb/>
            able man. Far from being jealous in the <lb/>
            matter of women, only lately, when his <lb/>
            tongue began to wag freely at table, he <lb/>
            heaped abuse upon those who allow <lb/>
            themselves to be jealous. He said that <lb/>
            the duty of married women was to look <lb/>
            after their household affairs and to lead <lb/>
            a chaste life; but that courtesans ought <lb/>
            to be looked upon as common property <lb/>
            for all who wanted them. Just as we <lb/>
            use the baths and their appliances in <lb/>

            to belong to one person, so is it with <lb/>

              courtesans. Therefore, since I know that <lb/>

            I will pay him the two drachmas which <lb/>

            to communicate to you also, as a friend, <lb/>
            my strange and incredible vision. I <lb/>
            thought I was a handsome young man, <lb/>
            no ordinary person, but Ganymede, the <lb/>
            son of Tros, the beloved and beautiful <lb/>
            boy of Ilium. I had a shepherd's crook <lb/>
            and a pipe; my head was encircled with <lb/>
            a Phrygian tiara, and I was tending a <lb/>
            flock of sheep on Mount Ida. Suddenly, <lb/>
            a large eagle, with crooked talons and <lb/>
            bent beak, and a savage look, flew <pb n="184"/>

              towards me, lifted me up in his claws <lb/>
              from the rock on which I was sitting, <lb/>
              and flew away with me into the air up <lb/>
              to heaven: when I was close to the <lb/>
              gates, guarded by the Hours, I fell, <lb/>
              smitten by a thunderbolt; and methought <lb/>
              the bird was no longer the mighty eagle, <lb/>
              swooping down from the clouds, but a <lb/>
              vulture, stinking foully, and I was the <lb/>
              same Limenterus as I am now, without <lb/>
              any clothes on, as if I had been getting <lb/>
              ready for the bath or the wrestling­ <lb/>
              ground. Greatly shaken, as was natural, <lb/>
              by such a fall, I awoke. I am still <lb/>
              troubled by the strange vision; and I <lb/>
              want to find out from those who are ex­ <lb/>
              perienced in such things what is the <lb/>
              meaning of my dream, if anyone really <lb/>
              knows for certain, and is willing to tell <lb/>
              me the truth. <note type="footnote"> 24 </note></p><pb n="185"/>

          <p>I HAVE not been to Corinth again; <lb/>

            ners of its rich men, and the misery of its <lb/>
            poor. After most of them had been to <lb/>
            the bath, when it was midday, I saw <lb/>
            some talkative and comely young men, <lb/>
            who were sauntering, not round the <lb/>
            houses, but in the neighbourhood of the <lb/>
            Craneium, where the bakers' and fruit­ <lb/>
            erers' shops are. With their eyes bent <lb/>
            upon the ground, one picked up bean­ <lb/>
            pods, another carefully examined nut­ <lb/>
            shells, to see if any of the kernel had <lb/>
            been left in them accidentally, while <lb/>
            another peeled off with his nails pome­ <lb/>
            granate-skins (which we Athenians call <lb/>
            Sidia), to see if he could lay hands on <lb/>
            any of the seeds; while others picked <lb/>

            thrown over me yesterday, with soap and <lb/>
            Chalastraean nitre! It was not so much <lb/>
            the insult itself that annoyed me as that <lb/>
            it was undignified. I am the son of An­ <lb/>

            Athens; my mother Axiothea is descended <lb/>
            from Megacles; while the father of the <lb/>
            man who treated me like this is some <lb/>
            low fellow, and his mother a barbarian, <lb/>
            a Scythian or Colchian slave, bought at <lb/>
            the monthly fair: at least, some of my <lb/>
            acquaintances have told me so. And <lb/>
            now I, having lost all the fortune that <lb/>

            content if I can procure enough to satisfy <lb/>

          <p>You know the reason why the women <lb/>

            me, telling me to go to the devil for a <lb/>

            amongst them which they keep more care­ <lb/>
            fully than the Eleusinian mysteries, and <lb/>
            they try to conceal it from us, who know <lb/>

            we have heard of it, we do not believe <lb/>

            carry to the summit of Mount Parnes, <lb/>

              she knows that the youth is mad with <lb/>
              desire, but refuses to yield to him, and <lb/>
              declares that he shall not enjoy her <lb/>

              she has behaved more like a friend than <lb/>
              a prostitute! Since that time I have <lb/>
              been loaded with handsome presents; if <lb/>
              they pour in upon me even more abun­ <lb/>

              For she to whom I owe my support has <lb/>
              every right to share my comforts. <note type="footnote"> 25—2 </note></p><pb n="194"/>

          <p>THE vessel from Istria, which is an­ <lb/>

            good luck. One of its passengers is the <lb/>
            wonderful merchant, whose lavish open­ <lb/>
            handedness makes the wealthiest and <lb/>
            most generous of our citizens seem mean <lb/>
            and niggardly by comparison. He has <lb/>

            expensive courtesans, the most beautiful <lb/>
            singing-girls, in fact, all who perform in <lb/>
            public. He is not squandering his patri­ <lb/>
            mony, but all the money he spends has <lb/>
            been honestly earned by himself. He is <lb/>
            fond of music, makes his stay in the city <lb/>

            to anybody. He is very pleasant to look <lb/>

          <p>You saw how that accursed barber who <lb/>
            lives by the roadside treated me; I mean <lb/>
            that chattering gossip, who offers his <lb/>
            mirrors for sale at Brentesium, who tames <lb/>
            jackdaws, and plays a kind of tune with <lb/>
            his razors. When I went to him to get <lb/>
            shaved, he received me most politely, <lb/>
            made me sit down in a high chair, and <lb/>
            put a clean cloth round my neck; then <lb/>
            he gently drew the razor over my cheeks, <lb/>
            and took off my thick hairs. But, in <lb/>
            doing this, he was cunning and mis­ <lb/>
            chievous, for he only half shaved me, <lb/>
            and left one part ofmy face rough, while <lb/>
            the other was smooth. I, knowing <lb/>
            nothing of the trick he had played me, <lb/>
            went as usual to Pasion's house, with­ <lb/>
            out waiting to be invited. When the <lb/>

              out what had excited their mirth, until <lb/>
              one of them came forward into the <lb/>
              middle of the room and caught hold of <lb/>
              and pulled at the hairs which had been <lb/>
              left. I took a knife, and, feeling greatly <lb/>

            like lightning, her charming figure and <lb/>

            attempted to kiss her; then, when I came <lb/>

            when those thrice-accursed clubmen tried <lb/>
            to throw a kettle of boiling water over <lb/>
            me I saw what they were ready to do <lb/>
            when I was a long way off, and jumped <lb/>
            out of the way. They poured at random, <lb/>

          <p>I WAS fairly intimate with Corydon <lb/>
            the farmer, who often used to laugh <lb/>
            heartily at me, since he understood city <lb/>
            wit better than country people usually do. <lb/>
            When I first saw him, I thought it would <lb/>
            be a regular piece of luck for me, if I <lb/>
            could give up a city life and retire to <lb/>
            the country, and live with a friend who <lb/>
            passed his life quietly working on his <lb/>
            farm ; then I need no longer think about <lb/>
            making money by questionable practices <lb/>
            in the courts, but could wait patiently <lb/>
            to enjoy the fruits of the earth. Having <lb/>
            determined to do this, I made friends <lb/>
            with Corydon, dressed myself like a <lb/>
            countryman, clad myself in a sheepskin, <lb/>
            took up a mattock, and got myself up <lb/>
            as a regular ditcher. As long as I did <lb/>
            this for amusement, it was endurable, <lb/>
            and I thought I had made a very good <note type="footnote">26—2 </note> <pb n="202"/>

              bargain, since I was free from blows and <lb/>
              insults, and the unequal footing on which <lb/>
              I stood with my wealthy patrons; but <lb/>
              when he made a daily practice of order­ <lb/>
              ing me to work, and I had either to <lb/>
              plough, clear the stony ground, dig holes, <lb/>
              or plant in the ditches, then this kind of <lb/>
              life became unbearable; I repented of my <lb/>
              foolish act, and longed for the city again. <lb/>
              When I returned after my long absence, I <lb/>
              did not meet with the same reception as <lb/>
              before; instead of being looked upon as a <lb/>
              wit, I was considered rough and unculti­ <lb/>
              vated, in fact, a regular boor. All the <lb/>
              houses of the wealthy were from that time <lb/>
              forth shut against me, and hunger knocked <lb/>
              at the doors of my belly. Hard pressed <lb/>
              for the bare necessaries of life, I joined a <lb/>
              band of Megarian brigands, who lie in wait <lb/>
              for travellers near the Scironian rocks; <lb/>
              and since then I have gained a dishonest <lb/>
              livelihood without working. I do not <lb/>
              know whether I shall escape detection ; <lb/>
              but I am alarmed about my new pro­ <lb/>
              fession, for such a change of life generally <lb/>
              ends in destruction rather than safety.</p><pb n="203"/>
